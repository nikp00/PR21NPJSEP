Instead of 2 minutes, I had to wait 12+ hours to even get a reaction from the system of Binance: it failed. Yet my money was transfered... I thought 'hey maybe I didn't put the name of Binance as receiver', so I did a second one for 10‚Ç¨ today. Now with Binance as the receiver's name. Well, safe to say the problem isn't me and this one is going the same direction as my first one: failed but money transferred. Problem is I'm getting zero help (after making a ticket almost 24 hours ago). It's incredibly frustrating to see your money go and have zero support when the fault is theirs. I feel like talking to a wall right now. Imagine if I did this with much more money. And that's my biggest concern: how you want to become a stable market when things like that can happen and it takes ages to get support for it. As explained, I did everything asked, so the fault is not with me. I even checked with a second soon to be failed deposit I currently lost....",1

They put me on highest priority for a senior staff member but I have been waiting for a week and no one attend the chat. I'm very disappointed with Binance because it's such a big institution but holding customer's deposit without giving any reason.

CASE ID # 543152 Going on three weeks, all of a sudden my deposits were not being allowed even after I followed their instructions to the letter and tried to re-sync with Plaid, strange as I was verified and trading and had seamlessly deposited at least 10 times previously.

Well, I never received ‚Äú the Binance validation email ‚Äú to reactivate and my account has been locked for many days. No customer service assistance, only crickets.
