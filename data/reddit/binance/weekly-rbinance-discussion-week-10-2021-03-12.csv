1616033033,"It's the first thing I found irritating when I joined Binance.   They do a nice job by summing up your entire value as BTC and USD but they do not display any additional data.   I expected graphs, statistics..   My guess is that the majority of people lose so much money, they think it's a bad advertisement to display that. Might be the case, still missing it.",1
1616047490,"It blows my mind that anyone puts money in binance. I've just completed the verification steps and I'm shocked by so many parts of the process. The way it asks for your BANK username/password in a modal with ""plaid"" at the top. lol the fact that it doesnt allow file upload of drivers license and then throws that process to mobile app but doesnt seem to work on android devices. And my favorite, modal says I'm exceeding the limit while I can see in the background that the amount is less than the limit. If you have extra money and think of this as entertainment I think its fine. I would not consider this ""investing"" by any means. Put this money in and expect that it could be stolen or inaccessible in the future. That's what I'm doing anyway. I wouldnt put anything in binance that I wouldnt otherwise gamble somewhere else.",1

1615648806,"Idk I‚Äôve always had a few days delay with the funds actually leaving my bank. Only time this has been an issue was with Coinbase, who refunded my deposit to my bank for some reason, but still showed the money in Coinbase. Had no choice but to pay it back with the coins I bought, which ended up leaving me with some profit at no cost of my own, and then they locked me out of my account. That was the second time that happened but I didn‚Äôt get locked out last time. Never going back to them again.",2
