1617043266,What support? there isn’t one!,5
1617044969,They are not responding,3
1617198312,Yes its been 2 months and I've made 2 different support tickets and nothing has been said to me...What am I supposed to do? Sue them for 300 bucks idk.,2
1616872593,"I do use coinbase. I just dont get why, as a big company with all that money, this shouldn't be taking this long. This is a known issues with binance. It's a matter of hiring more people simple. And my request is fairly simple. But it keeps happening.  And watch they will get back to me once all these coins pump",1
1617243150,"If u transferred fiat from your bank to binance, they hold it for 10 days. At least that's how binanceUS",1
1617159609,They just emailed me to apologize for not responding earlier and to ask if I still needed help. Oy. So I explained the situation again. I'm hopeful for actual movement this week.,2
1616772607,But if i sell my beth back for my eth is it worth for your opinion?,1
1616896764,At least that's the point. And you're also promoting an upgrade to ethereum 2.0,1
1616896880,&#x200B; It looks like,2
1616868125,".us for me - it's been a week since my wire went through to them, however no customer support response or info on the site. I'm not sending them any more money...",2
1616858868,"Yeah I had the same issue! I went on their telegram and is seems a couple of people had this problem... I tried to do another transfer to test if I did things correctly, and then I saw the transfer to BSC was shutdown.. I think they might be doing maintenance.. now I check and it says the order is completed.. but still no funds in my metamask! Next time I will just use binance exchange as this is a joke... I’m losing money every hour this drags",1
1616951867,I don't even get to input a card. This messaje is after choosing the pair I want to buy and press continur,1
1616897997,Beep. Boop. I'm a robot. Here's a copy of  ###[Dracula](https://snewd.com/ebooks/dracula/) Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/),1
1616898183,"Pumpyfarm also liked the functionality. Automatic counting and easy operation. I also paid attention to dracula, it might be worth a look",1
1616898336,Thank you. I'll try it.,1
1617105935,"Same for withdraw, SEPA is gone. There is an alternative option: Coinbase PRO. With Coinbase Pro there is no other fee here than the 0.5% fiat-crypto trade, plus if you are referred you can get 10 USD (if you trade 100 USD or more). Here is my [ref link](https://www.coinbase.com/invite). You can  use coinbase to deposit or withdraw Fiat to/from your Revolut, if Binance is blocked on Revolut. On top of that you can do these online trainings that reward money on Coinbase, called: ""[Earn](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)"" (just made 30+ usd couple days ago).",0
1617272205,Thanks I’ve joined Coinbase but have been waiting days for the verification,1
1617199348,before reading this had moved it to exodus is this okay ?,1
1617379142,"Ok, so I shoukd just send? Is it the same eith Metamask?",1
1617274274,Standard,1
1616872910,Exactly. I've lost money already too. Insane.,2
1617243199,That's not the issue. It's already past that.,1
1616772932,"Just hold your BETH: when ethereum 2.0 is live, binance will exchange all BETH for ETH at a 1:1 ratio.  Only sell your BETH for ETH if you need it in an emergency. Note that you NEVER stake ETH for ETH2.0 in the ""ETH 2.0"" page on binance: instead go to https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BETH_ETH and buy BETH from other traders.",2
1616878223,[deleted],1
1616864069,True! Anyways my seems to work fine now and the transaction has been credited. Can you send me a link to their telegram?,1
1617274441,Doing you a favour. Binance is the worst place you can send money.,2
1616898214,Thanks for the tip.,1
1616898251,"I also heard about these two platforms. In general, I think these concepts are very interesting",1
1617275461,"Yes, once all that is sorted, it's very user friendly on Coinbase.  I found Binance to confusing at first, being new to crypto and convinced I'd lose money at every turn, now I actually prefer Binance for its graphs. Good luck with it all.",1
1617200137,>exodus  That's better and also safe. Ledger is just for the whales or people who are going to hold for 5+ years. At least that's my opinion.,1
1617389178,"Yes! Generally it is a good idea to send a tiny amount first, to make sure everything works.",1
1617243356,Is this with regular binance?,1
1616833301,"New to binance, only been on coinbase, can you explain to me why? Thanks",1
1616896805,Thanks for the link,1
1616889925,"There's a ton of other comments from people who also deposited correctly, however their funds didn't arrive for weeks or months. Sometimes rejected and they eventually got funds back. Mine were shown to be deposited correctly with all information binance.us requested as requested. They just suck - no customer support. Run.",1
1616890086,"Makes sense. I'd been using them for other transfers from my cards, so I assumed it was safe. My mistake.",1
1617243483,"[binance.us](https://binance.us) It's rumored they are staking our ADA so they can reap rewards. If that is the case for these unsupported withdrawals, then honestly fuck them. I want to move my ADA now.",2
1616849011,"Once you stake ETH, you get the same amount of it as BETH in a 1:1 ratio which you cannot exchange back to ETH until ETH 2.0 is ready. It could be 2 years or more. So the BETH-ETH spot market is where people trade these two crypto, and the price is usually less than 1, the difference representing the premium someone selling BETH is willing to pay to get back their ETH early, while it is the discount someone buying BETH is getting. Hence if you buy BETH with ETH instead of staking it in Binance ETH 2.0 page, it's basically the same thing, but at a discount. Take note that with BETH, if you cannot wait for the ETH 2.0 staking to be completed and want to get it back as ETH, you'll have to pay the ""premium"" too. *This is not financial advice. Don't trust what an Internet person says, verify it.*",1

1617251265,Once I can move my coins I move them out. At least the ones I can stake,1
1616849202,Thanks! That all makes sense,1
1616896566,Thank you for such a detailed response,1
1616924447,the 20% on ETH stake isnt better?,1
1616897060,"Still, safety is an important point.",1
1617257469,Exactly what I was planning to do lol after deposit cleared I was gonna move them to yoroi,2
1616849782,"Do read the FAQ at the ETH 2.0 page to find out more. From what I read elsewhere, the APY will drop over time as more ETH is being staked. It's probably gradual process though as there's a maximum rate at which ETH can be staked. So dropping APY, and falling value of ETH are possible risks of holding BETH (the equivalent of staking ETH in Binance).",1
1616926160,"In Binance, under the ETH 2.0 page, if you stake ETH, it gets converted to BETH. There's no 20% for staking ETH from within Binance. The curve yield graph on the ETH 2.0 page which starts from 20% and drops to 5% shows you an estimate of what the current APY is, depending on the total amount of ETH staked. At present, it is around 8%, and is no longer 20%.",2
1617266039,Sucks they hold the coin 10 days. It shouldn't take more than a couple of days to realize I have money in my account. Not 10 days. 10 days in crypto is like dog yrs lol,1
