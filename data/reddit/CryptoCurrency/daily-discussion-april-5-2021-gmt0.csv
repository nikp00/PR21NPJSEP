1617582326,"What a week it has been! So much to talk about! Let's start off the weekly recap a little bit different. * BTT has achieved top 20. Currently sitting at 1.1 cents at rank 14 and it just keeps pumping. * TRX is sitting in the top 20 once more. * On CG, WIN has entered the top 100, sitting at rank 69. This truly is Justin Sun's week to shine. * Back to our usual routine, the market cap ends at 1.95t. * The daily ends slightly over 10k, barely avoiding a crash. This week will continue being very green. * BTC didn't manage 60k, but BTC is one of the few underperformers. * ETH went up over 2k, and stayed there, even reaching over 2.1k. * BNB went back over 350, the burn announcement yet to come. * DOT kicked ADA out of the top 5, reaching a height of slightly over 45. * XRP saw further growth towards 65 cents. * Both UNI and LINK broke 30. * FIL temporarily hit top 10, now left it but sitting close by. Gasps a plenty. * XLM denied stablecoin position, puming to almost 47 cents, currently sitting at 44 cents. And it's not even the biggest surprise of the week. * Doge got pumped to 7 cents but quickly lost its momentum and fell back down to 5.7 cents. * VET keeps trying to hit 10 cents but not even beating the wall. Let's see if the new week shows different. * Aave sees itself over 400. * ATOM broke the 20 wall and stays above it. The world is once again astonished. * XMR went over 270, currently sitting over 260. (Ehmm... did I say XMR? I meant... some other coin!) * Many more keep on pumping and pumping. But BTC only up 5% from a week ago. * In the top 100 we see a lot of huge gainers this week. At the top right now by a long shot is new to top 100 WRX with 761% gains. BTT with almost 200% gains isn't feeling inferior, that's for sure. HOT with 176% gains and TRX with 103% gains are the other 100% gainers. 5 others see over 50% gains, 11 others see over 30% gains. * Over the week there's also a few losers, with BTMX at 30% loss and ONE with 23% loss being the sorest. * Into the top 500 weekly we see XYO, MED, APL and MTL with 200%+ gains, EL and MARO with 300%+ gains,  NRV and MCO with 400%+ gains, WIN with 500%+ gains and BAAS (Dutch for boss) ""leading"" with 680% gains. Though we do have an outlier with 25k% gains KIMCHI grew big, sitting on 600k volume. * For the top 500 losers of the week we see SPND with 52% loss, RNDR with 32% loss, BRG with 31% loss and plenty in the 20-30% region. * For Sunday alone we see WRX and BTT as clear top 100 winners with 142% and 72%. * WIN and MCO are Sunday's top 500 gainers with 106% and 370%. * Sunday losses we see down to a mere 10% with one outlier DAC with 26%. * In terms of daily shilling the big names are ETH, LTO, MOONS, ONE, HOT, BTT and WIN, with one day entirely dedicated to ETH. * The mental image of the week is a large field of apple-green grass with the people peacefully walking on it getting PTSD every time they see a little red flower.",84

1617621122,"Recently it has come to my attention on more than one occasion that many of our new members are using the term ""heavy bags"" like it's a good thing. For example, ""I can't wait to get some heavy bags of BTC"", or ""may your bags be heavy"". As if the larger your portfolio is, the heavier your bags become. That is not what we mean when we use the term ""heavy bags"" The term ""heavy bags"" indicates that since you purchased your shit coins, they have gone down in value, usually for a loooooooooooooooooooooooooong time, and maybe forever. Hence, they are ""heavy"" and hard to carry (hodl). This is NOT a good thing. HEAVY BAGS SUCK. Stop wishing them on me.

1617601353,"Socialized compounding DEX aggregators are undervalued. They're practically necessary to get ahead in this space, which means billions more will get locked on these platforms in the near future. Autofarm, for example, has 1.5b TVL after just 3 months, with 2.1m+ dollars in fees burned, yet it only has a market cap of 119m (325m fully diluted). ACS is decent too. They offer good yields and their stablecoin swap is VERY efficient. For example, on PancakeSwap you'd get 981821 USDT per million BUSD, whereas on ACS's StableSwap platform you'd get 999851. I think it's actually more efficient than Nerve Finance's flagship stable swap, and that one's valued at twice the fully diluted market cap.",4

People are just throwing money at low value coins and expecting lambos. This will end in tears. Like it does every time. One can hope ATOM gets its own pump due to being 20 dollars. But I imagine most people would consider that expensive so it‚Äôll end up being some POS coin worth 0.005 per coin that has infinite supply. A developer team that is me myself and I etc.,16
