1616172072,"Some notes from the Ethereum Core Dev meeting today: Any tension with miners over 1559 has subdued, community wide consensus that a large price drop _could_ risk mining profitability but that fixes could be swiftly implemented at that time and tailored to that situation. Better to do that than change and commit ETH monetary policy to a route that is likely unnecessary via a complex (and problematic) decay schedule. The London upgrade in July will include 1559 and other feature upgrades. This will likely be the last feature upgrade before the merge to full POS. The Shanghai upgrade aimed for October 2021 will be dedicated towards the merge to POS. Following London, everyone’s efforts will dive into making the merge happen as soon as possible. Withdrawals may not be included at that time, so staked ETH will be locked until the next feature upgrade.  This is all very bullish news. By the end of 2021 ETH will have a jungle of scaling solutions and a better fee market making it useful for everyone. Then it could also switch to full POS, largely removing any environmental FUD and further incentivising long term hodling via staking. This is just the base layer, never mind all the dapps building on top!",13

1616162008,"Okay, can someone tell me more about the potential flaws of the Terra ecosystem? Because from my I experience, I can't understand why it's not being discussed more for delivering a great DeFi ecosystem that small fish can actually use without getting wrecked by fees. I just recently discovered it with the Anchor Protocol launch and to be clear, I still don't own ANY Luna, Anchor, Mirror or any other asset. All I have is the UST stable coin. But from my experience, this is everything I was looking for from the DeFi experience. Anchor Protocol addresses all the concerns I've seen with other DeFi stable coin lending platforms. The fees are very low, usually cents per transaction from my experience. It's not centralized like Binance. The actual yields for stable coin lending on Anchor are great (20% fixed). And it has solid institutional backing, by firms like Galaxy Digital and Panterra Capital. The wildest thing for me is just how easy it all is to use with the TerraStation wallet. It's just 1 code to manage all native Terra assets in one place (LUNA, ANC, MIR, UST, etc.). By linking with the MIR wallet, you can get UST via USDC/USDT/BTC/ETH transfer for easy onboarding. And you can swap between all these assets (a la Uniswap) straight from the wallet, again minimal fees. I currently don't own any Terra assets besides UST, but I'm definitely going to check out Mirror and the rest of the ecosystem just because of how easy it is to switch between the assets. This sounds like a filthy shill post. I get it. That's why I want someone to tell me what I'm missing here, because the whole experience seems so next level compared to my experience with ETH-based platforms.",12

At the end of May 2020, Bayer announced working on a new blockchain-based traceability platform for the delivery of drugs. The pharmaceutical giant selected the company VeChain, a branch of Bayer, as tech provider for the new blockchain-powered solution that will allow to track clinical drugs along the entire supply chain. The system, known as CSecure, loads into a blockchain a batch number that is assigned to a specific drug. The number is then used to track the drug as it moves through the supply chain, registering timestamps and user-identification information at various route points. Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, the data cannot be changed or manipulated by any other third party [35]. CSecure is based on ToolChain, a proprietary blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) system that allows VeChain to design and develop blockchain-powered solutions to client’s specific requirements. Further information about CSecure cannot unfortunately be disclosed, as VeChain is bound by a non-disclosure agreement.""",9

I agree it does matter, not sure that it's all that matters though, since market cap for crypto is based upon current price.

Crypto finds itself in the doldrums for 30 minutes, and I begin micro analyzing every trade I’ve made over the last year, and every one of my holdings.  I’ve come to accept that the best thing for my financial future is to let the coins/tokens do the work for me. I need to stop chasing gains. I need to stop second guessing myself. I need to move away from FOMOing, and just let crypto be crypto.  Some, infinitely smarter than I, day trade, swing trade, trade on margin, and make ridiculous profits. I’ve tried, and that’s not for me. Instead, I  have decided to acquiesce. I’ll be “boring”, I’ll DCA, I’ll stay true to my decisions, I’ll stop chasing the hot token.

I expect they will be holding through it all, but is there some sort of (tax) advantage for them having their btc reserves at low value for a few years? Would they plan on casing out next run?

1616122523,"**Upcoming ATOM catalysts:** **1) The Gravity DEX**, an automated market maker that will allow ATOM holders to use their ATOMs to create liquidity pools and take a cut of the transaction fees. Governance proposal for the Gravity DEX just passed. **2) Interblockchain communication.** Stargate launch enabled the framework for IBC transfers, but the proposal to enable IBC transfers is in its voting period. I believe that once the first IBC transfers are made, money will flow into ATOM because it removes execution failure risk. It proves the tech and establishes ATOM as the first mover in the IBC space over competitors like DOT. **3) Institutional buying.** Grayscale has an open filing to create a Cosmos trust. Paradigm also recently bought $240M of ATOM and staked it. When execution risk is gone, I expect institutional buying to increase as well. **4) Potential supply squeeze.** Over 72% of ATOM is staked currently. As more people and institutions (like the aforementioned Grayscale Trust) want to buy into ATOM, there may not be enough liquid ATOM to go around, creating a supply squeeze, quickly sending ATOM to the moon. **5) Shared security ""rentals""**, coming Q4. Cosmos will continue allowing blockchains to retain sovereignty and maintain their own security model if they choose, but soon smaller chains which find it difficult to recruit enough validators can rent security from the #Cosmos Hub. I actually view shared security as one of ATOM's most important catalysts. $DOT having shared security has been its primary value prop over ATOM. With this, ATOM will be able to tap the market of chains that want sovereignty as well as chains that need shared security. If you're wondering if now is a good entry for ATOM, realize that it still hasn't retested its all time high. Any price under $26 is an excellent entry point. However, I personally believe that [ATOM will go all the way to $160](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx7wg5/daily_discussion_march_4_2021_gmt0/gpm305k/) during this bull run.",15

(20% is the biggest gainer now, it's bad!) * Today's top 100 biggest loser is none other than ADA. Though ADA superpositioned, ultimately its price fell. ADA under $1 by tomorrow confirmed. (I did the calculations! They are correct!) * I've been asked to shill some random coin that hasn't even managed to make it to the top 2000. Apparently its glorious rise deserves mentioning... cause that never happens to sub 2000 rank coins... * Looking a bit beyond the top 100, some random coin called KARMA (rank 262) has gained 160% in the past day. With my mention and being on Reddit, it will probably gain another 160%. * Today's mental image is a senior home with all dem oldies sitting on their chairs half asleep watching a game of golf.

1616148474,"Hi everyone. Still relatively new to crypto trading. I opened a BinanceUS account about two months ago and got verified (finally) a couple of weeks ago. I went with BinanceUS because everyone here recommends Binance. I’m now understanding there is a huge difference between Binance and BinanceUS. The latter just feels slightly unprofessional for a couple of reasons.  They took forever to verify my account and won’t take any support requests seriously regarding the lengthy and in-depth verification. It’s a little spooky giving out so much information and just waiting.. for longer than they describe on their app.  I suppose a lot of it boils down to the volume at which they are trading because they don’t offer half of the alt coins I see online. Granted, I knew I was going to put the majority of my capital for crypto into BTC/ETH and have built a small seed with that distribution. However, I knew I wanted to dedicate a percentage of crypto capital to alt coins and it’s extremely disappointing when I find out BinanceUS doesn’t trade that coin while several other places do. Also, while I haven’t experienced this yet, I’ve read several unsavory stories regarding inability to trade through the app. Having to buy well above market price; limits not going through, etc.  Finally, there are so many fees. This could just be the way crypto is as I know most brokerage firms used to charge a flat fee when trading anything. But, damn. A PERCENTAGE of the money you deposit or invest is thrown away every time. Like I said, this is my first experience with a crypto trading platform- so idk what sort of fees to expect. So I have a few questions 1. Is “BinanceUS” worth it or reputable? Important to not Im not talking about “Binance.” 2. How difficult would it be to transition to another trading platform? Am I already screwed for handing my info to BinanceUS? 3. What are some of the other trading platforms people use here? Ones that trade most/all alt coins and have decent customer service? Flat fees or reasonable fees would also be super nice. Also, is there a platform that has a portfolio tracker built in?  I’ve learned a BUNCH about crypto in the past month or so and am loving this whole environment. The more I learn, the more I understand there’s a lot I don’t know yet. This sub has been amazing for teaching me and giving insight on what actual users/traders are doing and how they’re doing it— I really appreciate it :)",4

A bear market now is just a great opportunity to buy into a foregone conclusion.  BTC, ETH, ALGO, ADA, LINK, ATOM, ZIL and a dozen more are now becoming realistic, safe medium to long term bets.

1616113137,"I make a bit of money swing/day trading while drunk sometimes, but the lesson I've learned from it is to only budget a very small amount of my portfolio into trades. Like if I have $2000 to invest I'd put $1800 into my long/medium term hodls and $200 into my trading fund. If I make some profit off trades I put those into my long term stuff and start back again with the $200. I honestly just do it out of boredom most of the time and more often then not my trading coins can become long term hodls if I end up liking the project.  That's just my two sats though, whatever is the most comfortable way of investing to you is usually the best one to stick with. Best of luck to ya, hombre",6

It's marketcap is undervalued compared to its total value locked, whereas uni is overvalued in this regard. Needs to fix it's emissions problem. VET is probably still undervalued considering the partnerships and corporate adoption, though it's performed well recently.  ETH is undervalued on the ETH/BTC ratio. Not exceeded its ATH anywhere as much as BTC. Going through a sustained cool off at the moment but it is the first mover on smart contracts and will always be the platform king.  BUNNY - the YFI of bsc, yield aggregator that you can stake to earn bnb at over 100% Apr or to auto compound on bsc farms.  LINK - Despite steady growth it's not really had it's 'moment' this run like ADA and DOT have.

To think that the 3rd largest coin by market cap, which has been pumping for 3 weeks straight, was going to explode once listed on Coinbase when it's available literally every else, and has been for months, was nothing more than pure greed by the holders. Yes, I'm talking about ADA. It's a great recent example of how this sub operates on its worst days because project merits aside, many people encouraged others to buy who are now instantly 10%-15% down (unless they sold the top in the 30-minute window they had) instead of being able to buy the bottom today which in my opinion was a much more reasonable prediction.

1616177770,youll either drive a lambo or a moped,5
1616140425,and we are off,12
1616140445,"Can you stake VET, similar to ADA?",7
1616151765,Name and shame the shitcoin,6
1616115584,Just a daily reminder of your XLM prediction of 0.45 by the end of the weekend. :D Cmon boys and girls. If you like u/arghmybrain (and who doesn’t) then you all have to do your part in making their prediction come to fruition!,8
1616151629,I hope the pokemon rumour becomes reality,5
1616175694,We've finally beat those extravert bastards!,7
1616179075,I just bought at $1.32   Planning a long term hodl (10+ years),6
1616114246,"How tho? I love tradingview but not sure how it could change my view on crypto. For me, crypto is much more than price action on a chart.",4
1616116275,"Got mine setup in time for this next distro I think. Very cool, this moon thing!",5
1616118129,The constant and stability we need,4
1616120435,It's funding the Veve NFT app which already has many partnerships with big name brands. The app is already built and functioning with a roadmap to improve the system. It's still very early so people are buying into the potential.,3
1616126346,"Matic, 1inch, Orn, Enj",6
1616126371,No one I know personally owns any crypto. There are just a \*few dabblers in the mainstream now. Lots of room to run and I don't expect a huge plunge like crypto winter. Alt season will go for a year.,6
1616135265,Timing the market is impossible. Just buy now and don't look back. If you're in it for the long haul that is. If you're looking to make a quick trade the game is obviously entirely different.,6
1616137322,5 personally. Any more feels like way to much to keep up to date with!,5
1616137321,"I hold 5, 4 in top 10 and then  1 top 20",5
1616139538,Because you are smart I'd say. Could have been also -20%.,7
1616139641,"Enjoy it every week for the next two years, also make sure to check out terra.mirror.finance and claim your weekly MIR airdrop too. Believe we have 38/9 weeks of that one :)",5
1616143006,Happy Friday to you too! :D,5
1616144713,yeap. you can take out flexible savings anytime too,4
1616146866,Ask yourself in a few years again.,5
1616147367,"solid af. check out the background of their team in their whitepaper and the VEVE app which omi is the backend for. they got a shit ton of exclusive licences for 3d AR interactive collectibles like DC, Warner (ghostbusters, back to the future) and they have NFL and star trek coming soon tokens get burnt with each app purchase too",4
1616148216,"I would say 10x this year, so 0.80",6
1616151348,Regret selling XLM? Doubt it ![gif](giphy|CoDp6NnSmItoY),13
1616151517,A little bit of ~~cheese~~ CHZ,4
1616155251,"""Feel like it could shoot up anyday"". LTC hodlers keep saying that for the last couple of months :')",6
1616155360,Had the same feeling yesterday. I imagine the day they mine the last LTC will be a fine day.,4
1616156348,"Rather the spam issue get resolved now than at higher prices, so I'm still holding some.",4
1616156225,No i got some,4
1616156508,"XLM is dead inside just like me, that's why I love the guy 😎",6
1616156579,Chill! It had already a 1% pump today,3
1616158005,Yes. It's consolidating now so expecting a big push upward today. Supply is capped and comparable to many other coins in the $20-30 range. Enjin has the most applicable NFT market as their focus: Gaming. It's still early for Enjin IMO. (Position: only 500 ENJ cause I sold like a dummy and took profits),6
1616158110,Ohh yeah and imho it will!  If the Age of Rust goes well then it will probaly go up more next week.,4
1616161217,"Always praising OMI and LTO, always pooping on XLM",5
1616165575,"Think about exercising, refresh portfolio, shitpost, realise I didn't exercise, beer. hbu?",6
1616165609,"Pizza, beer, Snyder Cut.",6
1616165649,Hopefully go for a hike with the pup if it's nice enough out,3
1616166563,Of course we are 🙂,4
1616166734,Not much to do if you are all in.,4
1616167304,He sold his crypto and moved to Svalbard.,4
1616167796,I think we need a sticky to explain to people that  Layer 2 rollups are coming out by the end of this month and gas fees will come way down. At this point I can only assume that people are deliberately spreading FUD because the news has been everywhere for weeks now.,4
1616168528,"I'd take VET over ENJ any day, but that's just me.",6
1616168706,"Lots of VET FUD surrounding the scale of decentralization. But know it's 101 validators and not something like 10. Also, because there are fixed validators we have institutions, banks, and governments are more likely to trust the VET network over other coins at this current time. That being said, I hold a shit ton of VET and am gaining free VHTO by the second.",4
1616169946,One can hope!,4
1616169666,"Isn't as flashy as others but I think it's fundamentals are sound, if fundamentals matter at all with crypto prices. I'm holding long term",7
1616176331,It's just a tribute to XLM,5
1616176852,"I like LTO, RPL and PHA",3

1616116011,"Not being funny, but to many this would be considered a sign, unironically, that the top is close. Joking aside - Personally I don't have a clue either way. But seeing as you mentioned you have gone huge into it, I suggest exercising some caution and trying to de-risk yourself by pulling profits slowly - unless you are happy to hold that money to zero for a few years (even then you'd be better off taking small amounts out now at least). Please be careful. Stock markets see crashes regularly, crypto will too - and we are in a macro bubble, perhaps we won't dip as far this time. But a bear market is coming, and the chances of timing it perfectly are nigh on impossible",9

1616156435,Welcome to the VeFamily. I suggest subbing to r/VeChain if you haven’t already.,6
1616150995,"Yes, YES!!",8
1616151235,In it for the science.,9
1616157218,Same with me. This coins should be atleast top50 in terms of marketcap,8
1616170159,Yeah these markets will screw you up faster than a NANO transaction™,8
1616179330,Xlm is also beneficial if you're into meditation as it won't disturb you.,7
1616140681,VET generates VTHO tokens so kind of yes,4
1616151842,I'm already embarrassed. It was a random token only tradable through pancakeswap.,5
1616116477,Yup you’re set to receive \~161. I’ll send you one now to get you off 0 ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|airdrop),4
1616165686,I’ll exercise if you exercise,4
1616165682,I'll go for a run with my dog soon and then probably exactly the same as you!,4
1616166586,Phew I got worried for a second there,3
1616116857,So much in agreement. If you think this is the end. literally pinch your chart and zoom and ask yourself what it means that bitcoins “plummeted” to 55k a couple times. We’re talking about bitcoin....at 55 THOUSAND dollars.,6
