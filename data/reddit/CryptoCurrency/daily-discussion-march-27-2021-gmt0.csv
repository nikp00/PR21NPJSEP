1616806428,"Now that the dip has ended, it's worth noting after all was said and done, *75,000 BTC left exchanges over the past 5 days in excess of their inflows* (according to Cryptoquant charts); or roughly 4.1 *Billion USD* worth of BTC. This means some whales and/or institutions packed their bags full to the brim, with no intention to sell in the immediate future.  This also brings the total available BTC on exchanges down to about 2.28 Million BTC, the lowest we've seen since the 2018 bull run.  (We've been trending downwards around ~3500 BTC/Day on exchanges since Jan 1) All this conspires to mean continually decreasing supply and less selling pressure, aka, further signs that prices are likely going to continue to rise through the near future.  Hope you remembered to buy the dip!",66

At that point distribution would end, but the admins devised a way through burning moons for distribution to continue beyond new issuance. Burned moons are sent to the burn address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and are temporarily removed from circulation. For each round, half of the burned moons supply is reintroduced for distribution. # When are moons burned? Moons are burned when you buy the premium membership or redeem moons for coins.

Risk management obviously important but 35% is the safe limit and I have personally just kept most the UST i borrowed on hand to repay the loan should it dip. (I have been using bLUNA). In the mean time - that money you borrow you can either put it into the anchor fixed saving protocol for 20% on your UST (flexible, low fees), or pair it with your anchor (paid out for borrowing) - and add it to the ANC-UST liquidity pool. This feels like cheating. I would stop posting about terra, but frankly I keep being impressed.  See my post history for a breakdown on anchor protocol that i posted on r/defi a few days ago.",8

He is the only person with access to 180 million USD in user funds. Nobody can get their money Investigators unravel his past, find out where he originally got the money to open the exchange and it's discovered that the guy has basically been a scammer his entire lifetime, making millions from Ponzi schemes and money laundering, all from his bedroom To cut a long story short... there's an *extremely* good chance he's still alive and is on the run with 1.8 billion dollars in cryptocurrency Absolute madness",9
