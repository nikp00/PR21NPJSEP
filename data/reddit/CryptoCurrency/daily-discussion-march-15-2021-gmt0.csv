1615832159,"We had two bags of shitcoins, seventy-five pellets of UNI , five sheets of high powered NFTs, a salt shaker half full of ETH, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored low caps, defis, food coins, meme coins... and also a quart of BNB, a quart of ADA, a case of LTC, a pint of wrapped BTC and two dozen LINK. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious shitcoin collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the XRP. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an XRP binge.

This will let people use their ATOM to setup liquidity pools to facilitate trading between different tokens, while letting liquidity providers pocket fees.   2) Enable interblockchain communication transfers. This is the main value prop of Cosmos! If you think ATOM is pumping now, just wait until massive value volumes are being transferred using the Cosmos Hub! Let's get it done!",16

(cmc: The global crypto market cap is $1.80T). So, yes I am still a Goddess! ;)  * So, the market cap has grown by approximately 150b the past week, officially ending the ~~bull~~ bear market. * BTC soar to almost 62k, starting off the week a little below 60k. * BTC has seen a small red candle the past few days. BTC mentions have seen a titan of a red candle as the gains stopped  * ETH finally found its way above 1900 again. Currently easily handling the 1800 area. * BNB went over 300 once more but the fud surrounding it made it fall back below 270. * A lot of great projects decided on a lack of positive growth. This includes xlm, atom, egld, grt, aave, ada, uni and many more. * Vet made some sweet gains the past week, though its growth is now halted. * Luna did amazing well with nearly 100% growth in the past week.  * Nano is close to falling out of the top 100, its growth impaired by spam fud, and other projects rushing past it. * Doge decided to grow again, though it's already falling down now. Still, its endurance is impressive. * XEM went down over half value!  * LTC became a grower this week against all odds. * Truly the biggest winners are the nft growth, creeping up fast into the top 100, with chz currently sitting at an impressive rank 31. NFT combines massive fud with massive fomo. * The top 5 biggest gainers of the week are chz, mana, hot, hbar and one. Making 124-413% gains. * The top 5 biggest losers of the week are ehmm, well, a bunch at 10% losses and champion loset XEM losing over half its value. Oh boy, that doesn't happen often for established top 100 coins! To reiterate... LOSER! * Nearly half the top 100 crypto currencies made losses over the week despite the amazing bull market.  * It's truly a week of unknown coins being shilled to the max. * Coin mention diversity has significantly grown.  * Over the past 24 hours hot, hbar and one have seen some sweeeet gains. Both in mentions and actual value growth.  * This week's mental image is attacking bulls made out of pure chaos, with many alts trying to climb its back but most failing and being trampled.",106

It was called timechain. When and why it was changed to blockchain I don't know but if anyone does please do elaborate. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.,7
