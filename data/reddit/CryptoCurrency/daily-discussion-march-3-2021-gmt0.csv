1614812137,"Let's talk about ETH for a minute. ETH/BTC has been in a rising channel the last few months and its currently right at the bottom of that channel. ETH/BTC RSI is verging on oversold and is currently hovering around a region where it has bounced multiple times previously. The last time BTC made a new all time high then fell below the 20 day moving average, then broke back above it, eth proceeded to go on a facemelting run to a new all time high.  Perceived bitcoin stability is GREAT for ETH. BTC is probably not going to break all time high within the next few weeks, but it's also probably not going to dump significantly either. I do believe the stars are aligning and we're gearing up for a run to $2.5-$3K in the coming weeks.",15

1614808268,"My price target for ATOM ⚛️ is $160. Yes, you heard that right. ***$160***.  My PT analysis is based on a comparison of ATOM to it's main competitor, DOT. Both want to achieve an internet of blockchains by creating an interblockchain communication protocol.  DOT's market cap (33bn) is currently over 6 times larger than ATOM's market cap (~5bn). This is despite Cosmos's ATOM: 1) **Having a working product.** ATOM deployed interblockchain communication a couple weeks ago. Polkadot still doesn't have a launch date on theirs.  2) **The market cap of chains *already* using ATOM is higher than DOT's**. This trend is likely to continue as well, DOT removes blockchain sovereignty by forcing chains to use their shared security model. Larger chains like Binance chain (currently using ATOM) will never surrender sovereignty over their own chain. Btw, this is also why China is using Cosmos instead of Polkadot. ATOM's model allows chains to secure themselves, and soon, ATOM will be giving the option for chains to rent security from ATOM if they'd like as well. 3) **ATOM has near term catalysts that will allow for additional spikes in price.** They will be deploying an automated market maker as well as an ability for other chains to ""rent"" validators from the Cosmos Hub. Both are being deployed in the next couple months. ATOM holders will get a cut of fees related to the market maker and rented security.  **Summary: There is no reason for DOT to be this far ahead of ATOM in market cap. At a minimum, the two should be valued competitively. This means that ATOM could 6X in value before approaching parity with DOT. **",23

1614809746,"This might be a longshot, but I'm curious if anyone can answer some technicals on how Cross-Chain DeFi markets work.  Ex. Sushiswap trading ETH for FTM. Obviously within ETH/same chain it's easy enough to just have a smart contract swap things either via atomic swaps or an escrow account. For cross-chain stuff though, do they basically run an oracle and escrow per-chain to verify the funds are valid from both ends, then swap things from the liquidity pools after in a second transaction?  I'm not sure how else you could do it without at least using two different blocks for validation given you're looking at two distinct chains with different block/transaction validations times, protocols, etc. I suppose the other option is they just wrap all assets onto their home network and do on-chain trading from there, then unwrap the assets after? Though functionally that's pretty similar under the hood, and still requires multiple transactions for assets that aren't already wrapped.",6

1614769528,Many people seem to think they will buy alts and bitcoin again at cheap prices in the next bear market. There is a strong possibility that we are not going to get a bear market like the previous ones. Altcoin USD prices depend strongly on Bitcoin/USD and as the leader of the market BTC is attracting massive institutional attention and also facing unprecedented supply crunch right now.  Expensive prices on Bitcoin are likely to stay and that would mean another 95% correction on your fav alts could also be a thing of the past. Sure there will be corrections but they may not be like the 2018-19 bear market.  If market cycles were so predictable then there would be no fun. I strongly believe we are in a super cycle of sorts with Bitcoin where it goes from obscure speculative asset to a portion in every portfolio. Along with institutions we are already seeing Citi group turning positive on BTC. These are powerful financial groups for whom govts part seas to keep them afloat.,9

KuCoin is technically also not supposed to be used, which is why I don't want to store my stuff on there long term. I want to do the trade, and then transfer it to a safe wallet.
