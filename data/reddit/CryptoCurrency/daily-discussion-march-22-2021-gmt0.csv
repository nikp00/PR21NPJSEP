So I bought DENT 3+ years ago. Seemed like a decent project. Turns out the coin was essentially a scam to fund the developer's phone data company, with the coin literally having no use within the ecosystem. Ends up plummeting down to 0.001c and staying there indefinitely. Without any rhyme or reason it managed to get to 0.004 two days ago and I think ""fuck it, I've held this dead bag long enough, the developer's will just dump all their coins any minute now like they always do to keep the price next to worthless"". Sell at a massive loss but at least I managed to recover some money, right? But no. Of course this is the ONE time the value just keeps climbing and is now nearly at 1c.

All that time being glued to our phones thinking if we stare at the screen hard enough, a green candle will print on the 5 minute, leading to a 10x gain the same day. It‚Äôs the truth. That‚Äôs why these daily discussions are always so active. Because when we see the slightest change in percent, we come here commenting ‚ÄúLTO/Vechain/One/Eth to the moon‚Äù or ‚ÄúXLM at 41 cents!‚Äù or now with people talking about the dip is over because a wild green stick appears.
