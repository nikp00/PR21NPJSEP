1617499368,"I keep seeing the term ""DCA"" thrown around a lot. Usually people will say ""im going to DCA when the price dips."" or ""now is the perfect time to DCA since the price is low."" Correct me if i am wrong, but isn't that the same thing as timing the market and not really DCA-ing? Or am i missing something? I thought dollar cost averaging meant investing a fixed amount on a consistent timely basis to combat volatility. For example, buying $20 of BTC every night at 10pm regardless of price. That way in the long term it follows a normal (gaussian) distribution in terms of the prices you buy at. Can someone help explain/clarify? Edit: wow wasn't expecting a gold award, thank you so much! And thank you for all your feedback!",50

1617507316,"I used to work in finance but found my way to education with a finance background, which is a much better fit. I was a small player in crypto 2017-2018, mostly watching shitcoins elevate and crash, seeing the volatility across the spectrum. During the pandemic, and with a lot more research, I became considerably more invested. Over time, my top four coins became BTC ETH BNB and ATOM (by the way, I still consider these the top four) I started to get a whiff of the NFTs early in the year, and as they heated up, I pulled percentages of my four major coins to ENJ, OGN, and (a tad late) CHZ. I aggressively changed a fairly conservative portfolio to chase.  It was a big success. And even though I believe in all three projects in the great future, I pulled out of everything other than ENJ, in which I also removed my initial investment.  I had a load of fiat, a swelled chest, and a massive and growing belief in the April that could be for BNB. For reasons I’ve oft posted. And knowing my ability to occasionally second guess myself, or to choose a more conservative route, one night I staked all of it into BNB. I’m sure many of you have been annoyed by my posts about my belief in this coming burn, and the massive potential for growth for BNB. I have won with this gamble so far. But honestly, staking such a massive percentage was not in my character, and has been stressful enough that I deem it a mistake. I had this big chunk that for the moment I considered sort of play money, and so I decided I would let it ride on something I really believed would go big. And I really hope it does, and my heart beats fast hoping it will. But, in this moment, whether I win or lose, I’m telling you, I should have played it much more safely. I am over invested in one coin. And watching everything dip today did not feel good.  I will officially stop shilling BNB. But, please, even when things are going great, exercise the sort of caution you know crypto demands. My nerves are a little too rattled having so much tied up in one spot. Wish me well and I promise to wish you the same. And stick to your strategy, with minor tweaks, not major tweaks. The stress is real.",22
1617496655,"New daily! Didn't notice it's already time for it!!! The green of the past few days didn't hold. :( * The daily thread didn't even reach 12k comments.

That's like 7 markets of XLM! * Loser bitcoin fell below 58k. * Loser ethereum fell below 2100, but stayed above 2k!! * Loser BNB fell below 330. * Loser UNI fell below 30, LINK did the same. * ADA did nothing. We're used to that by now. * LTC fell below 200 again. Kinda feel bad for LTC. :( * While most coins went red, FIL decided to climb and is up 8%. * XLM stayed above 40 cents! 42 cents, not bad chap, not bad. * BTT, one of the most shilled coins lately, gained... * AAVE didn't stay above 400, but ATOM did stay above 20.  * NANO lost all gains it made. * FTM went under 40 cents again. I don't like this. *angrily looks at my bag and kicks it* * No coins have seen a specifically large amount of shilling today.  * HRT is the biggest gainer with 26%, followed by SOL with 18% and... *pukes* TRX with 13% * The biggest losers have a wider selection. SC down 13%, ZRX down 11%, 5 others down 10%. * Outside into the top 500 the picture shows more red and larger green. * WIN made an impressive 87% gains and seems to want to move towards the top 100. That would make 3 Justin Sun coins in the top 100. LBC with 75% TITAN with 74%, APL with 68% and NKN with 56% are the top 500 gainers above 50%. * Losses were made too. DAC with 26% TT with 22%, PIB with 21% are the biggest losers of the day.

But eventually the better ones seperated themselves from the pack and the weaker ones failed completely. Do we still have a long way to go before each coins value is more based on its individual merrit rather than just movement of the entire crypto market? Obviously a rising tide will always raise all boats and everyone will struggle in a bear market but right now it is very extreme. For example if some random shitcoin failed it would probably hurt the value of ETH even if that coin had absolutely nothing to do with ETH and they didn't have similar properties.( Not looking to discuss the quality of any individual coin or ETH, just using it as an example)",4

1617575532,"Definitely feeling a bit of mania in the air with all the ""Alt Season!!!"" hype and pyramid coins like safemoon going nuts. I think we're still off a bit from the point of maximum euphoria, but it's always something to keep an eye on.  'Get rich quick' schemes doing well is a *bad* sign for the markets, just like the ICO hype from 2018.  Crypto already posts an average of 2-3x+ yearly returns, which is *insanely* profitable.  People greeding for 10x in a week to the extent they won't even research their coins at all should make you pause for a bit and be more critical of your investments. Hell, we have a lot of posts here hunting for what coins haven't pumped yet, purely on the logic that everything *will* get a pump, so they just have to get in before it happens.  Just pause and consider how ridiculous that logic sounds when you step back a bit.",11

1617499713,"You are right, the moment you change the time based on any logic other than fixed interval, it is not DCA then. It is trading.",19
1617499997,Yes you are correct. DCA-ing when the market drops is literally timing the market. The best thing to do is to DCA on fixed intervals (every month for example) and have a separate little fund for major dips (15-20% or more). Have been doing it for 5+ years and works like a charm. It's a combination between DCA and light market timing.,10
1617499516,"No need to explain or clarify, you got it all completely correct. Timing your ""DCA"" is still just timing the market. The beauty of DCA is to trust the power of averaging.",10
