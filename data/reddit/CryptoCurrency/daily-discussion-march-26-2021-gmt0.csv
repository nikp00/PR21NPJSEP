1616719227," A painful day for many. After a painful day the other day.  * The market cap dipped under 1.6t, now sitting at 1.63t, not far below what yesterday ended at.  * BTC dipped under 51k, currently barely above 52k. * ETH went under 1.6k but did manage to get above that again. * XLM crashed all the way down to 35 cents, now sitting at 37 cents. Bad stablecoin! * LTC at a sad 170.  * ADA suddenly spiked. Or that's what ADA fans imagined when ADA showed a miniature green dildo for a second. * AAVE barely saved itself from going under 300. * NANO is feeling super relaxed sitting at 4.20. * Beyond the crash, the most talked about coin is recently distribute moons. Its price potential talk far outside of its lack of function or potential.  * Today's winners are any coin that gained some. But ANKR with 34% the clear biggest gainer. Apparently due to a coinbase listing, as I just read before posting this. Thanks /u/Spacedude2187 !  * The biggest loser ended up DGB with 7%. * Looking into the top 500 there's a clear distinction in bigger winners and bigger losers.  * The biggest gainer is totally legit 5.4m% gainer NBR. RNDR with 45% a distant second.  * MUSH losing over half its value. GRN losing 42%. * Today's mental image is a very relaxed session of a screaming therapy.",68
