1615222679,I‚Äôm back in school trying to finish my associates in engineering before I transfer to go for a bachelors in aerospace. My grades are pretty good. It‚Äôs spring break. I turn 30 in 3 days. I‚Äôm only down $25 across my portfolio. Things are going okay. 2 years ago I was addicted to heroin. No job. No future. No money. Hopeless. Things can work out if you make a plan and stick to it. But I‚Äôve had a lot of help along the way. My family and my wife and a lot of counselors and doctors. I‚Äôm just happy to be here. Just thought I‚Äôd share some of my story with you folks.,24

1615185844,"How to be a crypto youtuber:  1)make a clickbait thumbnail with a blown up, exaggerated version of your face. Add in a few crying eyes emojis for good measure.  2) make the video at least 10 minutes long so you can maximize ad revenue. Make sure to waste half the time rambling on about nothing and telling your viewers to ""smash"" that subscribe button. Add in sponsored content for good measure. 3) make sure to say ""this is not financial advice"" at the start of every video. Then proceed to give financial advice while shilling your bags for the next 10 minutes. 4) Make outrageous price pridictions in every video. Eg XRP is going to $270 per coin. Never mind that at that price, it will have a market cap of more than the entire world's assets put together. People are only clicking your video because they only want you to tell them what they want to hear. 5) research a low cap alt coin to shill. Include as many technical terms like ""sharding"" ""interoperability"" ""scalable"". But make sure you fill your own bags first so you can dump on your subscribers.",16
