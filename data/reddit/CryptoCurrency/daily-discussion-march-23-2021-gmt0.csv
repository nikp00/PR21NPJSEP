1616457675,What are people's thoughts on the new r/cryptocurrency special membership change? Good for newcomers? Money grab? This is what I wrote on the pinned post before it got locked and had all the comments removed: > Shouldn’t this have been put up to a vote? $5 is relatively cheap for shills and pump and dumpers when they stand to gain so much more.,35
1616458534,"So we are going to have a proposal to veto that mod change to posting requirements right? (stickied - and locked). Mods can vote against it if they please, just buy the voting dip and show your displeasure at the precedent set by this kind of decision making, in a supposedly community driven, semi-decentralised governance forum My thoughts on it: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ma9qe7/daily_discussion_march_22_2021_gmt0/grue0l7/",36

1616475761,"The biggest issue I have with the pinned post is that all it does is show that MOONs have no actual value in governance, as they just willy nilly did that without there being an actual proposal and vote. It's blatantly an attempt to monetize the subreddit. The mods already get something like 20% of the MOON distribution.  It also seems like it won't stop bots/shilling at all, a shill isn't going to be put off from spending $5 to buy a membership for their bot/shill account to make it look more real Money corrupts all I guess",32

Exceeded BCH to become top12.  Through data analysis, the team has money to control the market and is sought after by Koreans, which may be the core reasons. **FYI，theta just became top10 crypto, exceeded chainlink.** Theta’s core advisor is youtube co-founder Steve Chen, with sufficient funds. Top 10 holds 61% of the currency, which may be easy to manipulate the market. The new version of Theta will be launched in the near future and keep up with the NFT boom. **Some Theta's investors and advisors have a poor reputation in China, but it is irrationally sought after in South Korea.** According to CMC data, the trading volume of Theta/KRW on Bithumb, the leading exchange in South Korea, ranks fourth.

1616540849,"I see a lot of Theta FUD.  Here is what you’re missing as to why this has stealthed into the Top 10 and why in a market of speculation and bullshit it offers way more than most.   1. The entire supply is in circulation 2. The token is staked/used to operate a node as part of a backend for streaming video systems.  Theta TV is not the end product it is a demo version of the system they will provide to other established companies. 3. Their system is patented 4. It runs on a two token system. Stakers earn TFuel (another top 100 token). This means the Theta token is not subject to inflation and yet produces a yield for holders.   5. tFuel has a use case: it is earned by those providing content and viewing streams on the platform.  It is earned through staking on nodes.  It can be used to run a low tier node on the system to earn more tfuel.  6. They have a legit team and advisors include YouTube and twitch co founders. 7. They have real partnerships with household names including Sony, google, Amazon, Samsung, to name just some.   8. For some reason those in Korea seem to realise this thing has potential whereas it is a sleeper in the west (where most of this subreddit live) 9. There is a mainnet v3 release in 4 weeks and like all coins in a run up to a mainnet, it’s pumping.  Hopefully this will encourage some of you to go and look into it before palming it off as crap because you didn’t spot it and you don’t understand the project.  Unlike half the top 10 I’d say Theta warrants a place there. I mean damn it actually has a working patented product with a use case and a fully circulating supply.  It’s delivering, which is more than can be said for a hell of a lot of the totally speculative crud that gets shilled in here on an average day. EDIT: typos. EDIT: I’m not saying this won’t dump hard when bull run ends but I do expect it to pop back up. EDIT: I’m not saying go buy it after it’s meteroic trend upward and this is not financial advice -  DYOR and make your own investing decisions",14
1616496122,"**TL:DR** \- Monthly proposals have just become a battlefield for people to maximise the number of MOONS they can get. Only three proposals looked to improve the state of the subreddit: Posted as a thread as requested! \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **The proposals** This month there are 10 proposals that are listed and I just wanted to try understand how users interact with them. 1/ Limit of two free posts a week: Aims to restrict the amount of MOONS a user can earn. 56% of MOONS are against this which comprises 54% of individual voters 2/ Reduced karma from news links: Aims to restrict the amount of MOONS a user can earn. 66% of MOONS are against this which comprises 29% of individual voters 3/ Personal story flair: Aims to restrict the amount of MOONS a user can earn. 65% of MOONS are against this which comprises 29% of individual voters 4/ Tipping allowance: Aims to promote gifting (without impacting MOONS). 87% of MOONS are for this which comprises 84% of individual voters 5/ Bonus moons for voting: Aims to promote voting. 95% of MOONS are for this which comprises 85% of individual voters 6/ Reduce membership fee: Reduce membership fee by ten-fold. 55% of MOONS are against this which comprises 25% of individual voters 7/ Reward members with bonus: Incentivise membership with additional MOONS. 54% of MOONS are for which comprises 44% of individual voters 8/ Reward quality posts: Incentivises high quality posts at the expense of low quality posts. 90% of MOONS are against which comprises 50% of individual voters 9/ Restrict eligible comments: Aims to restrict the amount of MOONS a user can earn by only counting an arbitrary number of comments. 79% of MOONS are against which comprises 54% of individual voters 10/ Negate downvote effects: Aims to improve MOONS amount for a user. 83% of MOONS are against this which comprises 55% of individual voters \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Types of proposals** Subjectively speaking - only Proposal 4, Proposal 5 & Proposal 8 look to improve the actual state of the subreddit. \- Ensuring people do not feel compromised by tipping will improve the community spirit within the subreddit; \- Incentivising voting will directly improve the health in ensuring that people's views are taken on board; and \- Rewarding quality posts is a better way to have a better subreddit as opposed to taxing low quality posts. The former will have people generate better content, the latter will leave an empty subreddit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Concerns of our voting system** My biggest concern is that although all MOON holders should vote in their best interests, big MOON holders (potentially including Moderators, unsure if they are allowed to vote on proposals) sway any proposal significantly to the extent that they are immediately unviable even though the majority of voting population are positive towards it. I direct you towards Proposal 2, Proposal 3, Proposal 6 & Proposal 8 where large MOON holders overwhelm the voting and make any proposal improbable. When MOONS were released, it was stated we were able to be democratic in our ways. Each individual MOON is not a voter, each individual person is a voter. Like traditional politics, we can restrict our voter population if you wish (minimum karma amount, minimum age) but this is just pure capitalism. This can create a model even worse than traditional politics, imagine the people in your country would vote with their net worth? Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos vote on an agenda that suits them, the rest of the country might as well go back to sleep. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Potential solution** \- Proposals are still voted on a MOONS basis so that a proposal is only passed if there is a simple majority in MOONS above the minimum threshold \- Should a supermajority in individual voters (potentially 67% of people) vote for a change to the status quo, a simple majority in MOON votes is no longer required (potentially 35% - 40% required) \- If required, we can create anti-alt measures such as a requirement to have contributed to the subreddit for one period (i.e. even if they have been making negative karma requirements, as long as they have been in the subreddit for one month they can vote). All the numbers in my solution are arbitrary and could be flexed to create a better solution. If we were to have this current solution in place (and the current proposals were to achieve minimum voting threshold): \- Proposal 2 & Proposal 3 would be extremely close to passing (with between 34% and 35% of votes and a supermajority) which would mean that with some tailoring we would be able to re-propose this and pass it next month; \- Proposal 6 would pass as it has a supermajority in voting population and a MOONS voting of above the adjusted threshold; and \- Proposal 8 would not be impacted by this as although it is swayed largely by large MOON holders, it does not achieve a supermajority in voting population. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ If you made it this far, I humbly thank you for reading my ramblings and if you have any thoughts - I would really appreciate them to see if we should take this further!",12

But if they actually get that - then what the fuck.

1616512514,"Sometimes, the blood of the willing, is donated to the pool of the everliving. If I do anything new, I always do a test amount.  In the case of ETH moves, that gets expensive, BUT, I'd rather lose $5 + $20 in fees, over $5000 + $20 in fees.",4

1616528219,"Of those, ATOM/LINK if you're talking for at least a year+. LINK continues to seem like it has a strong stranglehold on the oracles market, with no sign of that easing up.  (Honestly the only way I can see it happening is if a non-solidity supporting network ends up blowing up with their own Oracles platform getting established before LINK can pivot onto their network) ATOM has had multiple SDK-based chains hit the top 20(CRO/LUNA/BSC) in the past few months, with more major ones on the way, and a ton of main-chain updates still slated this year. MATIC while neat, probably will hurt after ETH 2.0 release if it makes the subnet kind of irrelevant, and it's still yet to catch on yet as the main L2 solution for ETH 1.x. ALGO/ADA are a little more moon-shot-y.  They could blow up, or they could fizzle out/never really become truly relevant market players in terms of dApps/etc.  I don't really feel like the cards are coming up ADA/ALGO at this juncture, given the way the dApp scene has been moving recently.  (Everyone wants Web3 Support, Solidity/ETH dApp support, ETH/BSC Bridges, and/or Cosmos IBC compatibility.  These two are 0/4 on those features currently.)",6
