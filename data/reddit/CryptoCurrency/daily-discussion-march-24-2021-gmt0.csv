1616545441,"It's Wednesday and we're swimming in red! Or are we? * The day started off red, went green, then went red again. The market cap staying pretty stable. * The top 100 is seeing mostly red with some spots of green. * While the daily reached 10k the other day, we now see one below 10k again. People sad. * BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB are all just sleeping the day away. * THETA, however, climbed further and is now sitting in the top 10. * THETA's fuel also gained big, with 20% going against the red, now sitting at rank 40. * LTC has been downed to rank 10 and it's now going to be a battle between LTC and LINK for that coveted 10! (unless Theta shits its pants and crashes) * XRP has fallen down some. * XLM ends the day below 40 cents.  Nobody is truly surprised. * Dogecoin climbs a rank spot and sits at 16 again. * LUNA has fallen quite a bit down below 17! * VET's gains also didn't hold, now nearing 8 cents instead of the oft mentioned 10 cents. * VET's little one, VTHO, fell out of the top 100. * Surprisingly, against all odds, IOTA actually gained over 12%. Still far off from its ATH, fans are no doubt happy. * An even bigger surprise, CAKE gained a few percent. * ETC is again outshining big boy ETH. (though only for a little) * ONE gained again after a short tumble yesterday, wanting that 20 cents I think. * BTMX is in the top 100 and I have no idea what it is and how it got there or how long it's been there. * NANO is barely in the top 100. It doesn't seem to put up much of a fight. * LTO moved into the top 200, how long until top 100? Literally nobody knows! * Over the past day, the top 100 biggest gainers are ANKR with 40%, THETA with 26% and BTMX with 23% * The biggest top 100 losers was none other than LUNA with a big 18% lost! * Looking into the top 500, we see STORJ has gained 87% and is aiming for that top 100 spot! ONOT has gained a massive 225% but is a loser with no volume. DCN gained 89% but with under 2m volume isn't looking to hold it. * QQQ lost a whole 31%, making it the top 500 biggest loser and we should all make fun of him. * Today's mental image is one of those tampon commercials where the woman is looking all disgusted but nothing significant actually happened.",155

Imagine once further exchanges list it and that 45M is further split up. I've been saying it for a while, this token has all the makings for a supply squeeze.

The BTC network consumes 20 x more than Facebook's data centers and more than 10 x that of Google. Where I live argument is from the crypto proponents is that the power used by bitcoin miners would otherwise be exported to other countries. The counter argument of course would be that it's better for the planet to export clean energy to other countries than to consume it on mining.  I'm playing a bit of a devil's advocate here but I haven't yet found killer arguments against the environmental impact BTC mining comes with.,5

By mid-May we will be able to scale up to multiple drops in a week. Then by end of Q2 and Q3 our objective is to enable anyone to use the NFT launchpad in a self-serve way. **Imagine Shopify for NFTs**.

You'd have to have an insane amount of money in to become rich, whereas I think a lot of people fantasize about the cheap altcoins going to BTC's price. If that happened you could pretty easily become a multimillionaire! It's high risk in that the vast majority of altcoins fail, but you also don't have to invest much money in them.
