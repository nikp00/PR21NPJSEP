1615593726,"What a difference a year makes.  365 days ago, a majority of people thought Bitcoin was on the brink. I won‚Äôt lie, I was beginning to sweat as well. The crypto doomsday clock appeared to be approaching midnight.  Flash forward 12 months. The daily Bitcoin moves are greater than an entire coin was worth back then. Hedge funds and wealthy elites are snatching up all they can, and the average Joe‚Äôs are scrambling for the rest. The days are back wherein this sub is a megaphone of optimism and euphoria permeates the comments.  If this much change was possible over the last year, imagine what could be in store for the next year.  Disclaimer: I‚Äôve had a few drinks, am in a good mood, and am loving seeing all the good vibe and feel good posts come back. I‚Äôll have one more for all of you... enjoy your gains in the months ahead and have a good night.",53

1615595027,"Let's do this again! * The past day has seen a massive collapse of the crypto market of an entire 1.3%. * Most alts actually down a lot more than 1.3%. * The biggest news is The Binance vs The Establisment. /r/cc isn't sure who to root for. * While Bitcoin teased us with a new ATH yesterday, today it's just mocking about. * ETH is basically dead having gone down an entire 3.7%. Crypto fanatics are screaming bloody murder. * News of ETH2 coming early is spreading slowly. Early without actual date attached, so... meh. * ETH miners are rebelling. * The day before, BNB disappointed us all with a tweet. The past day, they fudded us all with investigation news. Down a whole 10%. (Please rise bby, my bag needs you to rise!) * CAKE and BAKE followed big brother BNB down into the abyss. * ADA fell some more and might just end up below 1. Hah, ADA is such a n00b. * Litecoin went against the majority and its history and actually gained today. People that fudded out the day before are now fomoing back in. * XLM isn't sure what it wants except that it doesn't want to grow up. ATOM decides to follow stablecousin XLM. * CHZ is again making waves, gaining over 100% and making sports fans all over the world big bucks. Almost having risen into the top 20! * VET actually fell instead of grew the past day. VET fans are not complaining. This makes VET fans better than other cryptocurrency fans. * NEM had an airdrop. The airdrop did not go as expected and the plane crashed. * Another big wave maker has turned out to be ONE. No, not NEO, Harmony!  * HOGE is still a big name in the daily and is bound to make lots of people great losses. * Lots of talk about MANA going on, but nobody talks about what MANA is. lrn2shill * The 3 biggest top 100 gainers of the day turned out to be CHZ (Ugh, stop doing that, give another the spotlight!), ONE and LUNA. * The 3 biggest top 100 losers of the day are NEM, recent gainer champion FTM and CAKE. * Today's mental image is a horde of random unknown alts climbing all over the big king to stand atop its crown and shout out to the losers in the pits below just how awesome they are.",129

1615631611,Haven't seen a new ATH in almost a month! Felt like years,5
1615631664,Could someone explain a couple things I don‚Äôt really understand. It‚Äôs mostly the difference between crypto buying/trading in America or Europe. 1. I see a lot of posts where people complain about having to pay like $50 to buy $100 worth of a coin. Do Americans not have something like bitvavo where u just have to pay 0.15% fees for every trade?  2. People in America use a lot of apps like CashApp of venmo to send money to friends or family etc. Or they get real excited about something like Nano because of the zero fees if they want to send the money in crypto instead of fiat. Are u not able to send money free and instantly just using your banks?  3. When I want to sent my ETH I have on bitvavo to my own wallet I have to pay a standard fee of something like 0.001 ETH. How is it possible I always have to pay the same fee for that transfer while I see people freaking out about high gas prices?    Thank you for your time.,4
