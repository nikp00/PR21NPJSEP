1616269475,"Some info about VET (in case you missed it): ""VeChain (VET) is quickly emerging as one of the hottest crypto assets by providing blockchain capabilities for the global supply chain. Its work with BMW, Walmart China, Deloitte (one of the Big Four accounting firms), Penfolds, (one of Australia‚Äôs oldest wineries), Bayer AG (the Big Pharma company),  DNV-GL ( an international accredited registrar and classification society)  and PwC ( **PricewaterhouseCoopers - biggest audit company in the world** ) has shown that big names are willing to trust VeChain‚Äôs technology to help them take advantage of the blockchain revolution. VeChain uses a two token model. VeChain (VET) is used as a payment method  in the VeChain ecosystem and allows stakers to earn VeThor (VTHO). Users use VTHO to pay transaction costs, such as sending VeChain-based tokens or sending data to a smart contract (self-executing, computer-coded contracts that automate many business activities) "" Cheers, mates!",22

1616227861,"Bit of a moany comment, but i feel it needs to be said again - especially for new people. If you read this sub and get excited by coins that have just gone up a few hundred % that people are shouting about and posting rockets - you really, really would be good to not invest right now. I don't care about the 'use case', it being undervalued, or them giving a long term price prediction - sometimes you will be fine jumping on the bandwagon. But 8-9/10 you will end up holding that bag for a while. You may not lose money, but you end up watching it crab for a month or more whilst other things explode. At that point you are left wondering if you should sell and move to something else - of course just to repeat the process over and over again. It really doesn't matter how good the project is, they all consolidate, all go through cycles and please ignore price predictions - they are made and picked out of thin air (myself included when people push me to try and guess one) For reference: - you may have bought ATOM at 25 last month and been frustrated waiting - you may have bought AAVE at 5-600 two months ago - BNB at 330 a month ago - ADA now at 1.4 - XLM at 0.35-0.4 a few months ago - NANO at 4-5 in january The list goes on and on and it does not discredit the projects in any way shape or form. But it is a great way to not make much money during bull run (at least in opportunity cost terms).  Patience rewards people, and whilst there is no harm in trading for a few sshort term profits on hypes with a strategy to get out - be aware of what you are doing or you will be left holding stuff. In general terms - lots of people are holding defi from january - snx, aave, mkr, compound etc and lots of new people may end up holding nfts in the future. I can't predict the future and can't say that it isn't possible to continue to ride a profit wave (it is hard to know far through it you are when it is happening), but the odds are not in your favour and the risk to reward ratio is way, way off.  Buy floors, not tops. Sorry for the rant, it jjust seems it has gotten OTT again on the whole ' you can't afford to miss this one', it is sooo 'undervalued' (hint the reason it is rising lots is because it was undervalued, it probably no longer is)",55

1616215993,"I went to my local bank today, a small local bank with like 4 locations, to withdraw some cash and had an interesting interaction with the teller that was both frustrating and gave me some perspective on Defi.   I've been banking there for about 15 years now.  It's a locally own bank that started pretty much when this town was founded.  There are many other small locally owned banks, and of course there's BofA, First Community, and US bank.  I ended up choosing this business as a result of despising US Banks ""you're a poor person"" fees and BofA garbage website (at the time, don't know/care if its changed).     We use our CC for all of our purchases and any recurring payments.  We get back about $1,500 a year by doing this thanks to all the cash back rewards.  But in doing so, we rack up a heck of a monthly balance.  We pay it off every month in full and pay no interest as a result.  However, some months require me to drive all the way to the bank, withdraw cash, drive the cash to Wal-Mart, and pay the bill in cash to settle the bill instantly before its late.  All of these steps because of when pay periods hit my bank account and how long it takes for a payment to the CC to post.  I've had issues in the past where my paycheck is posted the same day I need the auto draft to go to the CC and since sometimes it takes 48 hours for payments to post I've ended up being charged late fees.  That's how I ended up adopting transporting my funds like I'm working for Garda.   So today I went to the bank to withdraw about 6k from my checking account to pay the CC.  I sat at the drive through for about 10 minutes before the teller finally asked me ""are you going to use these funds to purchase a car?"".  I was kind of confused and said no.  She looked over to the other teller and they exchanged words for almost 2 minutes and she came back over the speaker and said ""so are you um..."" and I cut her off and said I was paying a bill.  It really struck a nerve with me.  I've never had to explain why I want my money, it's none of their business.  I am usually the kind of person that doesn't care that my CC co knows my purchase history and I don't care about FB and google etc. having all my online info because it's the price I pay for getting cash back rewards or using some companies ""free"" service.  But for a second there I thought my money and my immediate access to it had conditions attached.   I have been very late to the crypto space, like within the last 2 months, but I am beginning to see that the core of what Defi is trying to solve feels more tangible than just ""crypto only goes up"".    Sorry for the rant about what probably amounts to me over reacting.  It's just that all this crypto stuff seems so obscure and there is so much information to process to even attempt to understand this.  It has only been till recently that I have begun to interact with it on exchanges and moving it around to come to find out that I hope it becomes as disruptive as it promises to be.",29

And they will expand product suite and implement a dex-aggregator for trading/swapping soon. It seems undervalued compared to other yield aggregators.

It's barely moving an inch! * The market cap has lowered a tiny bit since the day before. * BTC and ETH are now sleeping giants. * Most of the market hasn't done much, leaving us bored. * Boredom has been clearly shown with the daily barely hitting 10k. * The biggest news of the day is the coin I wasn't shilling the day before, moving from sub2k to rank 50 on coingecko. CMC decided it's still only a sub2k coin. Well done, OMI! You broke CMC!  * UNI decided to actully do something so we have a little excitement in the top 10, growing by 10% * FIL growing despite the very bearish circumstances.  * DOGE is down to 17! * AVAX has grown by over 10%. This is a rare occurance. AVAX fans so used to no movement that they've gone silent. * BTT is riding the bull into the sunset, but yet there's little talk about it. Over 70% gained in a day! * STMX has been often shouted about the past day. Gaining a whole 60%, looking to enter the top 100 soon. * Though STMX has the spotlight, PUNDI X gains 75% in a day. * NANO only has 41m between their position and leaving the top 100. * The top 100's biggest gainers of the day are clearly BTT and PUNDI X with both over 70% gains. HNT is a far distant third with 20% gains. * The biggest losers of the week are NFTs. They've lost their ability to sprint, now quickly running out of breath. * Moving out to the top 500, the biggest gainer of the day is AMO with 110% added. The biggest mover of the week is KARMA with 2900% gains (but a volume of under 1k, losers). * Today's mental image is mainly WTF OMI WTF YOU DOING? YOU BREAKING CRYPTO!

1616215059,"This is great advice in terms of a learning experience, but I think this needs to be stressed: **set a limit and stick to it**.  You might feel comfortable risking $100 dollars by day trading. You might get lucky and after a week that $100 has become $120, $150, maybe even $200 if you have a horseshoe up your ass.  Now you might be thinking, ""Wow, I'm amazing at this, time to put in more money."" So you put in $1000. That week the luck is not in your favour, and you lose that $1000 just as easily as you made your profits last week. Basically what I'm trying to say is don't get greedy, don't be blinded by the idea of profits.",11
