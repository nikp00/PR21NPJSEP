1616283511,"Mandala exchange token MDX Moonshot MDX for moonshot - 2nd chance BNB MDX is a no brainer, here’s why… MDX is the native token to Mandala Exchange, just like BNB is native to Binance Mandala just launched an exchange on Binance Cloud in late December 2020 and their token, MDX, scarily mirrors BNB’s path. The kicker is, Binance has helped build the Mandala Exchange and MDX functionality! That’s right Mandala Exchange is 100% built by Binance. Mandala and Binance share the same order books (264+ assets live for a total of 946+ pairs to trade with, and counting)  and MDX will get you the same fee discounts as BNB, which means you can get 50% discount on fees if you buy $1.4M of BNB, or you can get the same discount for the same order books on Mandala if you buy and lock $15K of MDX!!  That’s about 1/100th of the price.  And Mandala has already stated they plan to adjust the discount tiers as MDX price increase, which will give it even more room to appreciate.   Mandala already has an operational platform, which makes this an easy Moonshot.  Futures trading for the same pairs on Binance will be launching this quarter and margin trading will launch shortly thereafter,  along  with Mandala's own listing of unique top Altcoins which will actually give Mandala more tokens than Binance.  Combine this with Mandala's extremely low fees and you have a one-stop exchange for the hottest project on the markets. Here is a breakdown of the logic (math updated on Feb 17, 2021) for the HUGE intrinsic value of the Mandal token : If I hold 320k MDX as a `TAKER` I pay 0.05% in fees on Mandala.Exchange. This the equivalent of holding 9,000 BNB & 80,000 BTC in 30d Volume in Binance’s VIP 8 tier. These are the same spot rates, liquidity, and orderbooks as Binance That arithmetic presents a `material trading fee schedule delta`. Here's my math: ``` + 320,000 MDX USD Value = $16,000 at current spot price of $0.05 (30 Day Locking Requirement, No Token Burn, No Volume Requirement) + 9,000 BNB USD Value = $1,512,000 at current spot price of $168 (Account Balance Requirement, Tokens Burn, 30d Trade Volume Requirement) ``` So outside of the specialized locking requirements. For MDX to appreciate equal value of  BNB's fee structure $1,512,000, the MDX spot price would need to grow to $4.73.    Math: + 320,000 MDX x $4.73 = $1,512,000 + 9,000 BNB x $168.00 = $1,512,000 Their customer service is stellar as well, with 24/7 English support (native English) speaking support. Ask anyone who has had to go through token swaps, KYC, etc.  Mandala has a dedicated support channel in their Discord for any speed bumps or questions you may have. Additionally Mandala will also be listing it’s own complement of projects. Mandala aims to be a 1 stop shop for both Binance listed projects and high quality defi projects.  To further help attract projects and grow both liquidity and volume, Mandala Exchange recently won the most recent Hummingbot vote and will be included in release v0.37.0! Currently Hummingbot is only approved for use on: Binance  Coinbase Pro Huobi Global Bittrex Global Liquid KuCoin Kraken Radar relay Hummingbot adds the following features to Mandala Exchange: -Adds a trading bot for Mandala users. (DEX or CEX <-> Mandala arb strategies) - Adds a Mandala plug for 1350+ unique high volume traders (the people who benefit the most from the 320k club) and 6k bot users. - Opens liquidity mining campaigns for Mandala specific pairs (boost exchange volume by 5x-10x for these pairs via decentralized MM), entices new Mandala-specific listings. These campaigns will be copromoted with Hummingbot - coo Matches MDX with the people that will benefit from the current utility. MDX price appreciation. (buckle up. it's going to be fun) - Adds a revenue stream for Mandala users as they can learn to run the bot and earn money with their crypto holdings. Especially the MDX/USDT pair Mandala will not be listed officially on the major screeners (Gecko, CMC, etc.) as exchange until early March. So take advantage of this time.  If you missed out on BNB before it took off, now is your time to buy the little brother and enjoy the ride.  Oh and all funds on Mandala are actually stored in Binance wallets and insured under Binance SAFU https://www.mandala.exchange https://youtu.be/lF90VlYToQg",-1

This could take years however, and the fluctuations along the way could give lots of opportunities to sell for gains and buy back when it hits the floor again / corrects.

Looks like its down 10% on the day, if I can get something ~20% off its previous, I'll generally buy more.  But thats my strategy, and you shouldn't equate that to your wallet.   if this is your first crypto investment, I would recommend you hedge it with something else.  NFT's are a very hot market right now, and because of that their growth is exponential, but so is their falls when they come too.  And I've had money in MANA, ENJ and 1-2 others in that space.  While they have done me alright, they also need to be sold imo when they reach a peak and start to decline, you can buy back in later at a discount in almost all these situations. With that said, the project looks sound, and if its something you can get in ground floor on, or close to it, you should reap financial benefits, at least while the craze for NFT is going on, and the market is in bull form.

1616271979,"I mean, its similar to what some others are doing.  ONE and I think a few others, have ETH and BTC bridges along with other stuff that sounds similar, so that all those things can coexist upon the same blockchain and be traded equally.  I don't dabble in the swap sites and those types of things though due to the insane gas fees, so I can't really comment more than that. But, anything that has the ability to join things together and do so in a fluid and cohesive manner so that where you buy is no longer a question before what you buy.  Is a good thing.  Imagine if the NYSE and the NASDAQ had separate markets for every single type of stock platform, and not just micro / mid / large cap etc etc.   That's the biggest limitation in crypto in relation to adoption in the fiat marketplace",1
