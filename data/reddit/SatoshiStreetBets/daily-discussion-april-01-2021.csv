The reason we don't have memes up all the time is because without fail it causes the top 5 slots to be memes. We're thinking about ways to have memes mixed in with ordinary submissions, one being a bot we write that ensures only a percentage of the front page is memes.",1

They have no blockchain of there own.They are a shopping search engine using coinpayments to process there payment with fulfillment being done by a third party. They don't even charge tax for items. There developers don't check out (check linked in). The owner is a marketing background that sells domain names. The wife is the COO. The only person that checks out is the attorney. There is alot of hype behind this project on telegram with alot of fan boys.
