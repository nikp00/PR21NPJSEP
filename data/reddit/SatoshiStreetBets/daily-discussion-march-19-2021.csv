1616200705,"Guys PUNDI X will soon making a token swap meaning burnings of old token to decrease the token vol (1000 NPXS > 1 PUNDI X) and NPXS will change name to PUNDI X.   As previously announced, the token redenomination will commence at 14:00 GMT+8 on March 30, 2021. Based on community’s response, we’ve chosen PUNDIX as the token ticker of the new token after the token reduction. We think this strengthens the Pundi X brand and it’s easily recognized by people and exchanges. You can swap 1,000 NPXS tokens for 1 PUNDIX token. There is no change in the value of the new tokens a user holds after token redenomination compared to the total value of the old tokens. There are three ways to swap your NPXS for PUNDIX. Manual on-chain swap at the Pundi X official site Who: ERC20 compatible blockchain wallet holders How: Connect your private wallet to the Pundi X official swap site which will be available after March 30 on https://www.pundix.com. When: Anytime from March 30, 2021 to March 29, 2022. The holders decide. Result: Receive PUNDIX after the swap. The speed of receiving new tokens will depend on the traffic condition of the Ethereum network at the time. Advantages: Holders can keep PUNDIX in their private wallets and participate in the upcoming DeFi staking in April. Holders can also choose their preferred time to swap or trade NPXS or PUNDIX. Disadvantage: Need to pay ETH gas fee. 2. Auto swap in the XWallet Who: XWallet holders How: The process is automatic. Holders don’t need to do anything. When: March 30, 2021. Deposit and withdrawal will be suspended 24 hours before the swap. Result: Every 1,000 NPXS will become 1 PUNDIX automatically. Advantages: It’s automatic and there is no gas fee. Disadvantage: To participate in the decentralized staking, holders need to withdraw their PUNDIX tokens to their private wallets. 3. Auto swap in the supporting exchanges Who: Wallet holders on participating exchanges. How: The process is automatic. Holders don’t need to do anything. When: Depends on the exchange’s timeline. Please refer to the announcement from the exchanges. Result: Every 1,000 NPXS will become 1 PUNDIX automatically. Advantages: It’s automatic and no need to pay gas fee. Holders can trade PUNDIX immediately in the exchanges after the swap. Disadvantage: To participate in the decentralized staking, holders need to withdraw the PUNDIX tokens to their private wallets.",3

1616176143,Do u know when is next chz launch,3
1616179588,sorry to bother you. I was wondering how much do you get staking one. Im usually a swing trader and day trader. I wanted to see if its worth it.,1

1616189779,next level,1

1616131721,I agree. I was just pointing out the contradiction.  Usually people will share they're going all in because something is about to rally. Not that they're saving their money for a rally.,3

1616190391,Only watch out is BTC breaking support in lower timeframe...if it retraces and doesn't spike back then we might retrace,1
1616192467,I would slap it in bepro because there is a lower market cap than BTT and the project looks promising and we are still heavy early like stmx  But keep in mind I'm heavy bullish on bepro so no financial advice,1

1616195654,"Without knowing all the terms and conditions of when you can unstake and so on I'd say that seems like a pretty low risk bet.  Crypto.com is reputable, so is Dai and 12% is def a nice APY. I'm not qualified to give financial advice.",2
