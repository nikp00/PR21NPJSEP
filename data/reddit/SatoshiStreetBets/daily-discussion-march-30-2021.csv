I have been spending a lot of time trying to find some non-meme early opportunities into the NFT space and I think I have found a good one. $BLES is a very new NFT project that has a lot of potential in my opinion. What is it? In the NFT space, it can often be hard to understand what exactly a project does. Blind Boxes ($BLES) has a very strong, simple concept. It offers collectors the chance to own valuable NFTs, hidden in blind boxes. This concept is already popular with both physical and digital collector goods. Anyone ever bought a loot crate for an online game? Exactly. Tokenomics? Reached an ATH over 10$ soon after release. Hit a low around 5$. Up around 10% as I am writing this. Huge potential short and long term. We are talking 10x or even 100x this altcoin season. Where can I get it? Ethereum master race, get it on Uniswap. Binance inbreds, get it on PancakeSwap.

The bots have older accounts and more karma than you. So need to balance enforcement actions against locking out our users. In the meantime, it means everyone, like yourself, get to help with the signal to noise ratio. We're trying to steer a battleship. You can turn it, but it doesn't happen on a dime.  And I can tell you -- looking at the user reports -- the bystander effect is in full effect. Hardly any users are using the report button. That's the single best tool the community has to help us locate and ban the bots while we work on more automated solutions. (Also, if you want to get our attention, please use modmail.
