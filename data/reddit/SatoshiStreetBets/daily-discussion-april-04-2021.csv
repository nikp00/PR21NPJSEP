Does anyone else here remember trading on BTC-e with the live trollbox before any governments even recognized cryptocurrency? Anyone used a BTC faucet? God I've got some hardcore nostalgia.

1617603511,"**Digibyte DGB Will Raise At Least 1000 Times From Now Within Next 20 Month**     If you want to get rich quick and easy, all you need to do is spending some money into coin **Digibyte DGB**.     Within the next 20 month or so, I can guarantee that coin Digibyte DGB value will raise from under  $0.1 USD to at least $100.     Why I say so?    Because that how the secret controllers was planing.    Soon many big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, etc. Will sell their software and accept **Digibyte DGB** as another alternetive payment method.     Why **Digibyte DGB** but not any other coin such as Bitcoin, Ethererum, Dogecoin, TurtleCoin, DragonCoin , etc.?     **The Name, Number**    The online internet you guys are using are called as Digital. So it is much more easy and convenient  to have an online coin cryptocurrency as Digibyte.    It cannot be dog or turtle or dragon coin name, because they are endless other animal name in nature, so it pretty unfair to only choose 1.     Do you know the magic number of iconic Bitcoin? 21,000,000 (21 millions).    Do you know the total number amount of Digibyte DGB will be mined in the future? 21,000,000 (21 billions).     That is another great signal.     **Transaction Fees, Technology**    Transaction fee via online internet must be cheap and quick.    If you have tried and know about Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. You will notice they are too expensive, you need to spend at least $4-5 USD (as of this writing) for just the transaction fees to get your transaction completed instantly. While if you want to pay lower fees, then you will need to wait around 24 hours. In some case, if you willing to pay too little fee, your transaction will never be completed ! What a joke !     The Digibyte have best fastest technology and the lowest transaction fee out of all current coin cryptocurrency on the market. And it is the only cryptocurrency able to handle big massive amount transactions once many giant tech companies start accept crypto coin.     For all that reasons, the next big cryptocurrency coin must be the Digibyte DGB.    It will raise from now under <$0.1 to at least $100 USD (1000 times).    So if you invest $1000 now, you will become millionaire within the next 20 month or so for sure !    Do not sell out if the Digibyte value under $100 USD.     Don’t forget to make fair amount of donation to me for this tip.    **Digibyte DGB**    DHNMsFVQQruZscnPZ39b2cuQy5AQnwwW97    DhyRrst5LmSKQR9draJ8YKNLoTCBUJX8sj    DRXj1hnH6r8wBjWtjygYVwrNXFoAVuHiJe    DL4CAfLNSqNWU9AqrxHdstQgJr9ktV4uph    D6P9LtSKFtLvxHLuRajbcv29Npfht82Uj9     Best Regard,    **The Savior**",-5

1617626268,"Other than the April fool's fiasco there's some really weird shit behind the staking also. It's just a weird feeling that I can't put my finger on, but something doesn't feel right. So many people were complaining about not being able to bridge their coins from binance to the harmony staking site. There was a white paper online telling people to sell on binance, purchase litecoin, transfer the litecoin over to Harmony One, and then convert the litecoin back to ONE coin on their site. I'm not sure if you buy directly from Harmony One if that counts towards exchange numbers.",1

1617596707,Yup. Coincheck I hit a snag and need to resend driver's license pic. Bitflyer I had no issues with but I don't use it. I mainly just use binance.,1
1617599182,I only put a 100 bucks in as a joke haha. But now I see the potential. I feel like shit for selling my BTT at .007 and not buying DREP when it dropped to .25,2
1617607861,"Watching what you ""could have made"" will always drive you insane, after I sold my 25BTC for $275 a piece I was too salty to look at the markets for almost 8 years.

1617639000,My xrp shows on crypto.com but can't buy or sell any. My shit on Binance just disappeared. 🤣 It tells me the number of coins but doesn't show a price.,1

1617617645,It will!,3
1617582406,"I've learned to never bet against this thing, I had at .72 cents and it went down to .67 and I bet against it and sold and woke up and it was at .82 cents, still kicking myself but bought back in later. But do you research and don't take my advice, this is just what I went through on the last 24 hours it's better to not gain than lose",3
1617628674,Well looks like VET carried your portfolio even more for the last 10hrs!! Carry VET and VTHO which supports it and you won’t need to worry about staking anything,2
1617630022,"Don't try to kick all your little catch phrases to me. ""Invest money that you don't need"" ... I've made my money and then some. But nobody expected Binance to fuck over millions of people and hold their coins hostage for a week.",2
