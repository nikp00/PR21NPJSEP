As for the remaining open interest, bulls are mainly in control because the recent price hike to a new all-time high obliterated 84% of the bearish options. As expiry gets closer, a growing number of put options will lose their value if BTC remains above $52,000, increasing the advantage from the neutral-to-bullish call options.""

1616678132,"The more it goes, the more it looks like 2017-2018. BTC crashes by pans, but everyone told to 'HODL' as it will go up a bit later, or better, to 'buy the dips' Irrealistic Ponzi schemes touted as the next miracle to make big profits, like hoge, or all those poddle etc... More and more 'guru groups' on Telegram and other channels to give strategies for profit and Nostradamus style predictions. We will see where we are in a few weeks, but I would not be surprised by a BTC going down by pans step by step below 40 or 30k, then even much lower, and people still saying to 'buy the dip'. The same for Alts. In 2017, it was predicted that BTC would be about 50.000 by the end of 2018, Lots of TA, graphs, charts, divination made around 1 twitter or 1 comment in the news... Sounds familiar? It will be beneficial to USDT for sure, as people won't be able to claim huge amount of FIAT when it crashes like that. It will as well be beneficial for the trading platforms, that can liquidate as many people as they want, in clear, that's still a heavily manipulated market. In 2018, some people did heaps of money when they sold at high/very high. The others one tried to think that they were suddenly 'HODLER', holding bags of coins and BTC that had only 1/5th of their value. They have been lucky, as some, but not all, went up, and over. Never forget that a ADA 'HODLER' got back merely their money a couple weeks ago when they bought close to the old ATH,  Now if it crashes like 2018, I do not expect a 'new chance' in 1-2-3 years. Investors, people will have been badly burned once in 2018, they saw that 'Hoooodllling' made them have a profit in 2021, only for it to crash within days. Most serious or big investors will just pull the plug, or pull the plug at much lower prices.  Let's see the next coming days, it could be very interesting.",-2

1616692220,"Depends on the strength and momentum of the coin, One has had awesome resiliency and yesterday recovered so quick during a 2 hr time scale that the dip was just on long downward wick. However, this is a larger scale drop for BTC that will likely pull all things down for a few days at least and One's RSI was already around 96 for the 3 day and 94 for the 1 week so it was already about tapped and ready to cool down for a bit. Have to remember, most big coins have been almost straight up from a larger macro level and they need some time to consolidate before they move again. Add in things like the 6 billion or so in options that are about to expire on Bitcoin and the stock market and everything is pulling it down right now.

1616689366,"Real news, not fake ones. BTC is crashing, to suit as well the people behind the 'futures' and leverage contracts. All well organized so far.",2
1616690482,"Well the big deal is that most prices are higher than they were 50 years ago, from 0 to what they are today. The big deal is that people realize now that there is no such thing as 'resistance' or 'support' level, and that scares off the institutional investors. It is very doubtful that people with funds to invest will be willing to take on BTC at 62k, to be at 50 2 weeks after, or lower... One part is due to a heavy market manipulation, granted, that needs regulations. Some platforms and funds do manipulate the prices to be able to liquidate long or shorts, whichever is the most profitable. And that's something that anyone who has to manage risks would notice.  The second point is that, apart from a manipulation of the market to liquidate shorts or longs, we will more depends on large investors in the cryptoworld, and they won't enter, and even leave, if they realize it is a basic manipulated market. Prices can go up and down, but it is highly speculative on one side, and it does not follow any logic. Granted, the stock market reacts a little bit the same way, but much less. There are figures, assets, values that value or devalue a stock. In the cryptos, it is more the platforms and contract makers that think 'well let's fuck the short, we will make good profit', or 'so many long, we crash the price and pick up easy money'. That's how investors and institutions see it more and more. I am just waiting to see if BTC goes below 50k tonight. If it goes below 45k in the coming days, then it means it is 2018 ver. 2.0 that will come back.",1
1616689655,"Well it is more complicated than that, to be honest. The whales take back the exact quantity of coins the put on a platform back. They do not accumulate coins, if you look at Blockchain explorer... It was like that since a couple of weeks already As for bullish, no, there is a heavy market manipulation, to liquidate all the long positions and make mass profit for a few anonymous people and the trading platforms ( that could be the one playing after their customer, after all, like it was documented 2 years ago, and proven). BTC goes down now to liquidate a lot of contracts, and they can cash in. Anyway I was met with such skepticism in 2018, where I did pull the plug on time, not to be a happy HODLer for 3 years of uncertainty. Let's see how the coming days look like. I do not see why 'whales' would try to accumulate BTC at cheaper price, and crash its price, where it would make more sense in fact to play with Alts and buy BTC, as in a bullish market, the ALts gain way more than the price increase of BTC.",2
