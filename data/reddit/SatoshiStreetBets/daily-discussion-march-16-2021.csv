1615892072,"Crazy story! 😴 So I jump into harmony $one last night at .0800 cents. It shot up to about .0850 after a couple of hours but I said ""Nah! I'll wait and try to get to .0940!"" I wake up around 4:00 a.m. and I saw that it dipped again to about .0804 and rose back up to .0850 so I'm like ""Fuck it! I'll sell it!""  Mind you ...I'm half sleep ...and I'm trying to put my limit sale in and it keeps telling me INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT. I'm going to my coin screen on binance and I'm looking and it's clearly telling me I have the amount that I'm trying to sell. I keep going back trying to put my limit sell in but it keeps telling me INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT! Then I glance at the price and in 2 minutes its shot up to .0870. Now I'm really scrambling trying to sell and then I realize ""Oh shit! I still have my previous limit sell in!""  I go to cancel that, come back to the screen to put in a new limit sell order, and notice the price is now at .0880. So I'm like fuck it ... let's see how hard it goes. It shoots through 900 and I put my order in and I'm happy! (Then I wake back up 2 hours later and see it shot to 0.10, but I'll be happy with what I can get)  Being sleepy actually helped me double my money! 😂🤣😂🤣",5

1615909967,"Here's a little personal thought and prediction: The top 2 or even 3 crypto coins are very unlikely to become real general use currency and become more like gold and silver. Everyone is already using digital currency in the form of their earned dollars (or any other standard) in their respective countries being deposited into bank accounts and using tap to pay for things. Yes, there are jobs that will still pay you cash and some people may even prefer cash, but these are usually not the kind of jobs that are highly desired or approved by banks for loans and such.  The reason the top 2 are unlikely to become normal cash any time soon is because: human greed. I believe that thing always triumphs over ANY hope, desire, or philosophy in the financial world. If people want the top 2 to store value with some stability or volatility, they will remain that way. Gold is accepted as legal tender everywhere. How many of us make transactions for daily items with that thing? Even back when precious metals were actually used as coins, most people used bronze or copper coins of lower denominations as every day cash. Having said that, I think one of the future or current digital coin may just become the norm for everyday life. I guess correctly guessing which one would be the million dollar question. If anything can rival greed, it is the need. If there is a need for a universal coin for everyday life, there will be one.",6

This is a lot more than Theta did last year though, and don’t forget the large Tier 1 Tournaments coming in 2021 for verasity. Theta with its huge marketcap could not even achieve 200k views on their tournament last year, while we did 8.6 million last year. This reiterates that they are non - competitors. Our competition is not crypto projects. Our competition is non crypto companies which is why we are the first truly hybrid company catering to both but with unique PoV blockchain tech. We will follow this path to growth and the rest will follow as day follows night. Our partners include Tencent Athena and Warmania. We have lots of different new games being added to ESFC continuously. Our partners are larger than any of our non - competitors.",2

Trust was good because it works for Eth mainnet and BNB smartchain.  Going to pay some fees, but I have been able to buy and send right away.  MetaMask wallet also lets you buy ETH right away then send. Voyager app for example you buy then have to wait 3-5 days to send to a wallet.",1

1615930601,Get it,2
1615892632,"The best answer I can give you, is it has some.  Its off about 20% from its high, so it has the legs to get back there at least and well beyond in many people's views.   Where does it end up?  That's a tough call, I'm not an oracle by any means.  I just read, way too much ;)",3

1615932111,my maximum bet is only $100 on low volume stuff..,2
1615942513,Maybe because Stimulus checks arriving = more people buying/shopping online and more people getting into crypto.  Heaps of people will be shopping and once they secure someone like Amazon it will probably go crazy.,1
1615942620,What do you feel is behind the pump. Anything specific to stormx,1
1615881229,Understandable! Go and check out one of the hot posts on the r/cardano page for a nice visual comparison of energy consumption between BTC/ETH/ADA. Edit: [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/m5jdf6/comparison_of_energy_usage_amongst_biggest/),3

1615878705,"Absolutely. Another one to look at is VRA. They have a patent on their Proof-of-view technology for the next 17 years. POV allows video and streaming platforms to weed out fake views, which will be absolutely massive once more platforms start to adopt it. YouTube is already on board.",3
1615885907,"Well, firstly - their gaming platform already exists and is a real, functional product Secondly, their tech allows a lot of additional products to be built like prediction markets, P2P betting, informational markets, De-Fi gaming, etc. Allow building on Ethereum, Polkadot or Binance Chain.

1615858583,"All true.  But what does HOGE offer that the other 10,000+ alt coins don’t? Something about memes, something about NFTs, the future is bright, blah blah blah. Ok. Truth time.   Q: Why is HOGE great?   A: We’re all early adopters.  The coin has a lot of zeros after that decimal point and those zeros are disappearing quick. We’re earning passive income by getting a share of any transactions and just holding.  The coin price is so low, we can dream about it mooning kind of like when you purchase a lottery ticket.  But what’s the use for HOGE? How will it be used? uh, well...They’re working on it, lol. Ok.  But who cares? It’ll turn out fine, probably.  Until then, you’re job is to tell the next guy how great it is so they can get in after you, and so on and so on. We’re shilling now so we can make pillows out of future HOGE holders fiat donation later.",2

1615859302,"You forgot to mention the awesome tokenomics, which were the biggest selling point for me",1
1615943013,STMX is easy to buy because it’s listed on Voyager and they have instant deposits so a lot of people are getting on voyager and buying it because of its low marketcap,1
1615943132,"Storm X is application that lets people shop and earn crypto. When stimulus checks are typically given out, it is to boost the economy, so people will be shopping and the general rise of crypto will help Storm X get more customers.   I have invested into it so I am playing on the coming week of stimulus to really pump it. I am no financial expert though, so do your own research!",1
1615994681,Yesterday I was looking at the top losers of the day and I noticed it made the list and I snapped it 🆙,1
1615943239,"Voyager has 40+ other altcoins listed too, none of them pump like this.",1
1615943332,I don’t know for sure but I think it’s because it’s cheap and a lot of people want in on some cheap coins with a low marketcap and STMX has been on the move since last week and they have been getting a lot of attention on Twitter lately,1
