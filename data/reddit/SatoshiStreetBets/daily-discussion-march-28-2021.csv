1616971935,"I know this is a shit coin but it definitely has a potential..   The origin.. The origin of this shitcoin is sometime recently Elon musk tweeted out ""If there is ever a scandal around my name please call it Elongate"" I am not going to bullshit you into saying it's going to 100x however it does have potential  Links and more info $ELONGATE is a frictionless yield & liquidity generation token that works by applying 10% fee for each transaction and instantly splitting that fee by rewarding holders with 5% tokens and auto locking 5% in Pancake LP. Holders dont need to do anything than just hold their token to earn rewards.

1616912739,Fair enough thanks for your advice. I have a lot of ANKR but will have a look into MANA coin. Cheers and good luck,1
1616926015,"Click on connect at the top right and select your wallet. I used Metamask, so WalletConnect worked for me. Even though there is a Metamask option that didn't work.",1

1616963019,It has been staked on Kraken since I purchased it. I love the 12%. I wish it would go up in value more though. It's having a bad weekend.,1
1616982732,"I agree matic reminds me of xlm, just going sideways. What about HNT? How the heck did you call SOL, that was a true sleeper?  Get you some MANA, broke the 1.0 resistance, now will consolidate above 1.0 and then move higher. Not FYA and DYOR :)",1
1616897566,Done and done! Got me 3k coins to start 🙏,4

1616963025,Both preferably. ONE has been a very strong performer and STMX is a functional utility token with real use.,6
1616990683,"Thank you, looks interesting but I don't think I am advanced enough for a bot yet.",2
1617045816,Is it worth it from your experience? I was going to go for the 'hero' one but not sure if 'botting' will require technical skills I probably don't have...,1
1616985443,SOL was a bots TA 1hr call..  i usually buy the 4hr though,2

1617045839,My thoughts exactly.,1
1616899993,No worries I've been looking at this one for some time now,3
1616991206,"HAHA, no kidding but I appreciate your sharing in the group here, you've made some really good predictions.",2
1617045952,"Even with the 'hopper'? I was hoping that would leave some room for a life, having no bot is taking up loads of time anyway.",1
