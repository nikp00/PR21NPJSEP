1615652544,"About 300 millions 'stablecoins' minted in the last 24H to pump the BTC. Others, the bots removed all the USDT they could on all the Alts (which explain the crash, sorry 'correction') to pump BTC. And no one can tell me that they got the back up before they minted those 300 millions 'disneylanddollars'! The reason, in most cases things are 'minted' with 'assets'. So if they have BTC, if they pump it to 60k, then each BTC 'backs up' 60k of Disnelyand 'stablecoins', and the total of the BTC backs up a huge chunk of all the 'stablecoins'. Which means a circular scheme, pump the value of the guarantee with what you borrow. Impossible in the real world, except that here, they can mint BEFORE their guarantee to have the right to mint is checked, hence they can pump that guarantee with stablecoins that will be 'guaranteed' as a result of the pump.

It goes up, saving the ass of many stablecoins \- By crashing deeply most ALTs, when people sell, they will be worth less stablecoins, saving ( temporarily) the ass of the stablecoins for now.",1

1615654469,"No, because some bots needed to remove Stablecoins to pump the BTC. That's the new strategy of some of the 'stablecoins' they sell off their portfolio to make stablecoins, pump BTC that is their major asset to back up their shitstablecoins, Before they were minting a couple hundreds millions stablecoins, and pumping BTC, that they use to back up their whole stablecoin pool. Good investment, just use 100-200 millions to 'back up' with BTC 5-20 billions of stablecoins, and even keep the 100-200 millions at the end. Now, they are more careful, and they pull a lot of stablecoins from the ALTs to pump up BTC. Honestly and frankly, no one would buy BTC at 60k if it is not to use it as an asset to back up something else. Normal investors would never, ever, buy BTC at 60k. Tomorrow it will go down, or in 2-5 days, everyone knows it. But for saying ' well BTC can go up to 60k, so we use 1 BTC to back up 60k of dollarshitstablecoins, all fine', it is worth for a handful of companies to pump it to the max, even loosing profit and money, in truth. But ENJ recovers very fast and well, and it has 'real' value. It shows however how influent the bots and whales are in all coins. It is funny to notice that until ENJ became much more 'public' and widespread, it did not follow BTC. Suddenly, when ENJ starts to be a coin where many people earn a lot of money with, it 'follows' BTC at the second. Then it is sold in bulk to pump BTC. It is all a stablecoin scamstory coming soon.... But ENJ is really a safe investment.",2

They can't play the same games in this market they do in the NYSE and NASDAQ, because this isn't something where they can pay regulators to just turn a blind eye.   Its not the same game my friend.  The only perk their money will bring as whales, is more money into my pocket.  If they have the ability to nuke something down 90%, I'm not running, I'm buying that shit, 100/100 times.",4
1615665338,"It is not true. Most BTC are in anonymous, private hands. Some of the biggest wallets started to move in December, and no on knows who has them. We have as well the guys who will open their mega wallets when they go out of jail, for drugs, for pedos... A very, very wild fauna in the future. Always remember that most of the BTC from things like SilkRoad etc... still do exist. And they represent a very good chunk of the total BTC that exists. Remember too that the BTC story was for certain started by a team, and nearly certain a government or very large organization, that did not need to cash the early wallets. Anyone who would be a biz or individual would have cashed when it was close to 20 at least a part of their wallets. A gov or large 'organization' that has which purposes, no one knows, does not need to do so, because they do not earn. Time will tell. But I think that if people try to make a stable economy around BTC, one day they will have a massive, destructive surprise. Think a bit who would keep 10.000 BTC or way more for several years, just come out since some months. Not an individual, not a financial organization/biz. Short answer, big organization or government. I am not in the conspiracy, but after careful analysis, there is no other reply to the question 'who started BTC'. Buy BTC now is foolish, everyone knows it is going to do a good 10% or more dip very, very soon.",4

1615657075,Thanks dude! I just bought a bag. I will get playing the game to try and earn some too now you've said that!,1
1615603750,For anything it's literally worth 0 and u can't transfer it,1
1615664693,🐕 DOGE went up 20% just this week.  Don’t believe me. Believe your eyes! ;)),1
1615658531,In weeks time this peak will look like a dip,4
1615659762,Won't be a peak for long sir,1
1615662349,Buy and hold! Lol,2
1615663333,I don’t want to sound like I have a ton of money or don’t value it but I could throw $1000 into any of these and be fine losing it. Do they really 100x? Like I just finally bought some of the safe moon and have no clue how to even tell what price I got in for lol.,1
1615663515,"Yeah I didn't by them for that great one pager whitepaper and the solid usecase. Just make a few bucks, sell when you're happy and throw it at Rocket Bunny 🐰🐰🐰🚀🚀🚀",1
1615667150,Nice haha,1
1615680005,"I think they've got a competition for btc coming out, March 16th maybe?",2
1615680744,age of rust,1
1615680062,"I dunno, if I was a profit I'd be a millionaire, im just making a guess, I heard enj has a contest thing for btc coming out",1
1615604169,"or sad pumps on things like One and Eng...  sell high, buy low",1
1615664545,can you explain,1
1615664087,"Sounds good. I’m holding ETH, LTC, and DOGE",1
1615665836,"Don't try to fight Enculman, the dude is a roach, he's never gonna go away",1
1615665844,Ya i am not speaking to u I am talking to all the partial coiners who should prolly own as much as they can at a fair price,1
1615665782,Nah institutional investment totals 60ish % of 2021 investment / retail slowly dissipating / Also no duh corrections are healthy thats why u dca / I am not trying to argue with u I am just stating a fact,0
1615653406,"Definitely, and the African story must be a joke, at least I hope it is !",1
1615607160,What platform to trade in US? I’m struggling to find a good one,2
1615633467,"We all here for the ride - the coins will come and go but the stories will be what makes all of this memorable. None of us can really say we expected it to reach this high, I remember when it crossed 800 and everyone was freaking out, let alone when it hit 15k 😂",2
1615668852,Clearly lol,3
1615609499,"Look under Deposits > Crypto.  See if there's a yellow bunch of text. Also, if you login to the site, you have to wait 3 minutes before you can withdraw.  It should tell you that though",1
1615613827,"Whoa, slow your roll. I’m a BIG holder of ONE and a contributing member of the ONE community. It’s not “mooning” tonight to $1 dude. And we celebrate every progressive and organic move it makes.",2
1615625322,"Me too. Love their project, just hate the recent $ growth money wise 😭 thru a $1000 in and it keeps dropping 😞 but they got a good thing going on. Just gotta wait it out. Until then... ENJ, CHZ, CHR, MANA & of course BTC 🚀🔥🚀🔥🚀🔥",2
1615656539,Good times to stock up on ADA ☝️ 💎👐,2
1615662189,🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀,3
1615600530,The circulating supply is wrong on coinmarketcap,3
1615602365,"Musta missed what I said.  Its cost me some gains that way.  Patience is not one of my strong suits.  I bought BAT this morning.  It has the weekend, and if its not even or positive by Monday its gone, losses or not.",1
1615609564,"profit taking right now, like many",1
1615621320,It's pretty steady right now so depending on the next 24 hrs I'll prob move 50% of it into LTC. Apparently it has potential to grow like ADA. Let's see.,1
1615638326,"My, that's a lot of spice! All those chillies are gonna be 🔥 soon enough.  Congratulations on your future fat stacks!",2
1615645019,💎👐,1
1615604441,"Transfer to a decentralised exchange if problems persist, have you tried contacting them?",1
1615664700,"Yeah, I broke a rule, but with the money I moved I bought ONE, and then moved something else back over to MANA.  I made a solid decision, but it felt hurtful at the moment",3
1615664316,To check the price you just put all your safe moons as if you were to swap for usdt or some coin that’s $1 to see how much you have,2
1615664637,"XEM was part of an airdrop, where people got something for nothing.  So they bought a ton right before the snapshot, and then dumped it as soon as the snapshot took place.  Its probably gonna have a hard time recovering, if ever.  Because the spike in interest for it, was simply to get free shit.",1
1615666981,"Yeah a lot of americans still only think of crypto as bitcoin, doge has helped to shine a light but it's still a ways off from mainstream investing.  I'm holding: LTC ETH VET HBAR VTHOR SAFEMOON HOGE CHAINLINK ADA DOGE UNI XLM",2
1615666180,Ya i've learned not to argue I am just stating what I see / I wan't the people to own as much as possible before a whole coin is worth 100k / 77k / what ever u think it will go to / the people need to get the fair price not the big money,2
1615665903,Plus omahtree ur smart I am speaking to those that buy shit coins with out realizing the powers of btc as a new store of value,1
1615665950,You sure you shouldn't be over in the /r/GMEbagholdersclub,1
1615607355,"Yea I had to search around for a good US one but I use KuCOIN a lot and crypto.com (they have a debit card also). And coinbase is decent, Just can’t get a lot of coins on there.",1
1615607603,"I use Coinbase for like the main ones, but I’m needing to find one I can buy these alt coins like CHZ, HOGE. Tryna get to the moon. I just downloaded KuCoin but it’s not showing US as a location",1
1615625451,I even say add more ADA. just put my CHZ gains in it. thank me later 🤓,3
1615600582,I thought it looked weird lol,2
1615638494,yolo!,2
1615665584,thanks man its very clear now.    What coins do you recommend (if possible listed on binance)? cheers,1
1615667018,Understood! Thanks mate,1
1615666230,Ohmatree I thought we where friends :'( i am insulted,1
1615625537,Hopefully 🙏,2
1615600853,I was thinking the same thing about 2 minutes before you posted.,2
1615638713,This is a potential coin 👍🤞🤞🤞...perfect for soccer 😬😂😂🚀🚀🚀🚀,2
1615666414,"I got nothing personal against man.  I just feel like your message is one of ""We the bois and we need to protect the fort"".  It really isn't that man.  Like I said, the decentralization of this is simple.  Their money is going to drive this up, just as yours and mine does.  We've doubled market cap in 60 days.   I'm happy you want to rally the troops, but for what?  There's so many millionaires made from the space, that at one point, we were all just fucking around with dumb internet coins.",1
1615626655,ADAs Gute 😄,2
1615666605,That is fair / BTC isn't going anywhere but sure alts will make u more money but what do people do with that profit besides re buy shit coins as institutional buys more btc / I am happy either way I just hope people don't forget about the king btc,1
1615666794,"Some of us have a very formulated exit strategy.  Acquire X, once X is solved for.  Exit. My is easily achieved compared to others, I was planning on that exit in 5 years.  I can probably do it in another 6 months tops.  Then poof, wipe the slate and go enjoy it all.",1
1615668187,Of course an exit strategy is needed as long as people don't just sit on their cash for the next five years we are okay,1
1615668234,We've talked before and you are a very smart person / it's the new fish I want to reach those are the people I want my message to reach,1
1615669102,"You aren't going to reach them yet.  They're still asking why BTC was #2 on the market cap chart.  You really gotta give em a good week of losing their asses, then they'll wake up.  Today they are glassy eyed.  Just wait till they're punching holes in cans of beans with a dull knife because they spent the gains they didn't capture.",1
