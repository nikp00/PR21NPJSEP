1616350805,"Most crypto youtubers are twats. Its disgusting to listen to a lot of them. They are not realistic and above all else, they are often clearly amateurs.  Kudos to you if you create content, but please don't create content with the quantity over quality mindset. You will play a significant role in killing the market's true potential by being a cheap snake oil salesman.  I'm sick to death of youtubers in general cheating the system. It's broken so that creators feel compelled to recycle and reuse things that already work so now we have 100s of channels who's sole strategy is to fill the 10 minutes up as deceptively empty as they can, take a thumbnail with a silly face on, and post it with a grand question or idea as the title.

1616333018,"Ok guys, as always DYOR and my disclaimer is that I enjoy eating red crayons over blue. In the last few weeks, I’ve narrowed my portfolio down to 2 cryptos, they are Harmony ONE and Celer Network. My goal is to continue to rise the gains they’ve accrued and then switch to something I actually want to invest in long term. ONE is okay for that, CELR I’m not so sure but it’s a bull at the moment and will be for some more time.  Here’s why. I’ve compared the following coins: CELR, ONE, ADA, XLM, XRP, RVN, SKL, ENJ, MATIC, OGN, VET, STMX, BTT, CRO. Here’s an example of how I compare a coin versus another-Celer is sitting at a value of 6.6 cents at the moment with 10 billion total supply; ADA is sitting at a value of $1.19 with 45 billion total supply; the math on this is that right now ADA is valued 81x CELR. Guess what?! It’s probably in actuality 81x more valuable in the long term but in this run what everyone wants is something that can turn a profit and fast! Don’t believe me, look at how many people jump on HOGE and other coins of similar value at thousandths of a cent, they all want the 10x multiplier.  Out of all of the coins i mentioned above, STMX is the only one valued less than CELR with a huge growth potential still. ONE is only valued 3x more than CELR/STMX which is why I still believe it has a large growth potential as well, followed by in order-OGN, ENJ, BTT.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not hating on ADA; it’s a solid project and has great potential, but it’s been pushed a lot this cycle already and while I can definitely see it’s trend continue upward, it’s very hard to fight the appeal of buying something at 6.6 cents like CELR or 13.6 cents like ONE when there’s literally 4x less coins in existence. Just look at how much money would need to be dumped into ADA to simply double its price vs how little can be put into some other coins.",2

1616335122,So how is the rest of the day gonna be. A pump in the evening or another dump. Usually I would say it's weekend and Monday coming up so it's a dump. But the last couple of weekends didn't turn out all that bad.,2

1616298219,I agree completely,2

The company looks good to, their app is user friendly, crypto cash back on purchases with some well known brands already included, crypto rewards for playing games advertised on the app and more, staking at 17.5% pa.

1616334042,Bwahaha. Not used anymore?!? The on switch hasn't even been built. Once its on it will be fine. Buy some Dot in the meantime and stake. Maybe even buy some BADGER if you want real money,3
1616335776,It is risky now right? Up a lot already,2
1616335359,Ye,1
1616304507,Its slightly overvalued right now imho.  Its going through a price correction and then will probably consolidate before moving on again. But it has sound fundamentals and actually a working product as we speak. This is one to hold.,2

1616362833,"I'd like to find something like that, too",1
1616371715,Use both and I would recommend also using Kucoin and Binance. You can withdraw from crypto.com and then transfer coins via LTC for low fees and quickness to other platforms to trade,1
1616371764,Even in the U.S.? I tried to create an account and it didn’t have United States as an option for a country when I tried to create my account.,1

1616341816,Im waiting to get approved. Does it take long for [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) to approve you,1
1616346899,Should I buy more then? 😜,3
1616297208,"Yeah! Same! I bought in at .000110, but I bought because of the potential. The circulating supply is high now, but once we hit exchanges and the trading volume goes back up. We are going to see massive burns. When the trading volume was at its peak, we were seeing almost a billion coins burned per day. I believe that will be the catalyst and hoge's secret weapon in the future.",2
1616297318,"What we need to see is swing traders trading at high volume! That will be the thing that dwindles the supply down. When people see how quickly its burning, we will see more long term investors. It could steam roll very soon. Matter of fact, i believe this could one day be seen as a store of value.",1
1616297463,"I mean, once it is at a 100 million supply (years down the line) we will only be seeing fractions of the coin bought and fractions more of it being burned. As it sits right now, it has the potential to burn super quickly. Buying now is the smartest thing to do. The dev team is doing a great job with marketing and makes it a point to celebrate every milestone and the community is just as loud. We are seeing the beginning of something huge and people will be very happy when it finally comes to fruition.",1
1616308869,"u are mostly correct..  still dont understand vtho pump, but i am not totally stupid either  ..and it's fun making u vomit in mouth lol  ;p",1
1616370336,Great move on your part,2
1616325729,"I’m scared it’s going the PnD Route. I prefer slow and steady. Meteoric rise usually means danger ahead with these “little” guys. I hate this stupid trend. Shallow greed and quick money. No knowledge or support of a project. No wisdom to see how something could create long term positive change. It’s frustrating, even though I get that that’s just the way of the world.",1

1616297754,"The community development is the biggest asset as you will have real life applications for the coin. The community is solid and that is the value behind hoge. You can buy any coin high and sell low but if you buy a coin that redistributed back to you and you can use it for NFTs, games, charity donations etc why not?",2
1616297504,I agree but Hoges biggest challenge right now is availability we need exchange listings and it'll soar. It's too hard for new crypto traders to aquire right now.,2
