You buy 1,000 coins for $20 for them to give you another 10 coins a year? That makes no sense!  You've already killed the value in two days by .05 cents just by pulling your coins off the exchanges. Think about how much more you're going to kill the value over the next few weeks and months.  Your coins have the most value keeping them on the exchanges with people buying and selling and the price increasing. Now that they've fooled you into pulling all your coins off the exchanges all it does is stagnate the prices.  Never seen someone shoot themselves in the foot to devalue a coin like this!

1616859532,"Honestly you just have to go with your best judgment, if you see a coin with a chart that looks like a dip, watch it for like a day and see if it keeps dipping or stays sideways. Usually after coins skyrocket, they’ll come back down a bit and possibly even dip harder and then stay sideways on the graph. It’s all about timing with crypto since it can be traded 24/7",2

Break up with your girl. Years later, hit her up. Be drunk enough for her to laugh off ur differences but sober enough to remember to ask for that paper. Call a friend. Again. Call a friend, or your mom or dad, don't drive drunk plz! Head over to your exs house and get that paper! (Litterally). As you get dropped off to her house, tell your ride to leave, you won't be needing them anymore, heck they may not even see you after this. Login to your account, pass out drunk.

1616823750,"I own COVAL & CELL, two LEGIT small cap coins that I think are incredible opportunities because of their utility in this space and in how they will affect in part, along with many other coins, how we transact our finances in the future. And those other coins there are so many of them but despite doing well for a living I don’t have the buying power for all of the 60-70 coins that I really like. And I do recognize that the more people on here that look into a Coval or CELL or LABS or STORMX, or a CHAINeven as big as an ALGO or LINK, the more my crypto wallet goes up but the difference is here that despite being irrelevant in the grand scheme of things I personally feel very strongly about the opportunities that I feel are out there in the coins I’m invested in, and just want to spread the word for everyone’s benefit. At the end of the day I’m not a financial advisor and by no means am I saying to leverage your house and go buy LABS cause I own it. No way. We are our own community of SatoshiStreetBets, let’s all help each other. I can tell you that I do 4-5 hours of research every night and I get excited and give my opinion to help others and all of us grow our wealth.",2

1616854027,Can’t sweat the small dips,1
1616870226,Could it be that trading volumes are low because less people are buying?,1
1616844508,???,1
1616830254,volume changes are always best indicator around here,1
1616903028,Absolutely agree,1
1616812927,"oh, you mean crypto's..?  well, i been tossing 20's at all kinds of stuff (instead of 100's) and am now more diversified than i ever have been and at all kinds of different prices.  But i am cheering mostly for enj, one, and vet..  ;)",3
1616833806,you can still use binance.us for charts cant ya?,1
1616887623,Good advice!,2

1616854796,I'm not holding any ANKR at the moment sold the ones that I had from mid 30 sat at 250 and don't regret anything :D,2

1616889806,"Thanks! I know crypto can get frustrating believe me. I remember I bought Harmony during one of its “peaks” and it dipped hard. Was mad at myself, but still held and now I couldn’t be happier",3
1616859953,I wouldn’t either! Nice trade,1
1616889969,Thanks brotha! I appreciate that! And hopefully I’ll be in the same boat! Didn’t throw in that much but still haha. Whenever I throw in it always drops haha. And I threw in on ONE and it blew up and I got excited hahah.,1
1616953849,She’s movinggggg,1
1616863206,I'm trying to spread awareness of that some of the coins are extremely overpriced at the moment and by buying them HIGH is very risky. I'm trying help people not losing money. It's good when price goes UP and UP but it can't go UP forever and there will be a time like 2018 when people will lose lots of money (those who aren't prepare to hold for long term or can't take that much of lose) .,1
