I missed out on Cardano and Dot, but if Radix is able to deliver on it's vision then this should easily fall somewhere in the top 5. Just wish I would have found it at it's ATL. But $0.16 is still very cheap, thats only 4x from public sale, its nothing compared to other coins. There is inflation, yes, so you should calculate with a total supply of 10 billion tokens, but XRD could become another DOT, so a 40-50 billion marketcap ($5 token price) is absolutely doable once people start developping game changing Dapps on Radix. Remember: Radix has huge investors including Transferwise, a top team including ex-employees from Microsoft and Consensys, and a unique DLT / consensus that is going to provide almost unlimited scalability and atomic cross sharded composability.
