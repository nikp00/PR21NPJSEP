1616323817,"Cryptocurrency Trading in Hong Kong  Alright guys, so I've done a lot of research on trading crypto trading in Hong Kong and I cannot seem to figure out the entire thing properly. I also am finding a hard time figuring out the information regarding taxes in Hong Kong. From what I've understood so far: \-> There are no proper Cryptocurrency Exchanges based in Hong Kong especially those that contain the majority of coins including altcoins. \-> There is no capital gains tax (short-term or long-term). So this means I do not owe the government anything if I make a profit on my crypto trading. Please reassure this if you have the knowledge regarding the same. I am based in Hong Kong and I want to trade cryptocurrencies. I have a Hong Kong bank account and I would like to deposit from my Hong Kong bank account into a crypto trading exchange/app to trade cryptos and I would then like to withdraw the money back into my account. Until now, I've checked out the popular names in the game such as Coinbase that support Hong Kong as a country/region but doesn't allow me to link my bank account for transfers. It only allows for crypto conversions. I've also checked out Binance, it supports sending payments from a Bank card (visa/mastercard) into Binance (with a 3.5% fee) but then doesn't allow for any sort of withdrawal method into my Hong Kong bank account. I am almost certain all of the information above is true. Basically, I would like to trade cryptos from Hong Kong and would like to be liable to any taxes in Hong Kong and not some place else. Can someone please help me figure this out? Any help is much appreciated. Thank you in advance.",1

1615834114,"The problem with these things is that there is no liquidity. So you think “high gains moon lambo ritch” but the truth is your being fooled. Simple example: 4 people all own 1 coin of only 4 in existence.  1 guy “buys” his From his other wallet for 1000$ (Basically making a fake transaction), this means that this guy just decided the worth of the coin. If he would have picked 1000000$ then that was the price set. Now you heard about coin X and that it’s presumable going to moon and make you rich right. So you go to an exchange and buy the coin that just pumped from 5$ to 1000$ leaving you with 1 coin of the guy that fooled you into believing it’s worth 1k$ and leaving him with your 1k$... good luck finding another fool to buy that coin from you.. Anyway, you want to sell since you recently found out it’s a complete scam right. So you put your coin up for sale for 1k$. But nobody wants it, so you lower your pricepoint and since there is no liquidity you can’t sell it to anyone because your worth will tank to 0 in just a second. Compare this to BTC where a sale of 1 million will not even cause a ripple.  TL;DR dont buy low liquidity coins unless you REALY know what they are trying to do and wish to support their project.",1

1615832848,"Yeah I’m not a novice but thx for responding. Had some time to check it out and there’s a bunch of red flags.  1) Team of 2 2) Tokens are distributed but you don’t actually own them yet. It’s basically a database now. This I’m not 100%sure because the 3rd point is a definite red flag for me 3) Everyone who tries to grab these coins is doing it for one reason and one reason only, to sell them. This chain or future chain is basically giving out tokens to everyone in some sort of pyramid scheme system. Only friends of friends can register,  people are basically doing MLM work for them and hooking up others with “free coins” sales talk. This coin is going to get pumped and dumped so hard you don’t wanna know. Selling pressure +1 indefinately? O and are people still falling for that PHD kindof talk? Dude ‘s got a PHD in this or that as if a PHD is a safe ticket from scams or moneygrabs.... 2017 vibes anyone?

1615869239,"In my uneducated opinion.. Stay away from Doge for your first investment.  Find something with more use and value. If you are looking for a lotto ticket, there are a lot more relevant coins to look into.  At least 10 mentionedin these threads.   That being said, Doge was the very first coin I bought.  But that was back in January. I still own a small bag.  It's just not exciting and honestly I don't feel has much upside short term, if at all.  If you want to throw a little scratch at it later, I'm sure it will be reasonably priced.   ADA is decent and at a lower price than Eth.  You get more coins for your dollar.  While mathematically, that makes no difference, if ETH grows at a higher percentage but I think as someone new to the game it feels more exciting.   Long term, you can't go wrong with Eth.  I think of it as a retirement investment. It has less of a potential to skyrocket compared to some newer ones but long term, with its BIG head start, it will probably be more valuable than the other two. I own all 3, along with ENJ, MANA, VET and a big bag of Hoge.  All for different reasons. Basically I'm a hoe tho.  Hope that was helpful.",6
1616006355,"According to forecasts, it will most likely go up",1
1615835413,"First off : my math was a mistake , 0.10$ to 60$ is 600x so 1000$ would be 600,000$ not 60,000,000 🤪  Thanks . I understand the chart hitting 18.72$ and 60$ in a 1 minute candle alot better now . I've posted this on multiple threads looking for multiple opinions and now learned that pre-sale price was 0.10$ and GP launch price was 18.72$. What I am more interested at is the time frame this occurred.  I managed to buy at 27$ 04:30 EST and at one time reached 46$ 4:45 The 5 minute candles show it all occurred in 15 minutes and immediately plummeted back to 35.    Like I said I'm new to crypto and was my first Launchpool i jumped into so I was just riding it to learn but a well timed sell would nearly 3x the investment in 15 minutes. From what I see , the drag out of the highly inflated price (30$+) lasted much longer with this launch than previous launches and the second spike made smarter investors than me alot of money.  Likely due to the high influx of unknowledgable investors ?",1

And these guys aren’t retard either, you turn 50$ into 100$ and saw how easy it was, fomo kicks in and eventually you lose it all. You can say you take out your initial investement and try it but number say that traders are usually on the wrong side of the table. They know perfectly well when to hype people and when to dump on them. Bitconnect made some people money, but facts are that 99% of people who trade lose money. You think you can beat the odds, knock yourself out. But please don’t pull in friends or other because you “won easy money”, not saying that you are. But that’s how it works.",2
