1614553249,Read about what they do
1614553250,BTC doesn't seem to move much so tonight I play a bit with ETH. 👌🏻
1614553270,Good luck
1614553303,Thanks
1614553315,"Oh now you're moving, Bitcoin? When I start talking you down"
1614553461,That's why I mentioned it right on the dip
1614553759,ADA HODL
1614554471,I put a stop loss on ada at 1€
1614554483,Because of the damn chinese
1614554651,Its unlikely for ada to go back to 1
1614554740,ill be happy to buy some for 1.  As i plan to hold.. 50 cent more or less would not make a difference in a few years.
1614555873,How do binance get funding fee from me if i dont have money left on my futures account ?
1614555966,i'd save this message to remind myself in 10 hours
1614555974,just in case
1614556119,"Do you have open futures positions, though?"
1614556150,Yes i do
1614556175,BLZLong from .15 xD
1614556282,how risky it is to set a futures contract like 30%  above/below current price? does it need some daily fee to maintain it? (perpetual ones i mean)
1614556287,"or, well, can you do it?"
1614556317,"havent got to futures yet, just read about long and shorts"
1614556784,"Then they take that from those I guess. Funding fee goes peer-to-peer, Binance doesn't get anything from it."
1614556831,"Perpetual futures is easy, try starting with that"
1614556869,"Thanks, I got +157% on that one. Which I subsequently lost to BTC futures. Again. 🤦🏼‍♂️"
1614556882,Easy how? Gimme advice now bro i need to be millionnaire and can spend 1000$ in perpetual now tell me 🧐🧐
1614556905,😂😘
1614556945,"let's say, idk, 1.5 ADA? 😅"
1614556952,It's easy to understand how they work is what I mean
1614557004,I know bro 😉
1614557026,i would do it if I wasnt dumb
1614557032,I lost tousand of $s on futures at the beginning
1614557039,then after i've earned tousand of $s aswell
1614557058,Green candle for weekly
1614557060,bitcoin
1614557154,I shared about XDC weeks ago
1614557169,
1614557180,Hope some of you got it
1614557224,I don't have fiat love 😦
1614557359,
1614557596,What do you guys think of vidy?

1614563212,Nice!
1614563688,Thanks
1614564681,Mmm i have some 6500 STPT i bought once. Anybody got any info on it. I think i bought it on a signal once and it has netted a good 150 bucks profit on a 100 buck investment. Currently have a sell limit at 2 x but honestly i know jack about this project.

1614566917,ok i bought nearly 50 nano less goo
1614567083,Wow
1614568037,whos watching this mary hard fork thing
1614569983,"I have a crypto-fail story for everyone, to you know, show you that there are off days as well as good days and that the point is to CARRY THE FUCK ON."
1614569993,I tried to scalp ADA the other day when it was surging.
1614570029,"my sell order didnt go through, I didn't realize. walked away, damage done, 4 hours later I was sitting at about a 30% loss?"
1614570045,"those who know how I trade, I always use stop losses. 30% is UNHEARD OF for me."
1614570055,"so, for the first time in history, I became a bag holder."
1614570104,"what does one do when that happens? You analyse the chart, plan for the next movement, either get out right then and there, or if there is a good chance for something like a dead cat bounce, time it, exit with reduced loss."
1614570129,"which i what I did, i mitigated a 30% unrealized loss into a 10% actual loss"
1614570141,but it took over a day. at the time it was worth it.
1614570157,"moral of the story, always use a stop loss, dont be afraid to take the L, you can always make it back next trade."
1614570180,which is what I did. I took that bag and did this with it immediately after that mess
1614570188,
1614570211,this is almost 10% gain in one trade about an hour long.
1614570228,"so, almost break even, in no time in a shit market day like today."
1614570232,its possible. learn.
1614570250,"listen to your post grads, watch tutorials, read manuals. PAPER TRADING IS YOUR FRIEND."
1614573895,the fork hasnt even started yet?
1614573938,my exchange is disabling trading in 7hrs
1614575036,how do we feel about tryna swing trade auction
1614583902,The mary hard fork update will be finished at 21.45 utc
1614584250,How many hours is that away? In a different time zone
1614584296,https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc
1614584421,So just over 13hrs
1614584470,Pretty exciting.
1614584603,Will be interesting to see how the price reacts. I think a lot of the pumping in the last few days was caused by people anticipating the fork. Some are betting on a dip while others a surge. I'm leaning towards a surge and obviously followed by a correction shortly after. But a new ATH and a higher point of resistance
1614584612,Of course entirely a gut feeling on my part
1614585436,My math says 14h. But yea exciting!
1614585589,I wouldn’t expect any further price movement related to the fork
1614585683,"I don’t expect it, but there’s potential for growth from where it is given it was 1.47 couple days ago."
1614585709,ADA has rallied because of this fork already
1614585742,"Sideways or down I would say, unless the market in general surges"
1614585771,Hit 1.53 didn’t it?
1614585788,"Expecting nothing major, I'd think everyone who knows about it has made their moves already. But then could be lots of expectant eyes staring at the candles"
1614585801,1.488 is it’s highest point
1614586163,Any news on unifi dao? Good long term?
1614590979,i found a bps server with whales
1614591097,suuuuure you did
1614591205,i did
1614591307,Congratulations 🤣
1614592000,How? 🤣🤣🤣
1614592013,Today is a good day to talk shit about the Ada fanboys and girls
1614592018,Eat shit Ada
1614592038,Everythings green except Ada 🤗
1614592084,I cant believe ADA is fucking dead 😢
1614592206,Wdym
1614592212,It ain’t dead.
1614592241,It’s on induced coma 🙂 I’m planing to buy some before it wakes up
1614592318,Guys. Any thoughts on IOTA coin? Any holders? “Little bird” told me it’s going to move and double soon
1614592388,It’s gonna wake up then dip again
1614592435,Good for me to buy on deep. Then stake it and leave it there for some time.
1614592473,What’s ur deep price you think ? Under 1 usd?
1614592596,"ADA dead? c´mon guys, it was under 0.80 € a few days ago, and now that is 1.04 € is dead? 😆  funny enough"
1614592617,I guess you haven´t bought under 0.80€ to say that is dead now haha
1614593139,ada will probably grow to 3 dollar
1614593203,After I buy some for 1ish 🙂
1614593223,after that it will crash again
1614593230,Yeah ADA could do with eating a little more shit so I can buy in again
1614593266,why is everyone hating on ada?
1614593310,I’m not. I just want more of it before it takes off again
1614593320,then you are just too late
1614593320,Ada aint even dead its still hard
1614593329,should have bought when it was below .80
1614593331,Ye I know it was a shitpost
1614593338,Because ppl missed out on the opportunity back in its .4 days
1614593340,😂
1614593344,yeah
1614593350,ADA is just playing dead rn
1614593353,Guys any thoughts on ETH. Any plans for it to go back to 2k any time soon?:) I have a strategy lol I’ll get 1 Eth. That should give me 500 usd more 🙂  mean while I can buy 500 worth of Ada Or Iota or inj coin.  So if those go down. Eth will compensate it. In time maybe but still I’ll be even not in loss. 🙂 if I make sense 🙂
1614593389,when is the mary hardfork again?
1614593420,eth giveaway!!! send 1 ETH and you will receive 2 ETH !!! ITS TRUEEEEEE
1614593422,0x5fef47cdd90152b740cc869ebdd3362ddbac61dd
1614593432,lol
1614593447,Im mentally ready for it to hold 1usd.  Also for@long term holding 20-30-50cents makes no diference as staking ahíjelo cover “loss”
1614593449,Update ends 22;45 utc i heard
1614593459,My man @artetxe_mikel out here runescape gold doubling
1614593467,ah okey

1614593569,yeah you will earn alot then
1614593608,Every little help 🙂
1614593619,;D
1614594033,Correction hasnt properly happened i think
1614594064,"If you get the fibonacci retracement chart, we havent got to 0.618 level of retracement"
1614594092,And i heard in many correction of uptrend waves we should expect a correction between 0.618 and 0.5
1614594109,"Im here since 0.68, so will tank it nonetheless"
1614594177,Im not sure if i have sent an image of it because in another server some ppl asked about ada and cant remember if i did here
1614594190,can you send it again?
1614594236,"In a while, when i can look for it"
1614594261,Also if you enable bollinger bands either at trading view or binance app we still higher than top band
1614594499,U mean Ada price to go down to 60ish cents on correction ?
1614594691,
1614594703,"No, levels 0.618 were 1.05 and 0.5 was 1 usd"
1614594708,
1614594714,Look at the left side
1614594728,I’m very new to it. 🙂
1614594731,Rally started on 3rd when they announced first part of mary update
1614594739,Yeah dont worry lad we all here to learn
1614594747,But I can see that 1 usd is reasonable price to buy some 🤓💼
1614594762,"oh yo wtf, i deadass thought you meant it was gonna go back down to 0.618 😂"
1614594775,mee too
1614594794,Oh no sorry i meant level 0.618 of fibonacci retracement my bad
1614594798,Welcome to wishful thinking club lol
1614594799,Pancakeswap is great for staking rn really need to check it out imo
1614594810,it is bake is also good
1614594815,Only going to go higher 🚀
1614594819,made 100x on bake a few weeks ago
1614594830,It is 👌🏻
1614594859,So 1usd is “stable price” of support resistance (me throwing smart words I’ve learned) 🤓
1614594867,"This denotes most probable resistance and support zones, thats why i say it"
1614594883,"Thats what i extract from my analysis, but i can always be wrong"
1614594899,"But yeah 1 usd is a strong psychological barrier, either up or down"
1614594923,hey where can i send my winnings to?
1614594925,Any thoughts on IOTA coin ?:)).
1614594935,Dont know it
1614594943,damn ok
1614594944,U won 1 eth or 0.50 BtC?:))))
1614594947,😄
1614594986,That was to winning comment lol
1614594991,Send it over 🙂
1614595002,Im really rookie here btw
1614595012,Joined 28 jan but been trying to learn
1614595026,You'll learn a lot too
1614595072,My story.  I had 0.02btc for 4 years lol  never anything else. Now for the last 2 weeks im in bussiness lol 700 Ada. Bit of iota and soon 2 more coin to play with.
1614595138,Part of my learning and thinking. “Guys any thoughts on ETH. Any plans for it to go back to 2k any time soon?:) I have a strategy lol I’ll get 1 Eth. That should give me 500 usd more 🙂  mean while I can buy 500 worth of Ada Or Iota or inj coin.  So if those go down. Eth will compensate it. In time maybe but still I’ll be even not in loss. 🙂 if I make sense 🙂”
1614595258,If you longed btc i'd spend some weeks or months trying to diversify your wallet again for long
1614595270,One guy I know told me. A. Out what u can lose. B. Half on double is the best. So u out 1 usd. Once ur coin double. U sale half get ur money back. So 1 usd u have now it’s play money and what ever happens no hard feeling. That way u more relaxed and thinking clearer.  A like when ur bank grow and u check charts 10 times a day and ready to sale every minute. And 10 min later it’s up again so u go banana 🍌🤣
1614595361,I got Ada from that BTC I had. I planing to change my BtC to coins. Plus bit more cash and play w it h it. I don’t even remember what I paid for 0.02btc 4 years  ago. So I am not attached to that money any more so to say. So im more relaxed to “risk.” 🙂

1614595807,I originally entered sushi for cake @ 280% apy
1614595808,so realistically... the apr advertised won't come to fruition
1614595852,I mean compared to the usual 5% and 10% locked staking
1614595864,yeah thats fair
1614595869,Which also has big fees and delays on stopping
1614595891,This is ran through Binance smart chain low fees and u can exit at any point
1614595904,U can earn from staking on like 15 different coins
1614595912,All with 100%+ apy

1614597728,yikes
1614597746,Please help
1614597938,Do u buy it to sale later for profits or just to pay fees ?  Still not sure how to “take that coin”
1614597991,Which coin?
1614598005,bNb
1614598138,For the fees and its a good coin in my opinion to hold for the moment
1614598143,My opinion tho
1614598164,More worth while than usdt imo
1614598230,What u sale it for later ? Or exchange to other couns?
1614598615,
1614599156,Exchange to other coins
1614599622,Im having a feeling about a sideways ada trend

1614600533,After it was down 600 yesterday?
1614600552,My portfolio barely dropped yesterday
1614600562,Always hovers arojnd 4900 5050
1614600573,Currently 5500ish
1614600577,not bad
1614600614,Bnb unfi. Stpt and ada are nice chunk
1614600622,Bnb to 500 plz
1614600720,I'm almost recovered from this whole dip… If/when btc gets back to around 56k I'll have gained at least 15% since it started
1614600736,Or wait wait until i bought three more. 10 bnb seems like a good hodl
1614600762,dont you exepect a dip in between again
1614600771,till we would go to 56k
1614600874,"probably yes, but I think I now have the strategy and tools to gain even more from that. so I don't really care whether it goes up, or if it goes up and down"
1614600901,sounds like you have a plan :p
1614600919,great I love to sound like that 😍
1614600969,I need like 9% more to recover
1614600971,long ways to go before I can automate it enough so I can simply start hodling and gently adjusting bots
1614600983,So couple of days
1614600987,At least
1614600994,In the best scenario

And 30th-31st Option 2-3"
1614603098,my current thinking is to just go for option 1
1614603312,Actually I´m gonna split in between 1 and 3. To get some mid-term benefit to reinvest in other projects and 1 to hodl 😬
1614603380,but main bag in option 1
1614603751,That's the other option

1614605259,"To me, a rather mid-long term option is coins that are used as a support for other crypto projects

1614605303,still waiting for LTC to do something :p

1614625607,Set stop limit order and wait
1614625666,"ADA is a long term gem IMO. Tonights update could go both ways, especially since a lot of the hype is already in the price. But either way, i will hold mine regardless."
1614625792,How long until the update?
1614625808,Hodl ada

1614628299,download daedalus wallet for pc (otherwise is a scam)
1614628318,"and wether you create one for staking/saving or not, i think you can see the epoch timers"

1614632620,Ada probably going to 🚀 again soon
1614632626,What do we think
1614632629,Totally this is not so swiss to show
1614632631,Now I'll shut up because I'm saying crap in the crypto channel and Xelo is going to be angry
1614632645,from his profile pic.. seems like it..
1614632647,Could go both ways
1614632649,Xelo left :(
1614632658,So if you could have a long discussion on the benefits on DeFi versus old fashion dual pipe transactions
1614632664,That would be perfect to hide my mess
1614632672,😂
1614632678,At least your a funny
1614632678,wjy?
1614632682,why?
1614632688,Huh?

1614632695,All your profit goes straight back to Swissborg i reckon
1614632700,No idea. They are gonna post a explination
1614632707,So we're just a bunch of morons with no leadership now?
1614632707,So smart my bro
1614632723,Swiss is already in the adoption phase
1614632736,"True question, is Swissborg Swiss ? I mean you have to wire the money to an account in the UK so I was wondering 😄"

1614632985,"I got a small bag a few days ago after I checked it, there´s still room for more 😬  but don´t hope for a lambo 😆 unless you put already half of the money on it haha"
1614632999,But Swiss can say more about 😁
1614633017,He is an early adopter (I guess haha from what I read 😁 )
1614633017,When lambo?
1614633049,To understand swissborg project you have to discover the quality of their apps
1614633065,Understand how they are able to protect token
1614633074,https://c.tenor.com/sDvKOleFL8sAAAAM/eben-driving.gif
1614633081,How they are able to provide btc best price

1614633144,Xelo left? Oh 😦 I'll always hodl the 0.5 NANO he gave me 💔
1614633161,"And have a look on the roadmap,"
1614633170,Tiers one exchange soon
1614633178,More token
1614633192,Honestly i could get like 10k back on my existing house payment loan. I need fiat. Unvestinf like 100 buck on each thing is not big stonks
1614633194,Premium with no fees on transaction
1614633256,is it open for UK ?
1614633256,Not a financial advice you can still follow elon tweet and ask post grad « shall i buy XXX coin now ? When it is the top
1614633273,And as designer I can say their ui/ux is amazing too hahahhaha
1614633284,True
1614633285,web/app
1614633295,Thats why i am sure they are going to attract mass
1614633321,"They know what they are doing on that side too, that´s important for people like me which is interested in crypto too"
1614633333,what the prospects of swissborg tokens price wise?:)
1614633338,that say a little bit more about a company as a big pack
1614633340,Swiss shall i buy swissborg now
1614633348,👀
1614633391,I share here the learn and analysis part they provide for crypto
1614633394,Excellent
1614633395,Tool
1614633403,
1614633406,
1614633409,
1614633582,all that in swissborg app
1614633598,Yep for each token they provide
1614633625,thats fuckin lit
1614633642,
1614633654,Premium was 500$ at the beginning
1614633668,Now it is almost 50000$
1614633693,"Yep, around 37K € :)))"
1614633698,whoa

1614633707,The token price explode and they are based on meritocracy so they want to thanks first comers
1614633720,Naa analysis is free
1614633728,Premium is exchange fees
1614633745,damn
1614633748,premium has between 0% fee and 0.5%
1614633762,normal has between 0.5 and 1%
1614633773,Swissborg bot is able to analyze instant best price on binance vs kraken vs others exchange
1614633791,And the AI is able to find the best path to have the best price
1614633796,If you pay in euro
1614633826,It will be able to check instant if it is better to first buy dollars or eth or any other currency to buy btc
1614633848,But it is more investment oriented than scalping
1614633886,We will discuss on it next time it pump
1614633918,Now 0.89$
1614633930,I am in since 0.09
1614633947,holly shit :))) you are gold now
1614633968,Not so far
1614633980,But i miss the premium low price
1614633995,They are going to release a premium for 5k i heard
1614634052,That sounds more accessible
1614634053,"0,89$ what? im saving swissborg too for future investments"
1614634087,"i think i never saw that pics, looks really promising but should read deep about it"
1614634192,So tonight lets free talk about your strategies guys if you dont mind. I am curious...
1614634217,And also if you have some knowledge on blockchain
1614634243,"I started into crypto in september, since then did a lot of mistakes haha but from mistakes you learn"
1614634291,"Transaction goes in block, block goes in chain, chain gets distributed across nodes, chain is safu, all your base are belong to us"
1614634338,It was a pretty good time for invest in some of the best coin!!! You did miss for sure
1614634361,Ok but what is it in reality with simple words
1614634375,Huge CB and cardano announcement
1614634388,C’est du putin de code a la kon la blockchain !!! Lol
1614634393,"My strategy after 3 weeks starting crypto is to stop following random calls, just get a bag  of promising coins in the medium term, and invest in a few embryos for the long run"
1614634402,Ideally don't touch the coins often
1614634412,"Yeah I did, I had Cardano at 0.08 🤣  sold it when it growth a bit haha as had not really idea about, but I knew it was a good project hahah
also missed big in UNI, had it bought for 3.5$ and sold it for small profit, some months later boom haha over 20$ :)))"
1614634429,Love it you learn fast
1614634433,"Mais clairement, des putains de bits qui se font dl par des pc"
1614634450,"rn just know the basics, trynna learn technical analysis, must make some room and free time to understand about fundamentals to do some longs, but atm i have a tiny bag, started with 100€ 28 jan, now i got around 300"
1614634463,im full on altcoins tho
1614634474,"yep, that was a big mistake I did in the beginning, now trying to keep it as long as possible"
1614634496,"not like i dont trust BTC or else, just i think atm i can make more with altcoins than BTC"
1614634506,"dont have income yet, finishing career"
1614634513,So you are x3 not so bad trust me and you started late
1614634537,I have BTC staked at 14K-18K-22K-26K-27K price :))) since then I haven´t bought more
1614634677,"also learning basics, how works rsi, fibo retracement, trends, trying to combine all together to get better read of the charts
in the beginning had no idea about 😆"
1614634694,"const SHA256 = require(""crypto-js/sha256"");

1614634745,"and searching and reading about promising projects to invest long term, I want to have some bags to hold for some years"
1614634777,So now when you compare bitcoin code and XRP then you know.... end of game
1614634804,I FUCKING GO ALL IN
1614634806,"well, im not gonna lie, i went 100-270 with doge, then used 175-413 with PNT, then went down to 205 or so, spent 20 usd in this paid senior, 14€ in Udemy course (both payments have been the best investments so far), then around 20€ in a gift to my mom for birthday, so i got much lower, around 160. Then, I started taking things seriously, now I'm at 300"
1614634819,"So i could say i made a bunch with luck, but doubled thanks to what i learnt"
1614634828,and thanks to counsel i got here

1614634854,@That one belgian super cunt was sure you will be back 😂😂
1614634896,"Personally.. i don't have a clue of what im doing.. (still learning) but strange enough i’m making money on binance 😂, plus i have a bot running, making me €20 a day, average."
1614634911,Ripple needs a big comeback.
1614634928,@NormanBates love your pic
1614634942,Doge will beat all
1614634947,Doge is my spirit animal.
1614634967,Of course is spirit it is dead
1614635006,But seriously with all this hype maybe Elon is preparing something huge with doge
1614635028,Always hold some Doge. You never know
1614635040,I think Elon is just playing around
1614635056,👑

1614635210,"For sure, i pick it up here and do some further reading on the net. This here is my main source for good advise 👍🏼"
1614635236,Please do not hesitate to ask to the team
1614635256,"Understand for the two first point.
For mid long term why ?"
1614635258,my biggest block is making calls for daily trades ...
1614635276,i am as anyone else looking to make more and faster 🙂
1614635282,Ok you want more calls for daily trade ?
1614635298,and as a noob i am failing to read the signals right ... 🙂
1614635310,"Nvm, I didn't pay enough attention to the text and just read ""no mid long term strat"""
1614635343,"yes that would be very very awsome ... but i do understand you are a long term investor, so i can understand if u cant or just wont do daily or hourly calls .."
1614635367,To be honest i am also good on daily trade but for myself
1614635374,I dont want to share with ppl
1614635385,To risky cuz it is mainly technical analysis
1614635410,When i do that i leave my IT skills
1614635413,i would gladly follow your advices for the daily hourly calls ... since i entered with 5k dollars 3 weeks ago.. after a ton of losses and gains i am at 5k dollars today ... so yea... fml 😄
1614635422,And dont care about crypto techno
1614635449,The market is different from traditional market
1614635453,Day trading to fill up the long term bag is the main strat imo
1614635468,Organic increase is enought to make money on good innovation
1614635482,Daily trade will lead you to leverage
1614635486,Thats the risk
1614635496,I will never suggest ppl to do that
1614635519,I worked in financial sector and have seen friend who lost everything
1614635523,This is bullshit
1614635525,Casino
1614635537,"no leverage for me, i never plan to do that"
1614635546,Better
1614635555,Or if so just manage your position
1614635563,Its all about control
1614635565,Swiss. You are gonna be the reason why i go back to fill my bags with more xrp
1614635568,No emotion
1614635597,Just take profit from ada to feed others bags
1614635622,I promised my fallen comrade that i would hodl ada :virgin:
1614635623,emotion no emotion 😄 3 weeks of trading with big swings in market and in my enter exit positions i am exactly at the same spot where i was 3 weeks ago 🙂 just with countless of hours wasted in front of my pc 🙂

1614635670,🙂
1614635720,would you mind to rate my current portfolio distribution rn just to know your opinion swiss?
1614635731,"anyhow you asked me what are the setbacks, these are the setbacks 🙂 if u can do some daily hourly calls on coins whnever u are smelling it... at least for me that would be awsome, i think for a couple others that like shorter time frame trading as well..."
1614635783,Keep in mind that making money in a bullish trend is not hard. The hardest part is keeping it in the bearish trend
1614635809,i held my ground strong in both directions 😄 just cant seem to walk away with profit 😄
1614635837,In bear. Just tether. Tether is a real stable. Trust me
1614635839,at least not a consistant one...
1614635864,Not really tether i would say lol

1614636010,make a tea and popcorn
1614636010,Definitely not
1614636027,Markets can react weirdly to forks
1614636042,The hype up to the fork can cause a bull pump and then dump
1614636051,it's going down

1614636231,"I'm buying in again at 1,302"
1614636231,i'll be really positively surprised if there's no major dip. meaning that hype building up to the fork retains its confidence in the project
1614636258,what is
1614636271,ada is dipping?
1614636283,no
1614636283,it's already over
1614636294,on route to the moon again 😎
1614636301,thank the lord
1614636303,ADA is a long term HODL for me. So buying right now at any point is a good long term call for me.
1614636318,"doge coin, ada and eth all going up. Life is good."
1614636348,I try to stretch my money as much as I can by buying during the dips but if it goes lower after I buy it I don't sweat cause I'm confident it's headed back up
1614636354,Imagine. If elon takes over the doge project
1614636365,And makes it good
1614636371,adding zero real value but providing a real hype ❤️
1614636379,I bought more at $1.25 the other day and it dipped to $1.15 soon after. But now it's hovering at $1.30 so no stress here
1614636397,bought what?
1614636401,Ada
1614636406,ADA
1614636413,ada is at 0.9
1614636415,wait nvm thats in gbp
1614636423,"Yeah, I'm talking USD"
1614636526,Make a company called cryptoX. Take over doge. Fork it setting a cap. Making it modern and a coin burning reduction
1614636599,Who should we follow?
1614636920,Dev a tool that aggregate all best twitter crypto influencor calls
1614636948,Machine learning on specific words
1614636958,Then feed your buy and sell bot
1614636979,and how their past tweets correlated to rate movements
1614637002,some big data shit
1614637262,I meant that one rando twitter guy that said he knew the BPS coin because he is a insider managed to pump some rando coin up 30%
1614637379,You can track Cardano mainnet tokens from here: https://tokentool.io/
1614637424,Is Ada transactions still blocked on Binance
1614637426,??
1614637767,have you people seen LUNA and ORN ? 😄
1614637939,Do you guys use bots for daily trades ? And if yes why and which bot ?
1614638442,What do you guys think about pundi x ?
1614638468,Personaly bullish on that one
1614638546,I’ve bought pundi a while ago yet to profit from it
1614638556,Token reduction is happening soon
1614640204,"free call for you fuckers in post grad podium, just put it up now."
1614640260,69...Nice
1614640398,Does that mean you will put order again at 0.59 and 0.60s ?
1614640403,Or you will buy from here and try to sell high ?
1614640510,"when i say its got room upwards, i mean over the next 24-48 hours"
1614640527,if you enter right now you might get a bit of a dip before it accumulates and heads up again
1614640537,It?
1614640548,ENJ/USDT
1614640562,Oh ya that was flying this morning
1614640600,i was saying there is still upward momentum on it
1614640652,Mmm. Tempting.
1614640706,What will be your TP ?
1614640716,Like around 73-75 ?
1614640887,"thats a nice conservative TP yes, but i dont want to be stopped out for the multiday upswing so im just leaving a trailing stop in place now"
1614640937,Uuuh if its not gonna be too much what do exactly you mean by trailing stop ?
1614640939,I have no idea...
1614640978,you need a bot for that
1614640998,everytime the price goes up by a certain percentage your stop loss moves up accordingly.
1614641013,Oh and can you recommend me one ?
1614641020,So i can go read and figure it out maybe
1614641037,let me get the link BRB
1614641043,its not free btw
1614641046,the one i use
1614641058,Send me i'll look hope they have trial or w/e
1614641062,I go smoke brb
1614641259,Im back
1614641350,"hey so here is the link, if you use this link you get a discount and i get a bit of a perk, i recommend this platform its quite good."

1614641430,Ty
1614642516,@Sausage Destroyer thanks bro this is appreciated
1614642531,I'm a woman not a bro.
1614642585,ty woman 😄
1614642892,Can you share me your bot please
1614642896,This is so fcking complicated XD
1614642931,Check cointelegraph for the article on matic 🔥
1614642984,"its not really a 'bot' like, its part of their trading platform, when you enter your trade from their platform you enter the trailing stop loss there too"
1614643008,and that platform then continuously adjusts your stop loss to make it 'trail' so you dont have to keep doing it manually
1614643026,ooh i see i tought you were using a bot like auto trades for you
1614643034,the bot function on 3 commas i dont know anything about i dont use bots they are weird and dont work as well as human analysis
1614643042,"no, auto trade bots are shit"
1614643059,still cannot compensate for human intuition.
1614643081,they also are incapable of making mid position adjustments which a human can.
1614643130,"for example, if you enter trade and its going well but suddenly its now very volatile, you can cancel your trailing stop manually and just place it really low to wait for the volatility to settle, bots are too dumb for that kind of analysis"
1614643197,I see i figured it out about trailing stop on smarttrade
1614643202,this is good ty so much again
1614643307,the world is not anymore the way it used to be.

1614645028,Stock channel doing a nice summary on Cardano (ADA) for any who don't get why everyone is hyping it up. Plus stock channels doing videos on crypto is a very good sign for exposure and helping make it more main stream accepted https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbvNMSb7Gc
1614646223,well shit lol
1614646238,ada dropped big
1614646249,imma buy brb
1614646285,Big drop then recovery lmao
1614646285,Look at the 1d chart
1614646293,Look like a pattern to me 😂
1614646319,Might jump back in Ada idk
1614646334,caught it at 1.22
1614646335,decent
1614646352,I think we’ll see it dip under 1.15 again at some point this week. Gotta be ready to catch the dip though
1614646371,Ada has been a stinky dump for like 4 days
1614646374,Because it will jump on Saturday again
1614646386,why
1614646464,But I thought there was something big on 1 March for Ada nah ?
1614646472,Everyone was like wait to see 1 March
1614646548,"There was a hard fork today, but seems like most of the movement came a couple of days before as everyone anticipated it"
1614647181,Any very risky coin that can x10 within months ?
1614647393,How Ada jump from 1.255 to 1.21 in 10secs 😦
1614647428,And now futures closed
1614648206,Jumped up the last two saturdays. If the pattern continues it will do so again
1614648215,"Saturday my time that is, Friday American time"
1614648281,if there was any coin we knew would X10 we would all be in it
1614648322,Oh that’s why I meant very risky ^^
1614648333,It could also go to 0
1614648387,any rando low value shitcoin is potential to do that
1614649284,most of the top 10 will x10 with enough time
1614649367,last message before signing off and doing my own thing.  love you guys!  it's been fun!  starting my own server though.  i'm sure you'll find it when it's ready if you look hard enough.  ❤️

1614651787,"""Ada this,ada that.""   Ada to zero"
1614651814,why don't you short Ada?
1614651829,Ada shorting me
1614651834,go for any leverage you're comfortable with
1614651839,They ask if ada goes to the moon or to the ground
1614651843,They dont ask hows ada
1614651880,@Drahnreb i dont really understand the concept of shorting a coin. By what means?
1614651891,betting that the price will lower
1614651921,"Hard to do that with my money in it, no? 🤣"
1614651968,"Borrow another's coin to make whatever you want, sell high repay low, buy low repay high (you get difference, either winning or losing)"
1614652006,What platform is used to do that?
1614652054,"You got 20 bucks, you are able to use up to 200 at 10x leverage, up to 100 at 5x, you know how maths go"
1614652062,Many i guess
1614652069,Binance lets you
1614652087,"But its risky, only tried once and run with my 0.55€"
1614652101,After trying one short and one long
1614652124,Within minutes
1614652170,Just frustrated.. got into ada at the wrong time apparently
1614652186,Which price
1614652195,Too high
1614652197,Lol
1614652255,"At ath may i guess? I personally think ada will go back again at his ATH, just give it enough time"
1614652278,Project is going well
1614652286,Not quite ath but not too far off
1614652331,"If you in it for long, i'd keep it cool"
1614652342,I buy weeks ago some bnb at 60
1614652356,Then bought a lil more at 139 and 145
1614652370,But sold most of it at 120 when it went sideways
1614652379,Yeah its def a time factor.. my patience needs work lol
1614652385,"Ant there you have it, an ATH of +300"
1614652413,What went wrong with ada today ? Wasn’t the mary fork meant to be good news for ada ?
1614652423,It is good news
1614652423,Why are people dumping
1614652435,But you cant really expect a constant hightrend buddy
1614652441,Yeah ikk
1614652445,I wish it goes down
1614652448,Market gotta keep healthy
1614652450,so i buy more 😂
1614652462,I bought at .50
1614652522,"Try to not overthink it, and if you worried about the money, set a stop limit at like idk, 0.6 or 0.7 in case a disaster takes place"
1614652532,Or more if you want
1614652544,But not too higher than 0.9
1614652583,I *personally* suggest that but i may and probably am wrong so do your own research
1614652605,True that
1614652614,Thanks for the tips bruv
1614652754,Anyone’s opinion on litecoin ?
1614652771,Check the #📈trading-101 #🔤crypto-101 if you are rookie bud

1614652792,HODLST SAving token!
1614652914,"Been doing stocks, but am trying to learn more about crypto ..thanks"
1614652917,"Don’t stress about ADA, it will have its dips and booms like the other coins as the hype train comes in. If it keeps delivering on its promises it will uptrend."
1614653107,"Yeah, im sure you'll get back on the green 😉"
1614654076,@seven eleven i like how you think.
1614657723,Anyone recommend swapping 20% of eth portfolio into BNB
1614660255,I dont really understand the use of bnb if not free fees
1614660989,The Binance smart chain
1614663605,"I understand why people stress as they’ve bought at much higher prices than I did. That said, the principle is the same. ADA is here for the long term and has done what it has said it would thus far. If it stops delivering on its promises, then that’s the time to jump ship."
1614667871,Guys! ADA???
1614667898,@Post Grad
1614667912,Whyyyyy  😫
1614668072,"Buy the rumours, sell the news"
1614668116,ADA?
1614668148,"Yes, but it’s just a small correction right now"
1614668617,every dip of ada is just that. a dip. what tends to happen after a dip
1614668739,Do we expect it to go under 1.18? I have stop losses there
1614669074,I don't put stop losses on long term holds for that reason
1614669540,could see 1.10 at some point in the next day or two tbh
1614669545,depends on how it goes
1614669549,while i sleep
1614669937,Damn I need 49870 more CHSB tokens to be Premium
1614670091,1.21 is the 7-day MA. It's been going up sharp for a weeks now. Can't always moon.
1614670112,I would start to worry when it comes close to $1 again
1614670168,"Hello!!!
You think it will go down till 1.18? I have a stop loss there"
1614670246,This would be 8% loss for me @SeineJanie
1614670438,Do you wanna have that 8% loss?
1614670589,It will definitely get there I reckon.
1614670603,I predicted as low as 1.15 yesterday. Could go even further
1614670630,Not if you hold it for a few months at least 😁
1614670725,Got 10 ADA today for the last epoch. Pretty damn good for staking!
1614670729,"at the prices we got ADA in the past days and we get with the dips, in the next months it will be a win-win situation 😉
In September got it at 0.08€ and sold it for a few cents more later."
1614670752,And if I look back it was not worth selling it for a few cents more :)))
1614670865,"I know everyone wants to do ""daily trading"", but if you do it so, keep a part of the bag (if it´s a good project obviously, and not only a hype) for mid-long term. Those gains will multiply the ones you get in daily trading with the same coin 😀"
1614670919,"Would be a win win for those buying it low. To do that, i need to sell it and buy it low. If we know its going to dip, then the only sensible thing to do is to take the loss, and recover it when it dips furthur. Its currentrly at 5% loss. I reckon it wouldnt be a hassle to recover that buying it low"
1614670997,@SeineJanie What do you think?
1614671027,"Exactly, but specially ADA I guess won´t be easy to predict now, specially that after yesterday´s update could have happened 2 things, and it happened the one which anyone wanted :))"
1614671045,"Well, anyone who already bought cheap 😆"
1614671056,and the ones who bought expensive
1614671065,the ones who didn´t bought wished for this dip
1614671071,and they got it :))
1614671234,"Personally if I believe in a coin, I tend to buy more when dips (because I want to keep it for mid-long term) and get a better average-price entry

For daily trading I don´t recommend that, can dip even more and you´re basically fcked. But that´s just personal expiriences. I personally experienced it in the beginning :))"
1614671315,Oh i was planning on keeping ADA long term. Was expecting a pump when it hard forked so added more funds to binance for it. Thats where im at now.
1614671339,1.28 at the time was the dip
1614671501,"Yeah I hoped for a ""pump"" too but it was too ""pre-pumped"" haha by the people and hype the days before.
I got my bag at 0.79€ and if it goes somehow again to 0.90 I´m going to buy more"
1614671588,"The further dip happened while I was asleep, but I had applied a “short” strategy on Tradesanta so it proceeded to take profits and buy back lower all night"
1614671620,How does Tradesanta work? It is worth?
1614671640,I think I’ve seen this in stock market a thousand times where good news when they are expected cause people to take profits
1614671676,"Yep that was what I thought the days before where it was so ""pre-pumped"" but well, that will allow the ones who want long term profits to buy more 😁"
1614671907,"[No financial advice of course but] I think I’ve learned to use Tradesanta so it softens dips and takes advantage of peaks that occur when I’m away. Also if you’re not careful it can soften upward curves and take profits instead of hodling, if that’s what you’d rather do. But depends on how you set up the strategy — atm I’m finding it a great tool to account for my own stupidity 😁"
1614672092,"Cuz I would be interested to use some €€ to let a bot play around with after setting some strategies. so atm I´m checking different bots, like 3commas too. Thanks for the feedback on Tradesanta 😁 appreciate it ✌️"
1614672389,"I have no crystal ball to tell you either way. It **could** go there and you have to decide how to deal with it. If you have a stop loss set there, you probably don't want to lose more than 8%. If it hits you have to decide, what you're going to do afterwards. Re-enter lower? What if it dips just a bit, then rallies and you're out?"
1614672426,"So i was planning on selling, and putting an OCO at $1 and at $1.24"
1614672430,Is that wise?
1614672449,OCO buy order i mean
1614672477,sounds good... although $1 flat might be a bit low
1614672500,"It tends to get crowded around these ""special"" prices"
1614672623,Sold. What price would be good for buying under? 1.1?
1614672626,"Yea I think I’ll end up allocating a portion of my bag for a strategic bot like 3Commas or Freqtrade. Tradesanta is different to those in that without using Bollinger or rsi it’s super aggressive, it starts trading right away and at small take profits and repeat order percentages (0.5–1%) you may end up with dozens or hundreds of trades per day. As long as the prices stay in the range (ie the strategy you picked is accurate, which means you picked long strategy and the price keeps creeping up) it just keeps going and trading. I typically also apply a short strategy to the same coin pair if I’m holding a large amount of it"
1614672710,"@Cryptoknight I would wait for a downtrend to manifest before deciding. It's still pointing upwards, so this could very well also be a local bottom."
1614672729,Be prepared to be left at the train station in case the train starts up again.
1614672769,"Already sold though. 😩 

But thats fine. I'd be losing a tiny bit in fees if it starts to rise. Thats all."
1614672804,exactly
1614672811,you will never time the bottom or top exactly
1614672822,You just have to be ready with a plan for every case
1614672833,I'll just put a bunch of OCO's at 1.23 incase its just touching. What should my bottom limit be though
1614672885,Why OCO then? Why not just a bunch of limit buys?
1614672951,"In case it goes up, or if it falls."
1614672977,Catch the train no matter which direction its going
1614673058,"Yeah is exactly what I thought to do too, specially to those coins which I´ve seen volatile lately and also to the ""trend"" ones or ""hyped"" ones which can have easy ups/downs and are tradeable 
But I´m taking your feedback about tradesanta and see which suits better the strategy I want to follow! Thank you again ✌️ 😬"
1614673214,"Tradesanta's plans are perhaps a bit pricey but I'm thinking of getting the advanced plan for a month or two so I get to test the Trailing Take Profit feature. With that the bot won't sell the coin right away when reaching the set Take Profit percentage, but follows it up and only sells the coins as the price starts going down from the highest peak

With Tradesanta I've given up using stop loss completely, as it takes advantage of dips and tries to sell your coins to buy back at cheaper prices. Also if I want to start investing into a coin I use Tradesanta and usually don't manually buy it"
1614673281,Let us know your findings if there's any interesting results from bots 🙂 Good luck!
1614673299,"So, what to do after your stop loss was hit ... first look at what the market is doing.
1. It's a local dip, the trend is still up: Set a couple of buy limit orders to re-enter lower. Decide on where you want to place them, what is realistic (-50% probably not) and what your risk profile is. If you want to scalp 20%, be prepared that it won't go that low and you'll be left out. Plan ahead for what to do then.
2. Trend is changing, it's going to go down more for a while. Then I would stay out (or short) for a while, until trend goes up again. Because that can rek you real bad if the downtrend continues for days and weeks on end."
1614673384,Makes sense. Thanks. What would your buy back price be now though
1614673391,@Cryptoknight i would try and fine its support levels and put your buy orders just above it . And devide the amount of money you want to invest over several of these supports in case it breaks. But i am an ADA hodl‘er so i will hold no matter what. Next time there will be an hype train i definitely won‘t miss it. We have just seen what a bit of hype does with its price
1614673392,1.1?
1614673422,Yup. Its ridiculous.
1614673444,"On the other hand, yesterday Doge was trending on Twitter, but it still barely went up"
1614673471,Because doge is a meme coin
1614673498,Yeah.
1614673509,It just took people a while to find that out apparently
1614673516,It had it's moment in the light and now not even the dev team giving it some love and the media attention getting it back to where it was
1614673666,"The problem is times such as yesterday when it started dropping. They say never sell on a drop, but i really wish i had"
1614673707,Easy to say afterwards
1614673735,Yup. A lot easier when you're right
1614673898,And a week later it's up 20% but you're out because you sold 😉
1614673937,"You have to decide on a strat and stick to it. ""Never sell on a drop"" is true if you want to be in it for longer. Don't day trade if you want to hodl."
1614673959,Hence this
1614673987,"Always keep the big picture in mind. Down days can be stressful, but it's a full-time job to time exits and entries well."
1614673998,"If you stick to the big trends, you'll be better off in the long run."
1614674024,"But with these kind of projects with a lot of hype and good fundamentals, the worst thing that might happen is that you have to wait for profit or even for a bit longer. It is hard to time these bottoms. Most of the times a support level acts as a perfect bottom, but this doesnt mean it cant break through. Thats why I recommend you to divide your buy orders over different support levels"
1614674356,Oke Trailing Take Profit is what I´m looking for. I´ll check prices and compare them too. I let you know! ✌️
1614674604,Trailing take profit sounds like a pretty ez way to make doshers
1614674671,"Well, i see that only now ADA breaks pattern and is goign slightly up, Guess thats a big FU from the universe"
1614674715,"Unless its getting ready to collapse again, in which case, thanks universe"
1614674784,Keep your eye on ADA though might make a bigove soon
1614674792,Big move
1614675031,What do you mean?
1614675189,"That it probably will pump, I have gone in long with TSL."
1614675301,Why do you say this?
1614675968,"No, that's simply other traders seeing a (perceived, in their view) good entry price and buying."
1614676202,IS that the train about to leave though?
1614677471,LTC started moving  🤔
1614678053,"That's what I see on ADA/BTC
Not breaking its downtrend at all for now, breaking it would require going back higher than 2600 sats and retesting this support"
1614678563,"right, who was the guy telling me to go in on ADA the other day..... 😩"
1614678581,I went into ada and now am at a 6% loss
1614678601,Thanks. Im out already
1614678611,Fucking whales
1614678704,"Me personally positive about ada. And positive that its good investment. it will go 1.50 and more with time. so what ever u lost will recover  as long as u hold and wait  and not scalp 5-10% as u end up lose more.  Also staking it, give extra ada that would also give you that extra money u would safe, waiting for it to drop 1-2cents and then it never does and go up 5-10c. IMHO of course.  as my nana use to say, ""Patience gets rewarded""."
1614678819,"Every coin dips, even the almighty Bitcoin. Good projects will recover and continue to increase in value in the long run. A lot of us think ADA is a good project and will pay off our investments in the long run"
1614678937,slowly but steady is the way really..not hype hype hype UP and then DOOOOOWWWn weeeeeee and nevr up as there is another hype shitcoin   lol
1614679028,"for me  bit of up and bit of down on ada shows its stability, Id be worried if it would go now to 3 usd and dropped to 1 after,,, that would mean whale cunts doubled their money and moved on to next."
1614679144,If you're looking for quick money and can't stomach a red candle then projects like ADA may not be for you
1614679188,I've already made good profit on my initial investment because I got in at $.55 but I'm expecting bigger and greater growth over several years
1614679379,"i dont expect 10-100.. 3 -5 would be good enough for me considering slowly staking would add up to my bug and would give extra profit. say staking gives u 5% a year.. if price go up even 10%  u get  total at least 15% a year profit.. as ur profit adas get staked back and gives u more. Unless my math is wrong. Math is not my best ""force"" lol im good wiht counting money though :godsgardener:"
1614679465,"I wander...  maybe we should create own ADA pool :)? if its worth it. also any ADA stakers who dont mind spare 5 min of their time, I have some questions, I  need bit of help with. so if someone kind enough, please DM me."
1614679471,Bruh paper handssss
1614679503,You literally did this the other day with some other coin
1614679857,Speaking of ADA
1614679894,"If I’m going to be sitting on some for a long term, should I be getting Daedalus?"
1614679914,Like specifically
1614679918,That's where many have staked ADA
1614679948,I would find a pool you like and then make the decision based on that
1614680475,Imagine freaking out this much over a 6% down.
1614680534,like actually
1614680556,Yeah not exactly the type of person cardano is trying to get involved
1614680579,If you’re looking for quick profits then ADA isn’t for you
1614680582,"Bruh how can you sell ADA with loss? unless you don´t need the money for your private life, leave it there, will recover, you´ll win...don´t freak out, panic sell..."
1614680596,Some people are trying to play the crypto lottery
1614680605,It's sad
1614680619,Like watching a new south welshman at the pokies
1614680629,I feel attacked
1614680663,He's done the exact same thing on like 4 other occasions
1614680669,moment theres a 3% drop sells and complains
1614680698,40% pullbacks are nothing to worry about if you are a hodler
1614680718,"i bought ada at 40 & 60cents, still ahead regardless of what it does"
1614680724,and i cant see it ever dropping down to that kindve level again
1614680735,I’ve made 41 ADA from staking so far. Over $65 from doing nothing lol
1614680760,"And as it´s said, DO NOT put money you can´t afford to lose
I bought a few coins just before the big dip happened, had a shit week and couldn´t trade anything as my money were invested already, on last monday or tuesday I was 1K € down, but I just HOLD and not panicked, and now I´m back again"
1614680760,"I was telling my mate to buy ADA at 17 cents, he unfortunately dind't get in until 28 cents"
1614680768,$65 so far :smart:
1614680772,28 cents is still nice
1614680776,pls explain staking and how i can do it
1614680786,easiest way is yoroi wallet for phone
1614680795,for ada yoroi
1614680797,Yoroi is really fast and simple
1614680806,coolcool
1614680819,you move your ada to a wallet then choose a stakepool to stake with
1614680824,is phone app any different to the chrome app?
1614680826,"Yoroi, Daedalus, and Exodus all support staking ADA"
1614680835,don't do exodus
1614680843,it doesn't let you choose a pool
1614680856,"True, and I think the return rate is lower"
1614680861,you can treat staking like a term deposit
1614680864,4.x%
1614680870,even tho its completely different
1614680871,https://tenor.com/view/partridge-i-dont-know-shrugs-idk-no-idea-gif-4529582
1614680881,I treat it like interest at this point
1614680891,I treat it like meth money at the point
1614680907,ur bravery is commendable
1614680920,It's better than any normal interest program since it pays out coin rather than dollar value
1614680936,and its also a higher rate
1614680938,usually by alot
1614680971,So you stake now and get say 10 ADA that's $12 basically right now. But if ADA hits say $10 one day that $12 is now $100
1614680975,73 epochs a year and compound interest every epoch lol
1614680997,and that 10 ada can be restaked
1614681011,compound interest baby
1614681015,It auto stakes in your wallet
1614681033,When you stake you're staking your wallet not the coins themselves so when you buy more it goes into your stake pool as well
1614681033,Because it is delegated despite being a reward
1614681066,So any staking rewards and buy ins you do after the fact all get piled on to build up that interest
1614681156,so what advantage does a stake pool have in comparison to another?
1614681170,why would you not just go for the one with the highest % roi?
1614681208,I will let someone who knows it better than me answer that as I don't want to give bad information
1614681214,lmao fair
1614681228,I think I know how it works but I'd rather leave it to someone more knowledgeable
1614681429,"As cardano is trying to make sure it’s coin is decentralised, the aim is to have staking pools have equal amounts (or as close to) as possible. This generally means the staking rewards will be fairly similar across the board. It all generally averages out"
1614681442,"Oh there is no advantage between pools, So pick your favourite one."
1614681447,so really doesnt matter which one i pick
1614681450,right gotcha
1614681455,They use a lottery system and it averages out to 5-5.5%pa
1614681476,There are charity pools that donate their 'share' to charitys
1614681481,"Just pick one that you like, follow it on Twitter and find out ahead of time"
1614681491,so basically if you're in long in a crypto you'd be kinda stupid not to stake it?
1614681497,correct
1614681500,correct
1614681502,riiiiiiiiiiiiiight
1614681508,got it
1614681510,as long as the coin in question actually supports staking
1614681513,Exodus wallet gives you 4.21% on Ada with a 25 minimum stake
1614681515,yeh i gathered that
1614681546,wow 4.21% for 25 minutes?! what a bargain!
1614681548,yeah don't do exodus because you can't choose a pool (less decentralization) and you don't get full rewards
1614681564,yeh i've already made a yoroi wallet
1614681597,If you are already staking with exodus that's fine to people suggesting it. There are better options out there though for yourself and the platform
1614681609,so how do staking pools actualyl differ?
1614681621,if they're already essentially the same thing?
1614681642,Crypto. Com do 2% over 3 months with a 250 minimum stake
1614681681,that's a bad option
1614681701,@YOTC which account do I set up on yoroi?
1614681710,Shelley
1614681759,"Some are run by big companies like binance and exodus, some are run by people with multiple pools (better but less ideal), some are run by multiple people with one pool (can get messy with ownership) and some are single pool owner operators (fairest and easiest)"
1614681760,I've not been doing this for that long and didn't dare send anything as it only gives me one address
1614681806,"Most have the same staking fees, (you don't pay, just how much they take from the overall reward)"
1614681817,some offer to use these fees to give to charitys
1614681824,some use them to offset the cost of running a pool
1614681887,"When they add ADA to crypto. Com defi wallet, I take it that should be safe for my ADA as it's decentralised?"
1614681906,When I jump back on the train
1614681954,it's safe for your ADA but the staking is meh
1614681964,https://twitter.com/CardanoMDP these are the list of charity pools
1614681998,"I'm up to 2k cro in staking now, also I received my wirex debit card this morning so can now officially draw out and spend crypto. If I send it to my wirex account first lol"
1614682033,ah nice
1614682047,I was trying to get dedalus but it's not on mobile as of yet
1614682047,I thought you meant staking ada on crypto.com
1614682055,no daedalus will never be on mobile
1614682055,Yeah you can lol
1614682061,use yoroi
1614682064,for mobile
1614682078,"daedalus is a full node, it will kill your phone just trying to run it lol"
1614682105,That's why I was asking about the set up
1614682115,7/11 said shelley
1614682130,"I use daedalus, he uses yoroi"
1614682166,Yeah I have done a Shelly account but got confused when I went to transfer last night and it didn't ask for a tag
1614682174,so daedalus is for pc? does it need anything extra?
1614682184,No?
1614682194,Power from the sounds of it
1614682198,I mean you should only need your deposit address
1614682211,and copypaste/qr code that
1614682215,If you are transferring you need to go to receive which will give you a fresh address
1614682222,"well, if it will kill ur phone, the extension i made is that you need to run it on ur pc"
1614682257,"Click to copy it. Go to withdraw from your market (I use binance) withdraw the ADA, and paste address"
1614682258,"I wasn't sure and got scared of losing my funds, as every other wallet I've used asks for the incoming coin"
1614682298,Thought it was best to ask in here first rather than make a costly noob error
1614682302,It takes a little while to process the withdrawal
1614682316,So don’t shit yourself if you don’t see it get sent for a bit
1614682320,I was impying that trying to run a full node on a phone would be extreme
1614682349,Best place to ask questions is the cardano reddit. Full of very knowledgable people and helpful links
1614682419,Thanks I was reading a few posts on cardano last night at reddit

1614701908,"As mentioned in the update, the Fantom layer 1 blockchain now uses The Graph and Fantom developers are “now eligible for The Graph Foundation grants.”

Recently, The Graph had announced a list of layer 1 blockchains that The Graph community is planning to support. Those chains or DLT networks reportedly include Polkadot, NEAR, Solana, Celo, and they’re now adding yet another layer 1 chain to this group, which has “been fast-tracked to production on The Graph’s hosted service — Fantom, an (Ethereum Virtual Machine) EVM compatible chain.”"

1614722718,Swiss smash
1614722733,You so funny guys 🤣
1614722742,Hey! I'm IN ADA! I was simply spreading a rumor.
1614722751,"Also, i want to buy it for cheaper"
1614722754,Rumor based on what ?
1614722761,Doge shitposting
1614722763,we love u swiss 🙂 u a good lad 😄 calm down and have a sip of tea and it will all go away 😄
1614722764,That comes naturally from the different approaches we Post Grads take for ourselves. Going forward we'll make more clear what our time frame is for a specific call so you don't have to keep in mind who's the day trader and who's the moonhodler.
1614722769,This dude. He's some big shot
1614722779,@felguerr
1614722780,🤣👍🏽🧐
1614722861,Do you really think ex co founder of eth will create ADA based on excel sheet ?!
1614722877,"yea when we reach that point it can have like a this coin, should reach this point, in this ammount of time... 3 factors for us nubs 🙂"
1614722886,Not based on an excel sheet. ON an excel sheet
1614722896,Worst !!!
1614722910,Be careful they don’t delete the cell with your money in
1614722913,"Sure, but please respect the facts of the rumour"
1614722922,"Yes, ADA is limited to 65536 rows of data. Absolutely plausible"
1614722938,AKA market cap
1614722940,🤣
1614722954,if you knew how many times I’ve seen this in my lifetime

1614722966,Was the event yesterday them creating a new excel file? :kekw:
1614722971,"There’s a million rows, plenty of room for ADA"
1614722976,Off topic of Ada that I hold 1000 coins off.  Any one here with One (harmony) is it worth it ?
1614722983,Sure! You keep getting someone here every 3 days saying this pump server is a scam
1614722984,"Oh sorry, Excel 2013 can do a million rows. ADA will be fine!"
1614723026,Wait till you upgrade it to the latest version😂
1614723032,"They probably still had an active file lock they couldn't get rid of. Excel sheets are not multiuser, only one guy can access the ledger at a time."
1614723052,Dude! Those excel macros are super powerful. I wouldnt underestimate them.
1614723074,Cardano approach is the only project if i am correct for which they didnt had whitepaper approach but shared dev coworking approach from all the technical dev community member
1614723082,I like 2013. The second crypto wave I experienced. I had great success that year. 😏
1614723082,What if it is in Office 365?
1614723112,"Ok. Simple question for you. 

What do we all want? 

To buy ADA at lower prices!

STORY"
1614723118,Love the sentiment
1614723136,Y2K must have been horrible for you
1614723141,good time to enter cardano?
1614723151,Get rich with good investments
1614723160,Only if you have an active Microsoft Office license
1614723162,There's always ADADOWN for rainy days. 😉
1614723164,"And ? Thats the reason to spread fakes ? 
I thougth at least that you were joking but you look serious ?"
1614723181,Comeone man. You cant call me paper hands and then put that in front of me.
1614723191,"Honestly, i was 10% concerned"
1614723214,so... we must short! 😂
1614723219,The logic is stupid as there is no logic
1614723222,I have 3k riding on ADA right now
1614723234,If you believe on ADA the price is still cheap
1614723234,sounds like a personal problem
1614723235,Called you paper hands? Stop loss at 8% below during an uptrend was your idea.
1614723257,It did fall all the way down though
1614723262,Was a good call IMO
1614723262,Check out nem guys
1614723268,fall? ada?
1614723269,If you were real fuckin long term invest you were in ADA since a while
1614723274,Buy high sell low buy higher is the way to go
1614723286,"im still waiting the 0,618 fibo level"
1614723288,All the way where?!?
1614723292,"There is an option to vote if u hold 2,5k of Ada and 70k usda adas give  away.   Anyone got anything out of it for voting ? Worth it.?"
1614723296,"When you consider some projection had ADA at $5 by years end, $1.19 is cheap af"
1614723340,Ok. I had ADA. Then there was a hard fork. Assumed it will go up. So put in more money into binance and put that in ADA at 1.28. Then ADA fell without triggering stop loss. Me > Fucked
1614723365,"Long term, on the daily, ADA is still doing pretty good. It was overbought earlier today so it went more to the middle of the road."
1614723379,I bought more at $1.25 and I'm not sweating it at all
1614723380,Someone said the other day on a crypto show anything under $25 is a steal for Ada
1614723413,Someone is thinking long term
1614723432,Everyone getting into ADA is thinking long term
1614723435,"So you still have ADA? Great! How is that ""fucked""? Or did I misunderstand?"
1614723437,Yes they are and it shows the potential
1614723457,I do. I sold only half at the fall.
1614723477,"Basically, 60% of the ADA i had was bought at 1.28"
1614723478,That's the spirit
1614723490,Ada will always be long hodl and I will be back when I make my gains on enj and cro
1614723503,"So basically, if i go back in at 1.19, i'm averaging 1.25"
1614723513,"if my rookie analysis isn't wrong (which could be) the correction of an uptrend wave from what I have heard often falls between the 0,618 level of retracement and 0,5 when you look it from highest point to lowest point, which here should be 1,05 and 1$. So, it wouldnt surprise us at all if that happens, but can't say sure"
1614723557,"That's what I said this morning, I would only start to worry once ADA comes close to $1"
1614723567,"i got a lil bag right below 1.20 in case it went up again because of the fork, but well, its almost the same price rn"
1614723580,Yeah. And this is what freaked me out. That its a possibility. Lol
1614723614,IOTX popping
1614723639,does popping mean it's going up or down?
1614723655,user your eyeballs
1614723676,"So, I'll try to unravel this. You entered ADA in a frenzy phase when price was probably high on the Bolli band, because it was going up up up. Now it went down a few percent and you panic sold.
Now if you have a lot of time on your hands to scalp 2% or 5% here and there, that's fine. If, however, the uptrend will continue, a better (less stressful, less riskful) approach would be to just leave it there. Take the shitty entry, okay you could have entered lower... made a mistake, but don't double down on your mistake by panic-selling in an uptrend and then fomo'ing later on."
1614723680,Did anyone here buy any coins yesterday before btc started dipping?
1614723745,Yeah. Thanks. Though what i've learned from that experience is to NEVER again make a shitty entry. No matter what. There were plenty of other coins pumping at the time. I just fixated on ADA for some reason
1614723776,"Oooooh.... now I understand. Well, sure. It is a possibility, I didn't say it would go there within a day or two... you will have plenty of time before that. By the time it will go near that price you will most likely see a clear downtrend. No need to panic!"
1614723802,Wrong. You **will** continue making shitty entries.
1614723808,I have a question about ADA and staking
1614723816,"You will never time the perfect entry, unless you get extremely lucky."
1614723822,There will always be a better entry price
1614723826,or exit price
1614723846,"Sure, but theres something to be said about pressing the buy button while KNOWING for sure that its too expensive"
1614723852,What matters is not whether you time your levels perfectly but whether you make profit in the long run.
1614723858,timing any part of a trend is mastering trading and a spoon of luck from what i understand
1614723873,I got 300 adas on order for 0.90p (gbp). Now I have 1k. Already transferred to staking dedalouse.
1614723899,"Yeah, that's just ... I was thinking about writing something about like ""Trade with your head, not with your gut"". Now I will definitely put that together soon."
1614723907,Like you look at most of the coins right now (Alts). Most of them are way above the 100 day MA.
1614723927,"Trade with your head, not because you can."
1614723935,"I have a bit of ADA, I wanna buy a big chunk more and put it in a wallet and long term it. Should I be staking it in that case?"
1614723956,are you in it for the long run?
1614723961,0.013 ADA true story bro
1614723968,Well look at it this way
1614723972,It’s money I don’t need for bills
1614723983,And it’ll otherwise sit in a bank account and lmao interest rates
1614723996,yeah stake it
1614724023,but i'd get some good counsel about a good pool or DIY
1614724040,idk for example how daedalus does the pool rank
1614724047,but mine got rekt from 28 to 142
1614724059,dont know if that matters btw
1614724070,I’m just downloading Daedalus now whilst I read up on things
1614724072,Good point
1614724105,Daedalus or Yoroi
1614724117,"Like I have my gambling money for day trading, that’s separate. If I lose that on some dumbass futures then I ain’t gonna miss it either"
1614724189,Any significant difference that I need to know about? Apart from Yoroi being an app
1614724211,"Mm not reall, exact its an app"
1614724225,I use Yoroi also cuz i can connect it to ledger
1614726228,daedalus takes a while to download blockchain as well so yoroi is just faster/easier setup
1614726333,for me it was like 1h or so?
1614726710,same here. but then it was easy 🙂
1614727006,ada flying just now

1614739755,@IllegalSkillsException why is enj going up so much bro?
1614739854,"Not sure if they are pumping it on purpose, or there is some game that is a lot played using Enjin SDK."
1614739891,It's possible it got attention as a project now
1614739926,what are ur tokens/coins u recommend on investing rn? @IllegalSkillsException
1614740068,I am primarily invested in ADA since couple of months. I usually hold back giving recommendations on investing. I like to give informations to crypto noobies more than giving any serious investment advice.
1614740122,Other post grads who are mostly focused on doing TA (Technical Analysis) can give better advices on short- medium term stuff
1614740428,Enj is getting used in Japan to pay for micro transactioons in mobile games
1614740453,Also to fund new coins and other projects
1614740465,so is going up or down
1614740473,in this month
1614740513,Up as there is no wall
1614740581,hm
1614740790,You know what kids are like for buying things on mobile games
1614741092,"If my calculations are correct enj will slow down when Japan goes to sleep and as it's midday now in Japan we should be good, research for yourself"
1614741287,what
1614741386,"Honestly I research every coin before I put my money in, in only put £8 into enjin the 2 days ago"
1614743482,You all seen rkt
1614743547,@bcdcdaz congrats
1614743749,Cro is about to break it's 5 day high now
1614744089,how did u found out about enj 2 days ago?
1614744093,@bcdcdaz
1614744458,Some business news flashed up about a major breakthrough in the acceptance of crypto in Japan and the legislation allowing enjin coins use in apps and games
1614744573,"In regard to crypto. Com they're about to beamed into the home of every F1 fan in the world, that is mega exposure"
1614744718,how so
1614744723,is there gonna be an ad or?
1614744726,@bcdcdaz
1614744757,No they've sponsored the Aston Martin F1 team
1614744877,I'm getting about £4-£5 every 20-30 minutes tonight
1614745007,Enj just broke it's 14 day high and is pushing for 15 day mark now
1614745299,"lol, congrats!"
1614748949,what are your feelings on BTC? is good to sell now at 50k?
1614750807,In the long run of things? No
1614750914,"Very short term it could dip down a bit more though before taking off, we could see 48k once more.
But 47k was held nicely yesterday for the time being."
1614756292,👍

1614759598,daaang when will enj stopp
1614759650,tfw was gonna push doshers in WINGS 3-4 days ago but decided against
1614759774,"@Cryptoknight do u feel silly bailing on ada after it dropped 6%, if you had've held you'd be up 3-4% now"
1614759900,depends where he invested that funds in
1614759916,if he did a transfer from ada to enj that was a good move :p
1614759918,nah boi has paper hands
1614760026,@That one belgian super cunt did you keep your reef position ? I hope
1614760046,Probably best not to remind the fella
1614760063,54k is good for limit sell BTC? or will go higher this week????
1614760233,"i sold mine 2 days ago, i bought at 120 satoshis and was not going up after the reddit post.. 🤦‍♂️"
1614760248,Shitttt
1614760266,yeah... 47% loose approx..
1614760277,"i only put in 100, but it's big loose anyway.."
1614760305,Hard to forecast the week. BTC was supposed to range between 40k 50k for all this week but looks like no. Will see the daily closure today
1614760322,@steve_maister march full of news for reef
1614760334,It might be really bullish
1614760490,Czh👀
1614760498,Tether printer really boosted BTC
1614760541,"don't tell me this now... 🤦‍♂️  haha i knew it, but also everybody was talking about selling and assuming the loose as it seemed to be a scam"
1614760556,I dont
1614760561,I didnt
1614760569,I didn't either...ha!
1614760577,yeah i know.. u've got diamond hands haha
1614760577,Reddit is full of rubbish sometimes
1614760596,mines are not paper but.. not as strong as yours 😂
1614760603,Wooden?
1614760608,Always keep a eye on roadmap
1614760611,it's been just 2 days man.. i sold at 63
1614760619,If you want to confirm
1614760623,kind of 😂
1614760628,Dont follow those groups
1614760644,actually it was here haha
1614760649,it's the only one i follow
1614760670,"the enj call was so good actually, i did a good 15%"
1614760673,follow only documented calls
1614760687,"just because i wanted to recover some money and sold, and i'm ok with that"
1614760699,or calls of people you trust from their many previous calls at least
1614760744,"yeah i know.. i've lost a lot of calls ofc, just need to make my strategy stronger, as i never know when to collect profits"
1614760845,"just doubled checked, i did put 50$ on reef and sold for 27$, half of it.. but well,  it was my smallest bet i think, it's not hurting that much now 😂"
1614760870,I have so much issues with spreading out on multiple coins
1614760888,I feel like I should have 25% of my money in each coin
1614760917,"otherwise its ""frustrating"" to see things take off"
1614761333,Also saw somewhere that they said reef is a scam (I haven´t bought or sold) but was wondering why they say that :))
1614761376,Someone yesterday shared from a group that Cardano is an excel sheet
1614761381,🤦🏽
1614761418,Just compare REEF roadmap to Doge roadmap
1614761424,And you will have an example
1614761562,For all swissborg holders. I cant 100% confirm but it looks bullish !!!!!!! Normally if you had follow all my fuckin previous calls since january you are near to be rich (or at least with a good profit)
1614761647,"I was briefly worried that people might buy that ada scam rumor and panic sell their ada, so I **extremely strategically** and **not panicking at all** setup a bot with ada/eth pair lol"
1614761746,
1614761891,"where do u buy this one ? i did check a bit and looked promising to make some profit, and u talked a lot about this"
1614762347,the swissborg app
1614762367,Swissborg APP. Ask swiss for a referral code ;)
1614762470,And his address in case it all goes to shit. We'll draw penises on his front door as revenge
1614762523,"Cmoon ENJ fall fall, dont make me feel bad for selling at 0.8"
1614762998,"Yessir, I'm hold on CHSB!"
1614763782,"seems we live in the same city, so will not be expensive to do 😂"
1614763848,Perfect I'll send you some markers through amazon prime
1614763873,Bon @xclicx tu es ou ? Je vais pas me battre en suisse par contre on peut se rdv a annemasse easy
1614763923,"Ah perfect steve, im going to distract swiss by making him believe were meeting in france. Then you go draw penises on his fridge door"
1614763929,Serves him right !
1614763975,I still have my reef position
1614764039,I am starting to get really enough of you trolling @xclicx i am not a child and dont want to loose my time especially in the crypto chan
1614764058,So next step i ll block you
1614764117,Hammered
1614764158,"And #💰crypto-only-chat here please 😀  i don´t wanna either scroll through shit to find interesting (and valuable) info, for that we have frat-chat 🙂"
1614764163,Yeah i still got my reed. Decided to not sell its since eh who knows
1614764217,👍🏽
1614764423,ETH call in post-grads chan was awesome… ADA's been doing good last few h but getting ETH with most of it was a good move
1614764478,I see its up but did something specifically happen that is making you curious about my holding
1614764600,Last time i checked people were going RIP scam.
1614764605,so whats wit ETH expectations? I dont owe any still 🙂 good to buy a bit and hold or yet to wait? it was 2k so should go back to it at some point. 1.5 now.. 500+ to go.
1614764614,"i think eth is one of the best ""secure"" bets, i did not sold even with this giant dip, and will not sell, diamond hands with it"
1614764649,i would hold as much eth as btc you hold if not more 🙂
1614764650,Bags i need to empty are gto. Nebl and nav. Got sell limits set but oof
1614764740,also are your sell limits set to relative to usdt or btc?
1614765099,They were set at 2x satoshi. Which at that time would net 0 loss. I just wanna get rid of em
1614765251,"nice, i was gunna say set the sell in btc denominator not stablecoin"
1614765305,Though honestly might be the wrong way. Who knows. Gto is a ultra shit coin but nevk and nav are decent iirc
1614765310,NEBL rather
1614765369,"Hey @felguerr , I apologize, I thought that you understood these were just jokes, no harm intended (and no trolling either). You won't hear from me again."
1614766163,Oh right i still have FXS
1614766434,No harm from dicks on the door 🚪. More we buried in dicks when we looking for good coin to invest in 😁 u can send him dicks in private messages 😎
1614766905,guys isnt it against binance and other exchanges's rule to not use bots ?
1614766919,never heard it i think
1614766935,how you'd come to this idea
1614766957,It is against there ToS yeah
1614766964,I'm pretty sure that they do allow manual trading as well. 😃
1614766977,lmao really?
1614766984,Using a bot is yeah
1614767117,what do you mean for bot
1614767133,because i thought this API keys were related to allowing bots
1614767355,"It's not against the rules, not to use a bot, no. 😄"
1614767502,"Can't find anything on their ToS about it, but there's dozens of bot options that support Binance API and have the Binance logo on their sites, and some also clearly state that Binance allows bot trading"
1614767553,If Binance provides an API then it makes sense that they allow it lol
1614767556,They have a non-flooding setting so you cannot hit the api too many itmes per seconds
1614767583,but that's pretty much the restriction
1614767656,yea i might have worded it a bit wrong 😄 my bad for that 😄 but i am afraid to use all my money with bot...
1614767667,"yeah there's a limitation, but it's difficult to get to overpass it, just if you're using multiple threads"
1614767683,Just use some and see how it goes
1614767695,and i would rly like to use the bots like 3commas one coz those fuckers got 0 emotion and win every time 😄
1614767706,unlike me ...
1614767721,Many bots offer virtual mode or backtesting so you can trade with demo mode or see how your strategies do with historical data
1614767728,yeah well it do not be like that always man
1614767744,i'd like to try 3 commas too
1614767753,@JLeh22 enj and cro still going 🤑
1614767813,damn enj went really up
1614767814,fucaldat
1614767827,ocean is also doing good today
1614767914,"3commas is really safe to try, it doesn't get into trades too hastily even with aggressive mode. Whereas Tradesanta if you don't use bollinger or rsi eval will start to trade like a squirrel on acid the second you turn it on. But even then you can restrict the sum to minimum which is something like $10–12 per trade (and max concurrent trades amount to 1 or 2)"
1614767988,ADA train coming to station for those who still wanted to hop on…
1614768073,(I personally like the acid squirrel style trading)
1614768601,Ada has broken out of its triangle. It's getting ready for a bull run.
1614768700,ADAUSDT - getting ready for a huge run!
1614768738,We are looking at 1.65 - 1.70 range.
1614768872,My dear BLZ
1614768937,"Regarding the bots, there's an API limit at X requests per minute, so you can't spam the API every ms. However you can poll every ~100 ms with no issues.
Then there are some other limitations, around the number of orders versus the number of trades, which shouldn't exceed a given limit. I guess this is to avoid having grid trading done by bots who are changing SL/TP orders every 100ms 🙂"
1614769446,Planing to hold or sale on profit and re bit later again?:)
1614769564,"I don't hold for long time. I trade to make profit. I have every intention to re-sell at the top, let it drop a little and buy in again."
1614769717,Daamn BLZ looks like a pump
1614769841,Some turkish guy with a 200k follower shared
1614769843,thats why
1614769862,He loves pumping coin which he bought earlier and selling to his followers 🙂
1614769869,Another to watch in the coming days and weeks is chilli (chz)
1614769876,And this is not healthy for BLZ
1614769890,i believe the coin their project etc but this kind of pumps kills the coin
1614770603,I heard from few non hyper sources that IOTA going to make a move soon. Not today of course. Any thoughts on IOTA?
1614770612,For now it seems stable no deeps
1614770846,I also hear the same @TheOne but it wasn't on the Simpsons yet
1614771204,"Okay the supercharger event on crypto has grown from 515,000,000 to 565,000,000 since it opened, last chance before cro leaves for the moon"
1614771338,I bought in a week ago @ £0.0986 they are now £0.1165 and picking up speed
1614771394,Still a bargain anywhere under £1 I'd say
1614771409,Research yourself and see what I see
1614771632,The volume has gone from 400k yesterday to 2mil today
1614771646,Mostly buyers and stakers
1614773711,"Played around with some money (up to lose it all 😆) after @Sausage Destroyer  signal (just by curiosity and also after I checked and made my analysis too - not an usual futures trader 😄)
That was a good one 😁 Thank you hahah 🤘🏼 

Don’t do it if you don’t know what are you doing! After I entered was 5% down for a long time and most of people here would freak out from what I saw lately on the chat !"
1614773981,Jesus
1614774172,btw. SwissBorg now has faster euro deposits 🎆
1614774513,damn gab 😄 is it a secret how much u went in with ? 🙂
1614774627,"""some money (up to lose it all 😆)"" hahaha as I said, just ""playing around"" with. You can´t really know if something happens and breaks down even more so I risked some eur I had left on binance, below 100€"
1614774660,hehe well nice honey collecting u did there 😄
1614774663,gz mate :d
1614774688,Gab the good student 👍🏽👍🏽
1614774695,haha
1614774714,this btc is pissing me off for standing still so tall now.... either crash or just go through ffs
1614774720,hahah I´m trying to
1614774737,the suspense...
1614774800,Pulled out a bit early didn’t you? Where’s the diamond hands? 😂
1614774850,hahaha
1614774852,shut up ! 😄
1614774877,"profit is profit haha and I did the money I wanted to buy some CHSB, so now with the faster euro deposits on SwissBorg I´m gonna buy more CHSB"
1614774892,aaaand finaly... seems its going through...
1614774898,I’m still in at 20x 😬
1614775191,They improve the bank transfert thats why the price pumped a bit
1614775310,eth mooning 😄
1614775496,"Yeah saw it, good news 😬 so wanted to get more today. Really love how they do things, so I want to have a bag here too for the future"
1614775605,BTC goes up so and the rest with it...  are we expecting some deep again.. time to sale and re buy later? ( dont have any btc personaly)
1614775608,Already got at 0.73-4 € so now is still in time to get more haha $CHSB
1614775633,oof
1614775641,eth goin for a run
1614775660,4% in 20mins
1614775663,@felguerr I sent you something
1614775693,Ada recoverying
1614775756,everything is just following bitcoin
1614775763,and bitcoins been goin ham for the last few hrs
1614775793,only MDA not 😆 fck hell haha I have a bag there and I need it even higher to get something haha
1614775812,MDA did better before the run now haha
1614775930,"You bring an interesting point, I believe that on coinbase, they tell how what is correlated to what"
1614775939,"From what I understand, MDA is correlated to ETH"
1614775946,96% of moves are similar
1614775973,CHSB however does not follow BTC or ETH
1614775980,ETH did good this morning so MDA too
1614775987,(It would apparently be closer to Uniswap)
1614775991,but now last hour was a shit one
1614775998,these chinese guys are crazy how they push btc up 😄
1614776051,this could explain the shitty week MDA had cuz ETH was down too
1614776120,"went from 1€ to 0.69 I guess at some point, or even lower, exactly the same time ETH went from 2K $ to 1.3K"
1614776145,"Then obviously this is only past data, a coin get probably get out of the correlation after some specific news"
1614776178,"Imagine MDA gets chosen by Youtube as a payment option, the correlation to ETH disappears in thin air 🙂"
1614776197,Any dip I should buy atm ?
1614776234,Definitely
1614776239,"ADA  seems low, but I don't know if it's a good buy"
1614776280,I had a market entry point at 1.16
1614776288,"it was 0.98€ yesterday, 1.04€ was quite  strong in the last days"
1614776295,i hope ada goes bit dow to buy more 🙂

1614776622,Apparently US people also got their covid stimulus check
1614777142,probably all goes in to BTC .. so and the price up.
1614777459,We have not
1614777498,They are voting on it this week at our senate then it goes to biden. The prediction is 2-3 weeks from now
1614777636,Cool so by the end of March price up for coins expected :))
1614777888,OK so rumors are unfounded then
1614777891,Thanks!
1614777926,No problem!!!
1614778225,This pump is due to Tether turning their printer back on
1614778485,Its not exactly that. There has been a fight at the 50k mark because of F2Pool trying their best to keep it under 50. They have been holding it under 50 for the last few days. They are also part of the reason for the major dip we had
1614778517,"Im sure the tether printer helped but one entity no matter how rich, cant hold back the entire world of traders"
1614778525,Have f2pool really been dumping enough to affect the price? I also saw posts on this but i thought they were wrong
1614778540,F2pool? What is that?
1614778546,Yep. They have been dumping tens of thousands of btc
1614778572,Its a large mining pool that apparently has a bunch of BTC
1614778599,When I looked into it they seem to dump every month and this time didn't seem like much different
1614778616,Sounded weird if it was a staking pool
1614778687,There is a pretty good youtuber that analyzed the btc coming out of F2Pool. Ill send. Keep in mind though that this youtuber is quite biased and is VERY bullish. I wouldnt buy his calls but listening to his data is informative
1614778742,https://youtu.be/3M8TnryxAsA
1614778748,I already looked into it tbh. F2pool dump 10000+ BTC every day and have done for ages. They normally do it slower when the price is rising that bit is true.
1614778792,"As a general rule of thumb, you should NEVER buy a youtuber’s callout. Most of them are overly bullish ignoring very bearish factors"
1614778817,This is more than likely due to them having positions in the crypto they are pushing. As always DYOR
1614778950,reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lq32rh/psa_this_dip_was_most_likely_caused_by_a_3600_btc/
1614778959,^^ this is nonsense
1614779190,Enjin is at full power
1614779305,Man i should have put a bag there
1614779316,Hahha
1614779401,Told ya lol
1614779424,Not too late it's going to be £20+ this year
1614779444,Im trying to do day trading instead full long
1614779450,Lets see how it goes
1614779454,My long is ada only atm
1614779467,For that price tho look at the mark up
1614779474,"Btw, what do the colour of volume chart means?"
1614779491,I've been thinking about it
1614779494,And im not sure
1614779494,Red sell and green buy
1614779510,Yeah but volume means the whole volume moved in that period
1614779516,Either sold or bought
1614779542,I suposse is last red candle
1614779547,"Thing is, does it means the candle of that period went up or down?"
1614779551,After this candle go up
1614779596,
1614779599,For example this
1614779616,I think this could be it
1614779658,But been thinking for weeks it meant it was the volume of sell orders if balance of period was negative
1614779674,Or buy orders if was positive
1614779678,Idk why i thought that
1614781369,Enj hit a dollar
1614781436,"I am doing a deeper dive into π (Pi Coin) currently at an early stage but seems to be gathering miners, could be a interesting one to start mining then fuck off with profit as soon as it's get announced on an exchange, as it doesn't really offer any real benefits (like Nano, ETH etc) have been using my phone to mine for a few days and it doesn't seem to impact battery too much (1% of total usage) but seems you can get a fair few by creating a a bigger circle"
1614781461,"I'm not going to shill my link here, but if anyone is keen to look at it, I can send you a link"
1614781626,$1.15
1614781664,$1.20
1614781672,1.30
1614781706,rofl did u see what enj did ? 😄

1614781718,fucking crazy shit 😄
1614781741,my sell order was stupid in retrospective
1614781754,mine as well bro... no1 expected this 😄
1614781759,this was off the charts 😄
1614781808,I did predict it
1614781809,same ^^sold way too early
1614781831,"i knew they were aiming for 1, but 1.27 no ..."
1614781928,Oh wise one! what the price to expect? do we need to buy more?:)
1614781946,i got in at 0895 and when it hit 0.92 i was like yea baby 😄 and then... 1.3... fuck baby 😦
1614781946,thank u be way. it gave me 10 USD profit 🙂
1614781955,It will stabalise in a min
1614781975,tbf @bcdcdaz has made some great calls in this chat over the last few weeks
1614781981,it still ging up!
1614781990,im 11 usd plus lol

1614782274,never be sorry on a profit 😄
1614782279,thats what i learned 😄
1614782282,Very true
1614782444,but so hard to time the correct top
1614782455,if it only lasts a few minutes
1614782465,a bot with a trailing stop loss could handle that i guess
1614782538,Thanks bro
1614782668,:virgin:
1614782752,is there still juice left in ENJ now?
1614782764,does it make sense to look for an entry point again
1614783025,"Any predictions on btc price, is it going to rebound?"
1614783222,why not? let it settle - do some TA and then reload -no reason why it wont o back up - good project!
1614783254,there is kinda no reason why you wouldnt look for something if you are curious about it
1614783275,"if you think theres an entry point in ENJ (which there will be eventually), then yes, it makes sense to check"
1614783288,"if you dont think theres one, it makes sense to look at it to confirm ur suspicion"
1614783391,Yea I looked at the project already
1614783404,bro poli pls
1614783413,pls let me buy crypto
1614783423,but this is really buying into a green candle :p
1614783457,and it must be overextended like crazy
1614783655,I now proclaim enj as the chuck Norris of coins 💯🚀🔥
1614783670,atm i am interested in auction and xvs
1614783711,Ada sims stable... good price to buy more?:)
1614785186,👀👀 hit me wit it
1614785190,Since when NFTs became so popular lol. I see celebrities starting their own collectibles and want a slice of that money making cake
1614785194,Enj is about to blow again
1614785203,Its literally an oversaturated market rn
1614785268,"Is already went up high enough, i think we could expext some retraction now no?"
1614785326,No £20 today
1614785347,"grimes created some ""artwork""; created some NTFS"
1614785357,and made more money then I will ever earn in my life
1614785386,lol I wish!
1614785412,need to set sale ordr asam for 15 pounds. I have 50 of ENJ :))
1614785418,whats all this then
1614785994,And now Steve Aoki
1614786019,On one hand its good for adoption
1614786059,"On the other hand, these artists dont care about blockchain mostly. They just wanna cash grab probably as much as they can"
1614786075,I swear to god its gonna turn out reef is actually a gem that is being hidden by fud
1614786173,ye its really weird
1614786540,what do you think on reef? undervalued?
1614786737,if it was undervalued i think we'd seen some big volume spike
1614786747,let some days pass and we might see
1614787053,So I just found out Atari are using enjin coins 🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀
1614787360,That’s encouraging news but looking at this new Atari console is it realistically going to chip away much as the big 3 console market share?
1614787383,It's used on Atari mobile games
1614787401,Do they have any major games on mobile?
1614787406,In Japan right now
1614787481,LTC has taken over ada in volume
1614787491,"USDT, BTC, ETH, LTC"
1614787494,There was talk of them creating a crypto coin for use on the new console they’re releasing (bit old and retro looking for my wants) not sure if ENJ will get a look in there
1614787520,Maybe it will crossover
1614787542,BAT went up... I sold my at 0.31 lol
1614787550,lol
1614787552,Like buy Nintendo bucks but they're actually enjin coins
1614788101,hi! where's the pump calendar?
1614788110,i was in that server just for that... thanks!
1614788190,It’s having some work done
1614788207,you are only here cuz of Pump Calendar? 😦
1614788245,"not only, but i was interested on knowing those groups and its rank"
1614788268,(english is not my mother tongue..)
1614788328,"high level summary, dont engage in pumps"
1614788341,try to read the group and follow up on organic pumps :p
1614789029,Last call for ADA 😎
1614789054,Sure ? What’s the news ?
1614789103,No new news. It's based on my technical analysis.
1614789144,As I believe it will go up. 1.50 and plus so saving few cents now will not make diference.
1614789150,Goin to buy another 100 🙂
1614789244,anyone uses brave browser?
1614789250,me
1614789256,how do the rewards thung work
1614789261,do ads pop up randomly
1614789267,I’m. And I regret selling Bat now lol
1614789275,specified amount per hr
1614789280,Yes. U can set up 5 per hour tops.
1614789284,up to 6 i think
1614789286,is tops
1614789288,I never took this seriously. Have known it for a few years lol
1614789295,when do they show up?
1614789296,its not serious money
1614789296,What I do. I just refresh page few times. Till 5 adds appear. That’s all
1614789316,do you have to be on a particular website?
1614789320,they show up as a popup bottom right of the screen
1614789323,I don't see ADA as breaking out back again yet
1614789340,"Got me 1K ada @0.8 and hodling, not sure when to sell"
1614789358,never
1614789365,ADA/BTC
1614789371,I have 1k too. Not going to sale. Staking it.
1614789375,hold it til it makes you a millionaire
1614789383,and by hold i mean stake
1614789405,"I really need to take a break. I read ""hodl"", even though you wrote ""hold""."
1614789408,where do you stake ADA?
1614789495,I cant see this too
1614789564,It's close to a local bottom though to be fair
1614789570,RSI is way oversold
1614789585,but I tend to buy on the beginning of the way up
1614789586,ADAUSDT - I Believe it's at a cross road. It needs to decide up or down and I think it will break up.
1614789664,"If BTC holds up, ADA is going to pop up"
1614789681,btc will hold up
1614789683,so will eth
1614789705,btc is trending towards ath
1614789716,yoroi
1614789718,I guess we'll see soon enough 🙂
1614789807,also
1614789812,from a previous conversation
1614789830,using crypto in place of a dedicated local currency for microtransactions
1614789834,is actually a good idea
1614789862,like i at least think thatd be cool
1614789864,yo
1614789868,😄
1614789885,Ive got 10x leverage and a 2% sl on btc
1614789886,we'll see
1614789935,Lets see 😆 ❤️ 💪
1614789961,is the calendar gone?
1614789961,Watching this channel is like horse races. lol
1614789970,long?
1614789979,yes lol
1614790231,to newcomers TA probably looks like astrology seeing how much drawings we put on our charts haha
1614791748,"the only thing i understand why its there are red lines, and maybe green ones"
1614791762,i imagine purple ones are resistances
1614791785,"but you lack some other good indicators i use as MACD, fibos and maybe something else"
1614791790,i'd look at them too
1614792311,Enj blowing again
1614792548,GO ENJ! and Dazz 🙂
1614792950,That Atari shit is killing it and
1614792995,They had 5 major announcements today check their twitter oh and launched on the Japan stock exchange
1614793093,"Should have gotten more then 50. But still, better than notning. Thanks to dazz 🙂"
1614793191,Hey this is going to make us all serious money
1614793272,Can’t retire with 50 enjs. But better then notning
1614793580,im gonna short enj as soon as i see the signal 🤣
1614793837,Enj just broke 1billion volume in 24 hrs
1614793877,The market cap is only 694mil
1614793931,Turn half into cro when they're £100 in a month max
1614794028,Hopefully
1614794109,"Remember they are being bought for games now, each purchase of the coin in a game destroys a coin.
This lowers supply and also demand this raising the price.
By the time t
Atari launch the console they will be able to set whatever price they want for in game items, at least a lot higher than on a mobile"
1614794121,I anticipate a market dip soon.
1614794233,In general or ENJ?
1614794266,The entire market
1614794295,For some reason I think so too.
1614794312,2 mins time most will turn red
1614794315,I got my Ada anyways. Not selling it. Will hold trough deep. No more money to invest anyways.  🙂
1614794694,"No, I bet it will go up a bit more today"
1614794907,Enj isn't stopping £1.02billion market volume today now
1614795045,@SeineJanie I sent you my analysis
1614795063,Anyone got a good source for clown make up? I need some since I sold my enj last night with 18% profit. 🤡
1614795100,Cro is next lol
1614795132,Wait until Japan wakes up tomorrow
1614795139,@Drahnreb I sold it 3 times already
1614795155,Keeps surprising me :’)
1614795181,"Last time I sold at 0,95 and it was like 1.3 5 min later lol"
1614795181,What I'm seeing on these charts you usually see over weeks not minutes and hours
1614795400,In 5 minutes it's gone to 1.05b vol
1614795535,I FUCKING TOLD Y'ALL. IM STILL IN DIAMOND HANDS MOFO
1614795622,why
1614795796,Cause
1614796195,Cause he said so and everyone knows he controls the market
1614796356,tf is enjin even doing
1614796373,It’s just a gaming nft isn’t it
1614796550,you talking bout me?
1614796571,who
1614796600,are you enjin
1614797187,hi enjin
1614797235,Just waiting for enjin to hit full volume 🤣👀👀🤣
1614797377,What's the goal for enj
1614797399,"Its Japanese, sky is the limit"
1614797503,"ETH was a great call, I let the bot work on the ADA/ETH pair while ADA was stalling. So thanks for that ❤️"
1614797750,thoughts on VET?
1614797791,I personally love VET. Think it’s got a lot of potential and is already being pretty widely used.
1614797839,A friend is all in on vet for 2 years now
1614797849,Waiting for it to explode
1614797850,I think its undervalued tbh
1614797856,So be patient :’)
1614797876,"Its sad that CRO coin isnt listed on binance, i really dont want to make another account, but if it is as promosing as ENJ...."
1614797891,you're welcome.
1614797922,fuck you footfucker
1614797933,Why is enjin promising tho
1614797943,Is gaming really that big of a thing?
1614797962,"It has partnerships with BMW, Renault, H&M... so waiting for it hahaha"
1614798067,Perhaps the application off the coin is not sexy/hype enough for VET
1614798097,Pls ‘splain why enj is promising
1614798120,The gamemarket and nft are hyping as crazy right now
1614798135,Some nft card from mbappe was sold for 65k
1614798149,"Yeah I know nfts are the hot thing rn, but for games?"
1614798170,Gaming is billlion dolar industry
1614798171,I guess ENJ is used as an ingame currency?
1614798190,And it has been approved by the jp government
1614798196,"Gaming is a billion dollar industry, but is ENJ aiming to be the backbone of the entire industry?"
1614798220,Japanese market alone could back it up quite nicely
1614798248,If the JP giverment already accepted thw coin to be used in ingame purchases
1614798269,We live in crazy times
1614798286,Enj keeps climbing. So@and Bat 😩
1614798310,I’m not convinced w BAT
1614798329,I think ill make a short enj this night
1614798344,It will come down to earth a bit I would assume
1614798345,And tegret it next morning
1614798372,This much pump is pretty hard to sustain
1614798374,"I like how all the coins I have the smallest amount in are doing the best, and the ones I have the most in are doing the worst 😂"
1614798484,Hey profit is profit🤣
1614798656,Thats what I'm saying. I would have made more if I had more in BTC and less in ETH but Im still up 75% on ETH. Profit is for sure profit and I'm not gonna cry about ***ONLY*** making 75%
1614798663,thats almost 2x
1614798704,Gotta take the Ws when you can get them even if you could have had a bigger one else where. Anything is better than red
1614798749,True
1614798757,Grats on the chadliness @Jeremyfto
1614798776,Thanks mate! Its a good day to be a chad :chad:
1614799101,Are you guys interested in some mid term non-binance calls?
1614799158,Yeah i'd be
1614799176,Oops non binance
1614799183,Could be
1614799202,Depends on where shall it be
1614799206,Non binance being uniswap eth pair
1614799344,ENJ apparently tries that but their biggest disadvantage is they do not have their own blockchain suitable for games. They are on Ethereum and rely on Ethereum. And afaik they are closed source.
1614799375,Didn’t they announce today plans to swap networks or something?
1614799381,Admittedly haven’t looked too closely.
1614799621,xem its a good crypto right now?
1614799667,Check twitter they launch one in April
1614799756,SLP MOONING CHECK
1614801700,u said this before
1614801702,and it didnt
1614801705,but this time it may!
1614802782,"again, DYOR etc but Eth is having a rest at the moment before it continues, so anyone not on the train, nice time to buy. I dont see any multiday sign of a slow down yet."
1614802863,To buy ETH?
1614802884,thats literally what i wrote dude
1614803518,I need to talk to me like I’m 4yo. Lol just that u mentioned DYOR. So had to make sure
1614803714,haha 😄
1614803840,@Sausage Destroyer oh my godess oh you holy being 😄 did u predict enj going so high in such period ? if yes we gonna be needing a lot more detailed reports in the future 😄 most of us dumped at 85-95 range today from what i saw 🙂
1614803883,That was me lol
1614803888,lmao
1614803895,with time frames and $ gain possibilities 😄
1614803896,“Oh my goddess oh you holy being”
1614803901,"i make the most of it, the rises are in waves, so i take profit, then wait for it to retrace, buy again, rinse and repeat until it exhausts itself"

1614804155,"ok @Capet2 imma change one of my slower trades into SLP/ETH, just because I believe in you."
1614804177,Fond memories. Thanks dazzz
1614804205,Welcome to Daz space travel
1614804219,im still having some troubles with futures contracts
1614804227,dont fully understand them lmao
1614804249,around positions clearing and know how much i should pay or where to see that
1614804322,Weekly trips to the 🌙
1614804460,"Dont fuck with futures, its basically a gambling"
1614804501,"shit, I can't that low vol is scaring me off,"
1614804503,"This is incorrect. Its only gambling after a certain amount. Did you know that 2x on bitcoin when its at 50,000$ has to drop ALL the way down to 25,000$ for liquidation"
1614804521,"Rule of thumb, 20x and higher is gambling"
1614804578,"anything less is just increasing the stakes of your investment. If you believe an investment is going to go up, 10x is a pretty good place to be. The only people who believe it's gambling are the people who haven't tried it out for themselves OR did too much leverage"
1614804583,"A bit of news for anyone interested in XRP. Turns out the rumors +5 years ago were true, there is a private version of the XRPL for banks.

https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-pilots-a-private-ledger-for-central-banks-launching-cbdcs/"
1614804623,
1614804667,Those are my positions from this morning. Thanks to futures they are a lot more profitable than if I did standard trading. Notice my liquidation spots. 1318 on ETH even with 10x leverage
1614804703,"My dad sent me a link to join today but I was very wary about this. Could it be worth just joining, mining and no loss if nothing comes of it?"
1614804709,I believed in my investment so I took on leverage. I had more belief that it would go up instead of dropping to 1318
1614804739,"with the upward trend, a 25% dip from where I was buying in seemed unlikely and it paid off in my favor."
1614804810,"How about rent? And how do you cash out of futures - cancel leverage and keep profits, is there a time frame"
1614804847,Not on binance unless you go into options. Their normal futures are indefinite as long as you don't drop to your liquidation point
1614804874,"The more we go up, the less likely my position is to get all the way to my liquidation point in future dips"
1614804906,what do yall think about alpha?
1614804922,"The funding timer on the top of futures is when your position is reported to the market and ""refreshed"" in the background although it doesn't affect you much"
1614804980,"That's what I am thinking, yes it could be shit but it's at not tell expense to me"
1614805005,"But lets say you bought some futures at 100$ BTC way back when, if your position didn't ever drop to your liquidation point, you would still have the SAME position today"
1614805016,and be making profits on all the leverage there with it
1614805090,I always recommend people who are curious about futures do 2-5x to start and work their way up based on their risk tolerance. I prefer Isolated margin opposed to cross margin because I can manipulate my risk tolerance in real time a lot easier
1614805130,"If I think things are getting dicey, I can put MORE into my margin to reduce my liquidation price. If I think we are pretty far away from the liquidation price, I can remove from my margin and reinvest it"
1614805214,"and whenever you are done with your position, you can instantly close it. You can also put stop losses and take profits just like normal trading"
1614805319,"imo futures/margin are really good if you know what you are doing, the real bs are those up/down leverage binance tokens"
1614805360,I am also not a fan of binance tokens. You give away a lot of control that you have over a position for opting for binance tokens instead
1614805387,BUT they are less risky as far as 0ing out is concerned
1614805398,still I would much rather have control
1614805415,"Personally i find very very useful what @Jeremyfto said about futures! Take note if you’re new to it!! 🔥 And always put the money you’re up to lose, don’t forget that!"
1614805455,for sure
1614805477,there is also the fact that they are not good on long term
1614805644,"I personally don't know enough about their long term ability to comment on that but I think its a lot more helpful just learning the futures system instead of opting for the binance tokens. Its one of those things that once you get past the learning curve, you will be glad you learned opposed to doing binance tokens where you lack a large amount of control. Its just one of those things that is too simplistic for it to be a good enough alternative"
1614805807,"Is this the dip for #ENJ or will it drop further so I can load up a bit more, I took 50% out of it at 1.30?"
1614806169,so china pumps just so america can dump ? 😄 why chineese ppl wanna loose and feed america ? 😄 am i getting this at least 50% correct or what ? 😄
1614806197,i think u have this reversed bro... lmao
1614806250,haha ofc i may be but 😄 china wakes up price goes up... and now its going down just before china wakes up again to pump it back up again ? 😄
1614806378,"if you look at actual coin flows china is dumping on NA. They ain't buying btc, they are mining it"
1614806392,70% of global btc is mined in china rn
1614806458,this is probably because NA markets closed so trading activity moved to crypto in the AH....
1614806580,yea the chinese are mining it like crazy for sure 😄
1614806982,what coin are u talking about?
1614807034,"btc mate the king,"
1614807061,u guys think iotx its a good crypto?
1614810261,Harmony(One) dirt chip... any prospects to double on it?:)
1614811271,VTHO doing numbers
1614811390,Thats some crazy pump
1614812732,Guys

1614815127,and elon musk finaly landed his starship 😄
1614815628,"@MeNtisH sorta, then it blew up.  🤣"
1614815644,haha an amazing progress and double flight 😄
1614815775,Was fuckin cool watching that huge thing land itself though.  Wow
1614815806,needs abit more thrust time and probabliy beter landing gear
1614816199,Def a better landing gear.
1614816214,i havent even seen its gear
1614816225,even the falcon feet is
1614816229,kinda weak looking?
1614816272,"Yeah you thinkd theyd spend a bit more time on that feature.. one step at a time in rocketry, I suppose."
1614816393,tbh the raptor legs havent failed anymore
1614822317,2-2:15 we should be a go on enj again
1614822330,15-30mins
1614822502,why
1614822977,"don't tell me you sold your SLP, look at my the chart i posted and the price now 🙂"
1614823133,here
1614823363,"no i didn't enter the trade because the liquidity was a problem for me, in terms of when the time comes for me to exit that trade."
1614823421,pfffft don’t let a little low liquidity scare you away from making millions.
1614823438,"lol, or ending up a bag holder"
1614823481,@Capet2 slp 4k sats
1614823494,I prefer axs
1614823495,Enjin is about to fire up now
1614823550,How did you call it going up in 15 mins. What’s the basis for that call
1614823576,yep. 1.50 or bust niw
1614823578,now*
1614823596,I’m so confused. Is it just an artificial pump?
1614823604,How else would you just know in 15 mins it’s going up
1614823788,No natural growth at 2am every night
1614823814,Huh. Is that when a certain market wakes up/starts trading?
1614823856,"Look hard enough and you can find the patterns, morning break time now in Japan. When lunchtime hits we really go bang"
1614823873,"Ahh, okay that makes sense. Thanks for the insight."
1614824133,Choo choooo climb aboard the space train
1614824463,should i buy enj at 1.13 rn?
1614824604,"Idk anything about the coin but looking at the charts id say its too high, and volumes arent huge either"
1614824725,"me either, i just know that enj have done something with minecraft"
1614824791,Oh i didnt know that lemme check
1614824882,"idk, i was thinking since there will be a huge minecraft update soon the coin could pump even more"
1614824903,"Doesnt sound that huge, basically they created a mod that allows you to purchase stuff from certain servers right?"
1614824931,"And yeah, everyone wants to become a ""gaming crypto"" now ig lol"
1614824949,yeah
1614824970,"I think its going down short term anyways, if you plan on buying id wait a little"
1614824986,Around 1$ sounds nice
1614824991,probably
1614824996,but who knows
1614825074,Well if you think it has the potential to grow huge go for it haha
1614825088,imo some analyzes don't even make that much sense since there is elon musk on twitter
1614825106,jk
1614825116,btw alpha is booming
1614825150,"Well yeah its crypto lol, its much more random than stock market"
1614825178,Enjin has left the station
1614825192,Im not on alpha but damn it doubled in one week
1614825236,by that you mean?
1614825275,Left for the moon
1614825411,7% in 5 mins
1614825496,Anything below $2 is a bargain they're using this coin for the new Atari consoles native currency
1614825556,where we do we think she will perch this time dazz
1614825622,Yeah never listen to my calls lmao
1614825670,take a look at the call i made on enj like 2 days ago? post grad podium
1614825694,@Sausage Destroyer how are you feeling about ETH going to ATH? Changed your mind?
1614825717,"nerp, still gonna do it, today will likely show a chunk up to confirm that its on its way up"
1614825786,You guys are like fucking soothsayers to the medieval peasant that I am. I just felt like a punt on longing ETH
1614825824,And this is where we are now lmao
1614825832,"i dont think i have been wrong yet on my public calls - thats not to say im never wrong, even the best traders in the world dont crack 70% win rate."
1614825837,you owe me a beer mate!
1614825846,Probably more than one
1614825906,"the trick is to keep the losses on the 30% wrong small, with tight stops - and your wins on the 70% success nice and high in the clouds"
1614825908,"Like no offence but I’m not gonna follow every post-grad call blindly, especially with coins I’ve never heard of, but I was hoping ETH was gonna climb and your post was just the nudge I needed to do something ridiculous"
1614825934,"nah and i dont expect you to, as always people should DD everything"
1614825937,I mean sensible.
1614825940,No ridiculous
1614825946,😅
1614825961,"im in doubt between buying leverage enjin or longing eth, what would you do?"
1614826000,both seems promising
1614826043,"enji will run out of steam at some point, like, the train started 2 days ago, idk when slow down signs will start but it should be any day now."
1614826159,btw is there any difference between margin leverage or future leverage?
1614826170,I disagree and think we see £20 this week £1-200 before the end of march
1614826259,"idk about that, all i know is what i see before me as far as extrapolation of data is concerned, you lose accuracy the further out you get. i prefer to analyse and adjust daily. and when i say run out of steam, i mean in terms of the very volatile gains"
1614826262,"How much money is spent on gta bucks every day, think of this as the japanese version of those for mobiles atm.
The gaming industry is a multi billion dollar market"
1614826288,You're thinking this will 20x?
1614826317,I think in a year this will be worth 1k plus
1614826321,Lmao
1614826334,How do you come to this
1614826375,"20$ may happen, but i doubt the 200 soon"
1614826410,Lol you really want to ask?
1614826432,I've been pumping ERDSL
1614826483,"Check the twitter and all today's announcements, right now this is the only crypto authorized for use already in Japan. It's the mobile game currency for almost every mobile game that uses a payment network that these and Atari run. It was listed on the Japanese stock exchange this morning"
1614826546,I pretty much ask anything here haha
1614826556,Dont know if it was a joke or not
1614826571,enjin twitter?
1614826590,My portfolio speaks for itself after only 3 weeks trading. It's all about the long term goals and capabilities of who you back
1614826601,Yes @ enjin
1614826604,That looks like it got listed in January?
1614826614,lol
1614826619,cant there be links on this chat?
1614826623,I can't post links?
1614826624,Lol
1614826645,The announcement came in January and this week the mobile payments network got switched on
1614826646,Rank i guess
1614826696,Yeah the link was coindesk citing that they are the first to be legal in Japan
1614826740,also interesting that Microsoft Azure marketing director left Microsoft after 20 years to join enjin
1614826755,it's in the first article I was blocked from posting
1614826867,i guess 10$ is easy task for enjin
1614826918,"I do full research before investing any of my money. I also back winning stables, not winning horses"
1614827030,i have to agree that enjin surpassed any prediction by a lot
1614827071,I made 3 analysis charts today as within 40minutes each one got demolished
1614827072,You guys think ENJ can hit $2 before being dumped again?
1614827077,I just still can’t get on board with a gaming token
1614827086,I’m pumped y’all are making some big gains though.
1614827143,"In 1 hour the big jump will start, lunch time Japan, what do people do on the work break? Play mobile games"
1614827174,School kids buying outfits for characters etc
1614827182,I agree @BuffWanderer. I'm hodling Mana in the interim and hoping it'll see adoption on coinbase
1614827208,"Tbh MANA is a far worse bet than ENJ, in my opinion."
1614827228,Decentraland is just kind of a worse Minecraft
1614827268,Lol I got in early so just hodl
1614827269,It
1614827275,'s not really a gaming play at all
1614827279,Sandbox is better
1614827282,Yeah I feel that.
1614827305,It's not a fun game but it's more of a second life
1614827312,the casino is getting interesting though imo
1614827335,Have you heard of Hodlgod?
1614827340,I have not
1614829547,"Ooh I just found out enjin have over 21 mobile and online games that connect to enjin crypto wallet, they sell rare in game items using enjin coin. Enjin coins are transferable throughout every game in in the enjin multiverse.
I also found a link ppl can pay a deed on a property from as little as $100 using the app and enjin tokens.
This was announced  on the 2nd through a  partnership with Labs group."
1614830108,"if you like enj and are looking for a similar project, AXS may interest you (up 34% past 24 hrs as well)"
1614831080,@Romeeeo Why is it up exactly?
1614831397,related to hype around NFTs @jason617
1614834631,the nfl needs to release nftsssss
1614834673,the nba nfts made over 200 million already
1614838858,Oh shit are they gonna go up in value heaps?
1614840857,"Jeez, ENJ growth making me FOMO"
1614841152,"Yesterday fomo was building up in me while I was looking at ENJ going up, but I did not buy bc in most of the cases the price dumps down immediately after I buy. It would not have happened yesterday, but it's okay cause I know I haven't lost anything"
1614841315,"Someone gave the great tip for it a few days back but i didn’t have the funds at the time to throw in. Ahh well, will just cop it and watch with interest I think"
1614844848,It was @bcdcdaz who started talking about it back when it was still $0.50 or so
1614844894,"I jumped in at $0.56, not exactly with my life savings"
1614845864,yea great call from dazzz and Domme
1614845870,could have played it better :p
1614845922,@HODLer You need to make Dazz a post grad.
1614845960,Nice
1614845967,Enjin coin
1614845996,I jumped in at .78. With everything i got.
1614846019,Yea by that time I was in pretty heavily too
1614846028,Easy $1K overnight
1614846045,"Well, not easy, bcause i was shitting bricks all night"
1614846100,@HODLer Saw you typing. I am not joking. You have no idea what this group is missing out without Dazz at helm
1614846134,After 3 weeks of trading?
1614846137,you do have to be carefull with people making calls :p
1614846162,He has some mad potential. We already have amazing mid-long term traders at the helm. Dazz is great at short term
1614846181,"One call on one coin is cool, but many more miles of track record required for post grad"
1614846191,He still can give calls or am I wrong? 😅
1614846224,He's been bang on with atleast 3 that i can count. This is 3 out of 4. The wrong one being ADA which im sure everyone was fooled by
1614846269,Heh he did have doubts about ada after the initial surges
1614846276,Yep
1614846279,It's still open long term of course
1614846281,But it was ADA
1614846302,"This chat is open, he can give here calls based on his analysis at anytime here. Or do you need ""post grad"" to give calls here? Of course each one has to take his risks, make his own analysis and then decide if invest or not."
1614846306,"Exactly, but i would not listen to Dazz about it for that. Would listen to Swiss or San. 

Short term, dazz is brilliant"
1614846318,A £20 ENJ was called for end of week so we'll see about that
1614846359,"Ok. @HODLer Lets make a deal. If ENJ is  more than 3 euros by the end of this week, then Dazz becomes a post grad"
1614846389,"Yea he definitely seems to be able to connect tons of dots with upcoming coins, but sure let's wait for an album before calling him a one hit wonder"
1614846397,"Ehm, no. £20 was the call?"
1614846413,no way lol
1614846462,no way I can HODL all the way to 20 pound 😦
1614846526,Back off. He is my best mate now lol
1614846578,Yea he is good in researching I would say
1614846588,dont know what his age / background is :p
1614846678,Loads of enthusiasm for sure. And goals.
1614846681,"MIght be 20 euros, but lets be realistic. 

Its important to invest in the right people, not just the right coin. 😳 (thats deep man)"
1614846701,but e.g. he wasnt part of the bear market etc
1614846717,so I think a post grad has to have some bagage also
1614846883,"I've given my two cents. And as far as im concerned, im HODLing."
1614847076,I hope you hodl more than you did with ADA 😁
1614847101,Im still in ADA
1614847117,Getting rid of ADA to go on ENJ was a good call ☝️
1614847128,Again after you took a 5-8% loss the first time😀
1614847132,I also dropped ADA 😦
1614847139,No one called me about it. Lol
1614847140,I will re enter when I see a movement upwards
1614847159,See again we're all shifting perpective to Dazz's
1614847176,there is so much movement on ENJ :p
1614847210,Dazz is moving it. Dazzling isn’t it. 😁💵
1614847232,@bcdcdaz How does it feel to be famous?
1614847238,Does it change you?
1614847275,I kept some ADA for diversity but making a bit of loss in order to make big gains beats just having diamond hands
1614847281,"Just by curiosity, how many of you have invested or wants to invest in long term projects? Like XSL-Labs, Casper (when opens), CSHB? Or you are more day-a-day trading?"
1614847290,Good morning my enjin workers 🤣🤣
1614847294,flexible hands lol
1614847329,Trying to be 50%/50% for a while
1614847341,"This is crazy and explains all the growth, ppl can buy real estate with enjin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
1614847438,I got bit of CHSB 🙂 hoping for best :))
1614847479,80% long term 20% short
1614847504,doenst that also depends on your budget?
1614847520,I can imagine if you have like 100k that you are more longterm
1614847540,but if you have like 500 euro that you are more yolo
1614847544,I don´t have 100K and I go long term 😀 only a bit day-trading
1614847590,I truly believe that the best way to make money is to invest in projects with good fundamentals and holding it for a longer time.
1614847620,I daytrade for fun or to fill up the longterm bags
1614847659,That´s the strategy I´m trying to follow too (when my day-trades are successful hhaha)
1614847691,This doesn’t mean daytrading is bad or you shouldn’t do it btw. But short term in a bull market is way easier than in a bear market
1614847718,"My feiend who knows some tricks of market investment, said u get more in long term if u patients instead of scalping where and there 5-10% u lose on commissions plus wrong calls selling too early or too late."
1614847746,"so that means that you know that you can go -60/70% middle long term, but you are prepared for that then mentally Jelle?"
1614847756,But even with TA i look at fundamentals. So that when it doesn’t work out like the analysis said i can still hold and make money
1614847762,that like my main issue I have
1614847768,surviving that bear market :p
1614847840,What I like about coins.  Even if price down still change u get ur money back and it will double.  As u still hold coins.  A like forex trade u lost u screwed lol from@one candle down u done balance wiped out
1614847853,If you do not trust it you can always swap for fiat. This includes the risk of missing out on a new bull market
1614847854,"Buy and bake , bake pump is on!!"
1614847865,"there´s where I´m trying to learn more, so see much more behind the coin when I daily-trade, in case something goes wrong, I keep it and at some point I can get out with benefit"
1614847897,We are still early adopters in the crypto scene
1614847912,This market has a lot more potential to grow
1614847949,can you imagine microsoft partnering up with a coin
1614847962,not sure if they will create their own tho
1614848017,Did you see the article @Sjoerd de Jong sent the other day?
1614848020,it blows my mind but yeah maybe 1 in 50 ppl I ask have any clue how crypto works or how to get some other than cash app btc
1614848033,somehow still really early
1614848035,No I did not
1614848039,I did visit his site :p
1614848040,"https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/
I see 68 M 🙂"
1614848118,Like i said there is still a lot more room to grow in the crypto world
1614848206,The crypto market has a lot of potential. Whether companies like Microsoft will adapt is something i can’t say. They could for sure.
1614848228,"yea, I'm an ERP consultant"
1614848232,There is a reason why companies like tesla buy so much bitcoin
1614848244,so I can imagine using VET in that context
1614848250,Sure
1614848260,or even in a ledger context
1614848279,and I see that we are just barely touching it right now
1614848297,our blockchain unit is like 1 person right now I think :p
1614848347,and next week we have a company session
1614848348,-    Blockchain and cryptocurrency: everything you need to know (Thomas) – 30min
1614848358,so its also on the mind of people
1614848393,Well i do believe that specializing in companies use for crypto can give you a bright future
1614848399,"and I work for a big four company, so we are conservative like crazy :p"
1614848460,These kind of things is the beginning of adoption. The company is further developed than other companies
1614848483,The companies who want nothing to do with crypto
1614848507,i think we did some POCS for some financial instutions already
1614848515,so they will move there eventually
1614848568,I've had a bot running for a week on UNFI-BTC pair at these settings:
1614848575,"but you know they are very reluctant to change, so could take a while :d"
1614848575,And these are the results
1614848616,"(Actually I might have tweaked the step of extra order a bit higher along the way, but mostly like that)"
1614848620,Such revolutionary changes take time
1614848672,So I had a maximum of about $50 on UNFI at any one point
1614848685,WTF!
1614848734,Made a few trades huh 😅
1614848792,Somehow i feel we only have another 6 months till crypto is the crypto we know. Corporate involvement will insight regulations that will make it very similar to the stock market. Begin the emergence of Virtual Street
1614848826,SO specialising in todays crypto might not be the same as what one would do at that time
1614848886,"Anyway – UNFI is about where it was a week ago when the bot started, 72k sats. It had a good beginning but then went down, but the bot kept taking profits"
1614848919,You are using TradeSantaClause arent you?
1614848955,"Yea that one. I like it because it makes tons and tons of trades, all the others think for a day and make one trade, then wait for days to take profit"
1614849022,For UNFI those settings were quite good and in general it's been a great coin for the bot
1614849230,So I could have locked $500 and taken $300 profit in 1 week with UNFI without doing much else but getting the bot going. Nice thing is not many of the bots I setup made loss even during the dip
1614849591,I tried TradeSanta but found the app horrible and laggy
1614849669,Yea it's laggy
1614849742,The trading functionality seems solid however
1614849992,"Anyway thought I'd share that, I think bots can be a nice way of making a bit of passive extra profit on the coins that you're betting on or may not be quite sure about"
1614850097,BTC goes bit down so and most with it.
1614850111,Things going red lol
1614850119,Need more green. 💵💵💵
1614852720,There is a war going on at 49k
1614852728,Lets see what happens
1614853256,ETH is hanging in there
1614853279,"You can do it ETH, ignore your bigger brother"
1614853289,Come on eth. Crash
1614853297,Wow uncalled for
1614853310,Why this ETH hate :p
1614853343,cause we need to buy chip and sale it when its 2k again
1614853364,I am not in stablecoins
1614853370,Cant reload :p
1614853480,Yes crash to 800 bucks so i can fill up 0.8 and have one eth
1614853517,i did nice profit shorting ICX
1614853681,"You can fill up on LTC now, only 184$"
1614853731,Only?   What was the highest ?
1614853756,2 weeks ago it was at 240
1614853779,And yesterday up to 196
1614853809,Not bad. Small profit in short time possible
1614853892,I have all to hold. But the other day I got some ETS when it went down and sold it after it got up. Same day in the evening.  10% profit 🙂
1614854312,$SXP looking good to climb
1614854586,"I have something to confess

In my bag I have … I have doge"
1614854726,:kekw:
1614855886,I just sent a link to @SeineJanie turns out enj have links to Microsoft too
1614855901,"finally got a bot, excited to make profits the next bps and mega pumps hehe"
1614855907,gonna aim for 50% profit most likely
1614856191,the wat
1614856201,enj good crypto?
1614856298,Yeah they have loads of games on the android app store and some of them are pretty cool
1614856763,don´t come here to cry after you´ll be -50% 😀
1614856849,Surprised to see ada dip and struggle so much
1614856865,Maybe time to buy more 😁
1614856950,Considering it still is not even 70% of its ATH (approx 1.05 US) I’d say it’s not too bad
1614856966,I’d have been worried if it dipped below a dollar in this time
1614857061,im positive it should be quite easy 😉
1614857065,ada hasnt retraced to 1.05 or 1
1614857069,which i was expecting it to
1614857075,so there must be some buying pressure
1614857076,fibonacci retracement?
1614857088,yeah
1614857097,hmm i still needa learn how to do that
1614857330,yoo ada dipping rn
1614857336,"might get to 1,05 this time?"
1614857356,its hard for it to fall below 1.15 but it just did it
1614857365,"you´re not even in the bps or megapump group, if you´re trying to sell a bot here you´re in the wrong place mate 🙂"
1614857403,Luckily had a short strategy bot running on ADA
1614857434,"i am, ill share some results once the pumps are over mate 🙂"
1614857462,"anyone asked for it, but good luck :))"
1614857492,and you just joined BPS btw 😉
1614857537,So keep an eye on him Admins :))
1614857757,yeah look at this
1614857766,ada has some serious problems falling below 1.15
1614857789,now it got lower than days ago but i think because of less volume
1614857808,"What ever happens now, I’m holding as I’m staking."
1614857838,It will go up. BtC will go up and the rest with it. How ever ENJ my god says duck to BTC and has its own way 🍿
1614857931,I’m worried about f2pool’s dumping tho
1614857956,"A small one happened again earlier today, they seem to be targeting anything above 50k"
1614857966,yeah im staking too
1614857969,Like how long do they plan on doing this ugh
1614857974,"in fact, as long as it keeps above 1.2 $"
1614857981,I'm going to try and find enj staking
1614857983,i wont lose any money that i ever put into crypto
1614857996,i have my entry amount and a lil more
1614858015,so this is my savings coin
1614858026,the rest is atm at nano and eth futures
1614858075,Ada ?
1614858174,yeah
1614858218,"i entered crypto with 100€, put a lil more than that to staking"
1614858660,Anyone ready for the next enjin news
1614858767,"A link in Dec on enjin twitter says you can stake on bancor (whatever that is) never heard of the exchange, you can stake bnt for enj"
1614859073,I’ve mentioned before few times. iOTa it’s very stable. No movement 🤔.
1614859177,Enj 😫 why i only got 50 💆🏻‍♂️
1614859332,I joined Ada with that dip 🙂
1614859385,I need a bigger enjin bag
1614859538,@Sausage Destroyer told you so
1614859607,Im in to hols. Got some under 1$ and other half over 1$. So all in all ever age price .90-1usd.  Will be staking holding and waiting 🙂
1614859716,"I have a feeling, BTC will dip once more, maybe to 48k, before taking off again. Could be wrong though. Not crystal clear today."
1614859808,All but ENj looks wobbly today 💆🏻‍♂️ trying not to see red.  Too much red in my accounts today.
1614859924,Enj 1£. Fucks given to reds market
1614859926,i was thinking the same
1614859928,CHSB also green
1614859932,Excuse my French
1614859944,Je m'excuse ton Francais
1614859957,I am hoping it will go up like Enj 🙂
1614859990,"oh, it will moon eventually for sure"
1614860004,"If not, they'll just burn more tokens 😄"
1614860044,Sounds very secure re assuring!
1614860079,"no, seriously... this process has hand and foot. No manipulation"
1614860101,Go go go enjin on fire again
1614860107,It’s in their interest to keep token up stable and growing.
1614860213,$3-$4 enjin by this time tomorrow in my opinion
1614860255,Let’s hope so. Then I can sale it and then buy again on deep and leave it for few years when there is less of it left and each cost 100-1000 :)))
1614860278,"So on that note – what is everyone looking at mostly – the $ or the btc balance? I'm focusing on growing the btc mostly since I'm not looking to cash out any time soon, trying to distance myself from btc's daily value (apart from the fact that alts typically crash harder, they're like they're connected to btc with a rubber rope)"
1614860290,But doing that will lose you so much interest @TheOne
1614860327,What u mean ?
1614860384,I also look at BTC value Jay
1614860395,even if my cash goes down but my BTC value goes up
1614860395,I bought in at £0.40 by holding I will double my long hold 100% every 40pence increase
1614860405,I consider that a win :p
1614860419,I mean btc value I look at when I daydream about lambos
1614860458,it has taken me 1 month of trading to be ahead of the curve
1614860478,before that I was minus compared to just holding BTC :p
1614860530,ENJ is horrible. The FOMO is slowly creeping onto me.
1614860544,Yea that seems to happen to me if I don't have time to manually trade or can't tend to the bots
1614860556,buds
1614860567,what is the minimum amount to buy a long position for futures perpetual?
1614860569,"Both actually. If my BTC value goes up while my $ value goes down, great! But I like both to go up or at least one of them to stay steady 😉
Not sacrificing dollar gain for BTC loss, though"
1614860603,Stepping in now seems madness
1614860611,I know but...
1614860612,I will buy again in a dip tho :p
1614860616,what does fomo stands for?
1614860621,Fear of missing out
1614860626,Imagine it never dips again
1614860629,Only pumps
1614860632,To the moon
1614860633,Mars
1614860636,Jupiter
1614860640,I think the marketcap is quite big?
1614860643,saturn like btc
1614860646,should look more into detail
1614860653,but I dont think it can explode that much
1614860666,the enj 4hr looks like it might peak 1.6 before it takes a tumble pretty over bought
1614860673,The market cap is 30-40% up in 2 days
1614860679,How to buy it ?
1614860697,Swissborg app
1614860775,I got my ENj 50p and now doubled it alrady
1614860795,If I sale or now. I’m 100% profit on it
1614860816,£1.06 enjin now
1614860825,"bnb went from 40 to 340 easily, i think enjin could do the same"
1614860850,not saying it will go crash hard
1614860861,But then buy back on the dip and you need double the value for the next 100%
1614860864,but it needs to come down a good bit its over bought to fuck
1614860882,like yeah it could send but if it dont you in a such a sshit spot
1614860898,im really new i already know when something too risky
1614860915,A shit spot that will be fixed within a day and be making gains
1614860929,I am happy to share referral 🙂 to get free BtC 🙂
1614860981,I’ve registered yesterday. Was easy and money from bank arrived in 2 seconds. A like Binace and no fee.  No first reposit some then wait approval etc
1614861012,fixed within a day or wait a day and get in lower? again im new i know fuck all but some things are clearly obvious
1614861051,Is there anything special for staking ?
1614861069,Im not too familiar with that it’s like a contract to hold ?
1614861099,Yes. And u get fre Adas
1614861123,Like deposit to bank with %. But u can pull out anytime. No 30 days lock or more or a week.
1614861196,I can do that on binance ?
1614861246,Dedalouse (excuse my spelling) is better.
1614861257,U can transfer from binance for 1ada.
1614861273,SLP/ETH MOON hehe
1614861280,U stake it 5% a year.
1614861296,So free 5% plus what ever price go up.  🙂
1614861310,or down
1614861338,Yea but free adas. Will cover some of that down
1614861350,At least in my view 🙂
1614861353,Do not stake on binance. Yoroi for phone or Daedalus for computer
1614861401,Daedalus wallet does not exist on android or iphone
1614861405,scam alert
1614861416,check their official site daedaluswallet.io i think
1614861463,ADA is just kind of floating and wondering where to head to next
1614861531,what does ADL mean in futures?
1614861538,i think i dont get it through binance explanation

1614862525,doubt it will drop that much

1614862588,yea that sounds good

1614862775,does anyone know how do i find a external adress to withdraw this BtC money from tlscape?
1614862835,Depends on where you want to transfer it to. You will find the adress of your Binance wallet here: https://www.binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/deposit/crypto/BTC
1614862937,Forgot to mention crypto. Com started margin trading yesterday
1614863285,Sad bought my Ada too high 😦
1614863375,So i can buy something using this wallet ?
1614863402,"Yes, most if not all coins on Binance have a BTC-pair"
1614863525,"okay, but can I log in to this page through my Tlscape account or create a new one?"
1614863530,U not the only one. But patience will be rewarded. 🙂
1614863622,"I don't know what Tlscape is. If you want to use Binance for trading, you need to get a Binance account."
1614863650,I'd suggest you to start reading #🔤crypto-101
1614863721,I just want to withdraw this money to my bank account but I don't know what the external address is and where to get it
1614863724,ok
1614863910,sup
1614864084,"Buckle up shits about to get fast, enj is all over twitter now"
1614864115,Not too mention almost every exchange in the world's top gainers
1614864164,wait till actual whales know its real value
1614864171,and make it move
1614864173,"I still haven't got an answer to my question, only if I would like to withdraw my money to my bank account and where should I find my external address on this bank account"
1614864175,either up or down
1614864184,but i'd say down for a lil
1614864191,The fomo hits hard x
1614864263,"I don't know about Tlscape, but when you have your BTC for instance on Binance, you can sell them and transfer fiat money to your bank account."
1614864298,okay i'll try to transfer my BTC from Tlscape to Binance
1614864441,Chz well over 100%
1614864477,I sew it going up
1614864483,Could be good for a bot
1614864710,ENJ is gonna drop
1614864717,I put in a buy order
1614864720,Be ready :p
1614864903,any prediction?
1614864947,Yea when I buy in
1614864955,Coins tend to drop :’)
1614864991,"I got an open order with tp at 1,445, so it'll never even reach that again"

1614865005,same with me
1614865009,I keep buying into the green candle
1614865013,And it keeps going up
1614865018,Its a crazy run
1614865027,change candle colours
1614865030,switch them
1614865035,now you'll made diamond hands
1614865036,trust me
1614865041,Yea I mean
1614865045,I buy into the dips
1614865056,But the dips are higher then where I exited in the first place
1614865100,Anyone know how to transfer BTC from tlscape to binance ?
1614865159,I'm learning the ropes of future trading right now. I got an order liquidated because the rate dropped too low **immediately** before going above my tp for that order 💀
1614865165,can someone help me understanding this thing
1614865294,"I put 50$ in the futures account to play around with, made 20$ within minutes and lost 50$ within an hour"
1614865311,One could say it went just like expected 😆
1614865320,exactly like me
1614865348,this was frustrating though
1614865406,nvm already read about it
1614865509,"its just it bugged me that a 20x order with an hour of age, is higher at the queue of ADL than a 12h old one 10x"
1614865515,its because of the 20x
1614865544,and high volatility
1614865685,Maybe anyone know how to withdraw money from tlscape ?
1614865710,"No, you'll just have to keep it there. How did it get in there in the first place?"
1614865779,Someone from this server send me code and i got umm about 0.385 BTC what is $20k
1614865790,And he said i win a giveaway
1614865800,Yeah it’s false
1614865804,oh
1614865813,thats sad
1614865909,But it shows that I have money on this website and can be withdrawn
1614865915,So idk
1614866019,Yeah it’s a scam
1614866064,Its scam
1614866082,I have 10messenges of scam xD
1614866084,Oh
1614866092,Next step would be: we need 0.01btc to be able to transfer your giveaway to you
1614866093,they probably want you to link you account in the hopes its the one you store money on so they can take it
1614866107,that too
1614866114,Yep
1614866144,No one give free money 😅
1614866151,likely want the private keys for you to do the 'transfer' compromising your funds
1614866168,"I say we peak at 19-20 with enj before a slow dip, sorry it should have said 1.9-2.0"
1614866181,so the amount shown there is not really there or is it impossible to withdraw from this site?
1614866197,its fake balance
1614866202,100%
1614866212,aint no one giving you 20k pal sorry
1614866246,Chz making me a happy man
1614866248,Swiss token one I got some free BtC from referral. If someone want one. And I could spend it same day no pressure to add doble or something I’ve changed it to CBSH tokens with no stings attached
1614866274,I'm sad that I'm stupid enough to fall for it
1614866288,Let’s hope. Then I sale and then I buy more :))
1614866335,You didn't
1614866358,just use your experience to warn others who ask all the same questions you did and help them not make the same mistake
1614866384,if you lost no money but tried link an empty account just make a new one to be safe or change passwords ect.
1614866430,i don't lost my money
1614866443,Actually I’ll convert it to BTC 🙂
1614866444,then you ALMOST fell for it 😉
1614866461,i just paste code and get 20k dollars and i want to withdraw this but its scam so i can't
1614866464,and im sad now
1614866481,"This indicator shows your position in the auto-deleverage queue. If all lights are lit, in the event of a liquidation, your position may be reduced."

1614866885,Second day I joined here. I won 0.5 BTC too.
1614866898,We all blessed here with 0.5 BtC give a ways /)
1614867004,If it would be say 0.005BTc id probably fall for it. 0.5... nah.. too good to be true lol a part from NOT ENTERING ANY DRAW.  So if i#u didn’t enter any give a ways or draws. U CANT WIN.  It’s simple.

1614872742,What do you guys think about BNB? Temporary high or good long-term investment?
1614873178,"@HODLer I also called other coins to xelo, days and weeks ago uni, matic, hbar"
1614873319,Binance hacked for 31millon
1614873369,The smart chain defi project
1614873525,the first requirement to become one is to be Senior lmao
1614873882,"It's not that hard either, I made Post Grad 2 weeks after joining the server. Quickly became senior before as well, on invites alone."
1614874085,"Okay then I get to work, I'm just doing strong backed up research before any moves and also watching everything. I'm going to the moon and feel it's only fair to offer everyone the same chance"
1614874122,I just bought another 9 enj at $1.38
1614874182,I could've just kept all these to myself but chose to share 🙂
1614874478,Me too +10 🙂
1614874527,I have 60 now. When I sale then 10£ each. I’ll send u cake lol or 1 Enj 🤣
1614874661,"Appreciated bro, someone just sent me 40 doge too lol"
1614874750,Damn
1614874757,Ive wanted to buy enj for a while now
1614874763,Just dont got the bread for it
1614874768,Shame 😪
1614874951,@bcdcdaz where do you think ENJ will be by the end of the week?
1614875163,"If continues at this pace big, give me 10-15 to do some charts and I will let you know"
1614875978,Xrp pumped no?
1614876490,"Between $3.8-$5.5 that's based on the current 20% actual growth per day, after all the dips that's been pretty consistent over the last week or so, that doesn't account for peaks and further interest.
For instance if we get some 100% days it could do $30-$50 by mid next week. In my opinion I'm not a financial advisor"
1614876911,I thought we were all anti establishment man
1614876994,3-5 would be good gain 🤠
1614877084,Its hard to say though. Everyone expected ADA to rise to 2€ or 3€ within this month aswell yet we see it stalling and retracting to 1.15
1614877226,Buy into the hype
1614877238,And then there is nobody left to buy :p
1614877251,If that Dubai fund comes through
1614877625,"I love your optimism, I’m not selling 😂"
1614877800,"If a whale catches on and buys then we're good, I'm trying to find out when this property deal goes through, as when people start buying hundreds on the app to secure property 🤑😘😘"
1614877870,i just want ETH and ADA to get back to ATH
1614877880,which isn't lil thing
1614877884,but 🙂
1614878132,"Everyone will go to these in the end,as by the time crypto is acceptable everywhere. They will already have months if not years of experience with a fully integrated system in place. that works safely and securely and creates great revenue"
1614879039,@felguerr stop making me sad
1614879051,CHSB make nobody sad.
1614879061,CHSB only make ppl happy.
1614879348,Im on the CHSB train 🙂
1614879471,Hop on guys 🙂
1614879495,There is free BtC if u register with referral.
1614879500,I got some 🙂
1614879505,How many ENJ is everyone holding?  I want to keep getting more but also want to be careful that my wallet isn’t too deep to one coin
1614879529,Im at 60. Though I’d prefer 100+
1614879540,3.8k of ENJ
1614879545,Wow!
1614879563,I got a stop loss now tho 😂
1614879610,I’ve only got 260 but would like to get 1000+ might put in a recurring buy for £100 per month at payday but fear is it’ll get too high by then
1614879627,I dont know medium term
1614879638,I think its a hype coin
1614879641,I hope not
1614879651,it could be done the next days
1614879689,It might be; all good stuff @bcdcdaz is saying and researching but if none of these end up materialising it will drop like a lead balloon
1614879698,like mentioned before
1614879705,ADA was also a sure thing
1614879710,but the market does what it does :p
1614879715,I’ve got enough ENJ to buy a bitching skin for my custom character in the My Little Pony mobile game.
1614879719,Hood rich
1614879727,🤣🤣🤣🤣
1614879743,I think ADA could be a good long term hold for 3+ years
1614879752,but I was also watching bnb thinking it couldnt go any higher
1614879759,and it went higher and higher :p
1614879805,"I intend to long term my ADA, but the 70 ENJ I have is just for hype"
1614879848,If ENJ actually hits $2 this week y’all might talk me into getting a bag
1614879849,As soon the wider general public adopt crypto coins like ADA are going to be attractive to all the environmentalist types
1614879870,Imo ADA is a hedged bet for ETH hodlers
1614879877,Im 1k plus will hold staking 🙂
1614880102,ADA is probably the better coin then for a recurring buy and we sit on ENJ waiting for the day it suddenly blasts off; which judging by what @bcdcdaz has found will happen.  He’s right the gaming industry is bigger than the films and music industries put together and has been for 15 years now
1614880168,"but games are for children and not adults, enj will never take off"
1614880180,"—my dad, 2021"
1614880202,😆 the average age of console gamers is something stupid like 30 something
1614880236,The property market is much much bigger and they're in that game now
1614880404,Yes it is but it’s just not technically savvy like gaming is; customers of gaming are far more likely to adopt something like this than property investors - don’t get me wrong there will be some adopters in property which will still be massive; but the bulk of that industry are boomers who can barely work their phones - especially at the exec level where the decisions are taken
1614880432,They already have a massive contract
1614880459,Lab group
1614880514,Cool I’ll look them up.  The property companies I deal with at work are pretty backwards thinking ; mainly the major players in London
1614880553,"Microsoft, Atari, lab group, Samsung are just a few that they work with already"
1614880554,BTC going in red
1614880562,be brave altcoins
1614880597,6 should be pump up the engine
1614880769,Any sub 1¢ that people have a good feeling about? I've missed so many
1614880827,Can i still buy CHZ now? Im late for buying it
1614881076,Yes. Please
1614881334,ok so the expectation is that around this point is the limit for btc
1614881419,ENJ and ETH survived the dip well
1614881434,enj is holding like a mother fucker
1614881460,i got in at 1.29 ... hope i dont regret it
1614881492,U know whats holding....
1614881495,Vet and xlm
1614881498,That’s what’s holding
1614881611,@Sausage Destroyer can you send you all my findings on enjin
1614881632,Enjin is on steroids
1614881781,ok boys time to collect the honey... i hope 😄
1614882206,ADA worth?
1614882225,"I *hope* 48,088 USDT was the local bottom for BTC. I put money on it, but I'm also crossing my fingers rn like you are."
1614882275,is getting close to the correction zone i was expecting
1614882280,Same! My profits are so sad compared to yesterday
1614882288,so i'd say it *might* be a good idea to get a lil bag at least
1614882291,IMO
1614882358,I might throw more into the ring tomorrow when I get my paycheck. I got an email today saying I am getting some extra moneys from the cherokees for covid relief
1614882381,I'm +/0 just now. Was slightly up before but got out of shorting too early to keep the profit
1614882398,Noice
1614882422,SwissBorg hodlers partying rn
1614882438,Im still up 95$ today because of ETH but I was up 500$ yesterday
1614882446,so im down 400$ profit
1614882452,Im@so happy I got my 100 coin to start with :).  I got it for 0.60
1614882462,"my btc is red, my eth is green 130"
1614882469,Great!
1614882476,-700 here
1614882481,Things can go fast
1614882499,Lucky they go fast both ways :p
1614882508,They really can! I was green on both my holdings and then I had a work meeting and I came back and my green was halfed on one and red on the other
1614882509,Plan to get 1k 🙂 and more and let it grow 🙂 hopeful it will@grow like Bnb 🙂 then Im good 😌
1614882549,When btc drops its like entire panic mode :’)
1614882594,"Better not to look on reds. If u don’t see it, it doesn’t exist and u don’t panic sale losing money. Tomorrow it can go all up and above 🙂"
1614882608,Breathing guys. Just keep breathing 💆🏻‍♂️
1614882634,Red is a good moment to move into bigger red candles
1614882641,Hoping for a bounce :p
1614882830,Lol rip
1614882842,I bought Ada this morning and everything down 🙂
1614882854,Risk of gambling 😂
1614883342,Stop buying in the mornings lol
1614883370,Thanks for the deep!! :))
1614883706,seems we are not done yet
1614883865,Binance just did an ama with enj
1614883924,i was waiting for enj to dip
1614883943,so not sure if it will still dip a bit more or should i think on getting in already
1614884139,Damn this dip. Well i guess i have to look optimistic to it
1614884151,Good time to buy more ade and enj
1614884207,Anyone remember who said CHZ would go up? Good call +70% i didnt buy it though
1614884299,Ama?
1614884305,Ask me anything
1614884310,ADA
1614884404,Binance France btw
1614884413,Im scared to check my accounts lol Red burning my eyes and my heart sinks. Need a Green Day.
1614884439,"ADA at 1.09 closing in on 1
Time for it to boom back no?"
1614884458,Tomorrow is better day. Greener day. If not tomorrow then other day. We just need to breath 💆🏻‍♂️
1614884473,Tomorrow is better day. Greener day. If not tomorrow then other day. We just need to breath 💆🏻‍♂️
1614884489,damn trading would be so much easier with infinite initial capital
1614884519,bots hungry
1614884556,buy all dip then more dip money over can't buy more dip
1614884591,"Well anything is easier with infinite initial capital, that's basically capitalism 101 :D"
1614884743,rofl ada mooning it 😄
1614884755,"DOCK looks promising 5x by june 2021 after its use PoS testnet, has anyone holdin on Dock?"
1614884802,Yeah mooning to south pole
1614884815,hahaha noooo to north one 😄
1614884831,she already recovered twice then most coins from what i see
1614884935,Actually if you have infinite capital you don't need to invest anything 🙂
1614884948,from what I can see a few things shit the bed so buy opp for those of use with some capital
1614884981,I guess that's the joke 🙂 Can also someone tell us beforehand where the curves will go thank you
1614885003,The curves will probably go to the right
1614885006,Ada touched MA 20 on daily
1614885013,"So, well..."
1614885854,What happened with CHZ
1614886029,what i expected
1614886095,at #🍆frat-chat this guy asked for somebody to stop him from buying at the top
1614886100,hope he didnt do it
1614886320,You mean why it grew so much?
1614886788,What does this mean
1614886808,it can be a support/resistance zone
1614886820,i bought a tiny bag in case it goes up
1614887013,sorry to say that current enj retracement highly likely to take down to 1.12 area from the looks of things
1614887048,maybe even lower
1614887106,What?!? Crypto doesn't always go up. BigSad
1614887127,$1 buy in?
1614887131,trying to break it gently to the nubs
1614887166,It was a pretty insane call btw. You called it really early on! I didn't participate in it as I had too many other positions and don't like spreading thin but great call nonetheless!
1614887234,if it goes that low you dont wanna buy anyway as that would be a trend break/possible reversal
1614887252,Hot damn
1614887257,Good shout
1614887285,0.69$ when you made the call->1.51$ it its peak
1614887290,thats really nice profits
1614887379,"Hmm ok, move away from ENJ"
1614887384,To where 🤔
1614887407,Lots of good options while BTC is dropping. Sales everywhere!!!
1614887420,Name me some
1614887427,ATOM?
1614887455,MATIC is also low
1614887461,Take a gamble on Skye
1614887520,I personally am only doing big longs this week as I don't have much time thanks to work. I am longing ETH and BTC 10x during these sale times in hopes to make bank when things go back up
1614887577,Been really into futures this week as its not something I have too dedicate too much time to. Just keeping in eye on my margin amount and liq point compared to market price
1614887633,My exit points on both are 2k and 55k respectively and liquid points are 1317 and 44000
1614887681,hopefully in the next 2 weeks I will hit my exit points and this weekend I plan on doing standard trading again while those longs do their thing
1614888252,Enj good to enter now i think
1614888408,I’ve topped  up my to a 100 🙂
1614889329,Pass me a dollar so I can invest in some doge on the dip 😘
1614889352,scrub
1614889366,💀💀😪
1614889519,More shorts than longs for Bitcoin
1614890410,"yeah, i wanted to know why CHZ just went 70%"
1614890443,https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/product-release/chiliz-chz-plans-50-million-u-s-expansion/
1614890498,thx. very cool news
1614890662,We already have enough Chilis here in America. They always spam my inbox with free appetizers
1614891663,Whos bullish on $RSR
1614891814,ada's time soon?
1614891931,ENJ is pumping
1614891934,Not dead yet
1614891934,Eth found support.
1614891947,long term eth going again for 2000.
1614892001,Sold all at 2040tho
1614892005,xD
1614892106,Im ready! I'll make 1500 when it hits there
1614892118,I'm salivating already at the gains
1614892120,Nice
1614892136,Profiters are investing in other coins
1614892160,I expect 1800 in next 15 days to 20
1614892210,Post grad estimated ATH in the next week or so. Really would be glad to see that happen
1614892235,We'll see
1614892294,Longs are kinda hard to estimate timeframes for as crypto is so volatile
1614892324,Thats why I am just letting it do its thing and am going to do some basic trading starting tomorrow(payday)
1614892384,"thanks, made a quick 3$ 😄"
1614892397,I bought 20 eth when it was 100
1614892403,sold at 2040
1614892424,She blows again
1614892459,Thats real nice! I owned 1 ETH till a few weeks ago. I sold pieces of it at different times. Now I dont buy so much of a coin and instead just abuse leverage on the future system
1614892496,Plan to get 32 and invest it in ETH 2.0
1614892513,Its a lot easier to put 450$ on the line to get 3 ETH then put 4500 on the line for the same amount without leverage
1614892535,the people who make the most in crypto use futures leverage
1614892539,or have been in since day 1
1614892543,No pain no gain mate
1614892581,"Honestly even 2x leverage is useful for those who are worried. Think about it this way, with 2x leverage at 50k BTC, you arent liquidated till 25k"
1614892630,I dont see BTC dropping that drastically tbh
1614892699,25k + margin you deposit right?
1614892949,That ENJ pump made me 800 dollar
1614892950,Yes but with 2x you honestly dont need any ADDED margin so just the maintenance margin would be added
1614892959,Phew saved me out :’)
1614893065,"So 25,325$ would be the full price tag of 1 BTC at 2x if BTC was at 50,000"
1614893073,hmm ok
1614893091,"btw, do you guys think ADA could get a huge drop?"
1614893111,maybe the higher prices would have been just hype
1614893117,just thinking
1614893141,"but wouldnt actually make sense, also IOHK is getting closer to get the africa deals sealed right?"
1614893151,Its one of the biggest and most off it is stacked
1614893165,Should be pretty “stable”
1614893343,Apparently according to Binance I was wrong with my margin calculations. required maintenance margin is 100.40 USDT
1614893380,"I hand did my calculations but according to their liq calculator, I was wrong"
1614893675,50% up from here again. One more time and I'll be (almost) back to where I started 😄
1614893747,Thats what we like to see! Once ETH gets back to 2k I will have finally made profits on futures. Right now I am still trying to make up for my poor futures entry with better decision making
1614893761,-600$ is a lot to make up when you are only investing 300$ at a time tho
1614893796,"Remember everyone, if you are new to futures, take it slow or face the same fate I did of being liquidated on my first futures trade"
1614893820,I got liquidated several times before i actually start making profits with it
1614893824,You can always increase leverage later. start with 2-5x and work your way up when you get comfortable with the market
1614893826,So Jeremy is right
1614893840,"I got liquidated once today and that felt quite unfair. This was just a brief dip for a minute, before the position would have reached my tp some 5 min later 😦"
1614893842,And i do not suggest even if you are pro trader or not dont go above 5x
1614893851,Now I know better what to pay attention to to prevent this in the future.
1614893852,go gamble for football is better then >5x
1614893856,"(hehe, 'future')"
1614893869,10x is safe if you use isolated margins with added margin
1614893883,but getting comfortable with isolated margins is the tricky part
1614893902,the rule of thumb is 20x+ is legally gambling
1614893905,But if you gamble on football you lose your entire wager if your bet is wrong
1614893925,"Yeah but better safe than sorry ""1 tiny little negative news with 10x"" boom you got liquidated or stop loss will trigger"
1614893949,Thats why you add to your margin until it gets far enough from your liq to be comfortable
1614893961,I will probably have added margin to my ETH until we hit 1800
1614893965,then Ill take profits out of margin
1614893976,That's what I have learned today. 🧠
1614894017,Its kinda counter intuitive so its a learning curve. My strat is 50% 10x and 50% added margin until I feel liq is too safe
1614894041,im for sure gonna try 5x next time
1614894051,this is like a fly around my ear
1614894097,ya you get greedy after you start using leverage! Just care and dont get too greedy. Thats what bit me in the ass
1614894120,yeah and i went at 1.16 into a lil ada leverage
1614894125,i should trust the call i made
1614894130,the 1.05-1 one
1614894156,but i got paper hands to use the money
1614894163,Its really hard to stick to your calls but its worth it. I question my calls constantly especially when I start seeing green
1614894166,I always preach that greed is the root of (literally) all evil and now I also have personal anecdotes to illustrate this with 👌
1614894207,"like I saw +400$ yesterday and I so wanted to close my position and looking back now, I prob should have but my plan was wait till 2k and I stuck to it"
1614894211,https://tenor.com/view/gekko-gordongekko-greed-good-lackofabetterword-gif-4994861
1614894221,i think more like this guy
1614894247,"Now I am looking at it now and its only +100 but thats ok because I am still sticking to my plan. Once ETH hits 2k which I am confident it will, I will be +1500"
1614894267,"I made the plan, I am sticking with it"
1614894270,with paper hands you are physically unable to act upon your greed
1614894332,I feel like I had paper hands with trading. Futures has kinda cured that for me
1614894342,I dont have diamond hands but I at least have iron hands
1614894347,and thats strong enough for me
1614894402,"Then you got greedy, 400$ free money was not enough and you had to watch it melt away 😦"
1614894446,Its not melting away. Its just taking a breather. Onward to 2k ETH
1614894465,What's your time horizon?
1614894484,Im hoping we gain fuel in the next few days and start the climb. Im expecting 2-3 weeks
1614894505,Right now BTC is just a battle ground so its hard to say for sure
1614894554,Bulls vs bears. Its very neck and neck. You can tell even post grads are questioning this fight as they are switching the direction they thing its going to go
1614894602,This squeeze will kinda decide whats going to happen with ETH. They don't have a 1:1 relationship but ETH is def effected by BTC
1614894613,Decision day!
1614894635,Big fun! Deciding whether I will celebrate and drink or be sad and drink
1614894693,what do you mean?
1614894708,There is a squeeze happening with BTC
1614894711,its in post grad
1614894716,uh

1614897456,🤣
1614897478,Je m'confirmez mon email tout de suite
1614897484,are you expecting price goes high on following weeks after ICO ends? or we should expect when it gets to an exchange
1614897486,😂😂👍🏽
1614897499,with Swiss tokens.. do you Yield ? would you recommend  putting them to Yeild?
1614897511,For me this project will explode from end of ico to end of year
1614897519,Depends on the project if the project works well mad profits if it fails and burn. Losses
1614897532,Alternatively
1614897534,Bitconnect
1614897536,as I udenrstood its like ADA u can pull out any time ( after 24 hours) and sale your Swiis tokens if need be?
1614897536,I yield and recommend to yield
1614897558,Yes
1614897564,Man imagine if you got into bitconnect early and sold before the death
1614897572,So many gains
1614897583,good to know! makes it safe not lockef for weeks and mont.. also small profit 🙂
1614897593,Guys XSL is a crazy project that give back ppl control of their own data
1614897600,What network should i use to pay for XSL with BTC ?
1614897606,You refering to Swiss tokens?:)
1614897609,No LTC
1614897616,where can i find the confirmation that ICO ends on 31 march?
1614897618,Better to pay LTC the xsl
1614897620,LTC better ?
1614897623,or it could move
1614897626,Faster and cheaper
1614897627,Litecoin has cheaper fees
1614897646,No i was referring to XSL but for sure Swissborg also and it is on going
1614897662,Which is obvious since it was meant to be a faster cheaper bitcoin
1614897692,Does ltc still have any development going? Last time i read ltc news the founder left
1614897719,need some of that 🙂 XSL
1614897732,where do I buy it?
1614897746,https://www.xsl-labs.io/en/
1614897812,https://www.xsl-labs.io/syl?access=12735
1614897843,This project would propose to make money with your own data
1614897847,So in the future@
1614897857,If a company want to use your private data
1614897862,You have to accept
1614897867,And they have to pay
1614897883,Otherwise it will be only a private key in the blockchain
1614897885,Unique
1614897890,looking in to to in as we speak:) need to jump on train:)
1614897899,sounds like data harvesting to me
1614897907,Slowly but surely
1614897920,Its only one example of the features they propose
1614897956,and about this lad?
1614898000,"I am not a financial advisor but i like innovation behind crypto and love the community here so we could discuss hour about strategies
Then at least ppl should have strategies and then expectation also"

1614898103,"also it doens task name or what not.. is it like ada? ""incognito""?"
1614898108,xsl is a long bet i assume? @felguerr
1614898144,"No.
Kyc is mandatory to see your buy in your wallet"
1614898164,Yes not at all short. I mean not for the moment

1614898244,😉
1614898249,Haha
1614898257,sorry for silly quesiton... 100k would be enough?:))

1614898272,if 2000x take a screenshot of this i go buy someone from this discord a good old 2014 lambo
1614898275,what would we expect to rerunr??
1614898277,That kind of question are impossible to give answer
1614898301,"how much do you expect this coin to go up? i know this is kind of crystal-ball-foreseeing, but i just want to know a range (or minimum) that is on your mind"
1614898301,There is my opinon
1614898308,in reality doble is good enough not a loss:)
1614898316,Look guys
1614898325,looking!:)👀
1614898332,If anybody here or on youtube give you price prediction
1614898339,They are lying
1614898370,Xsl hasn't been listed on any exchange yet. Is it because it's a really recent project?
1614898389,On ICO for the moment
1614898403,"> Merci pour votre achat
> 
> Votre achat de 100638.136485 SYL a bien été validé.
> 
> Merci de votre confiance."
1614898426,is kinda weird tho
1614898436,"if Xsl isnt in any exchange, who puts the price on it"
1614898437,"Yes, just was wondering if you got any idea about it. Know you trust their fundamentals, you expect it to go up, its impossible to predict, and I also can imagine you might not say anything because you could manipulate people into buying it or not depending on your opinion."
1614898441,Merci de faire commerce avec toi! 😉
1614898445,My expectation is that we could make x100 at least. Why ? Cuz it is psychological and cuz bags are investing in it
1614898458,The coin name will be $SYL apparently.
1614898472,Yours came instant ?
1614898478,What are you saying ??? ICO and phase management + burn tokenomics
1614898478,"yup, paid with LTC"
1614898486,Me 2 and still waiting
1614898496,"I'm still deciding whether i join or not, doing some research on leisure time, but also would like to know more about what's inside people that goes on the long runs of coins"
1614898498,now they want KYC 🙂
1614898503,XSL gonna 1000x ?
1614898504,Gooooooood
1614898513,like

1614898561,In the long term it could
1614898573,Like CHSB
1614898598,Project with a product will all explode in the long term
1614898614,Project with bullshit could only explode by phase during bull market
1614898625,Cuz gamblers doesnt care about project
1614898637,They just manipulate the market to attract
1614898657,"Wallet
336 639
SYL"

1614898730,will we ever see 43k dip again ?
1614898735,like at the cheapest price without getting rap with the fees
1614898756,i wouldnt think it is a mad idea to see that again
1614898762,I've searched about long shorts on btc
1614898767,and if btc goes below 36.800
1614898776,including 5x and higher leverages will liquidated
1614898787,Lol dont you understand a ico?
1614898796,I think he doesnt
1614898805,But is normal it could happen
1614898820,FUCK IT

1614898874,Are you saying to do the age old move of money laundering through swiss? 👀
1614898874,"I change my french driver licence to the swiss one,"
1614898879,No metrics
1614898890,In france i could drive 200km
1614898893,Price prediction for XSL?
1614898894,No pb
1614898917,There is no price prediction
1614898917,"Says ""exchanges price 0.003"" but it's on ICO?"
1614898926,I am going in with 2k. I calculated. I am still way good for my financials
1614898928,🧐🧐👀👀🚨🚨

1614899024,Lets travel back to time
1614899029,And i can be a first comer aswell
1614899047,Dont take risk this time if you are not comfortable. Just wait and see and then you will decide for the next ico opportunities
1614899067,where do u find ico opportunities? u just google it?
1614899086,i am surprised ICOs are still happening. thought they got cracked down hard.
1614899103,so is a scam then
1614899105,?
1614899119,There is a lot of website on ico
1614899121,https://icodrops.com
1614899129,if you knew how to do futures you would know :kekw:
1614899162,"I'm just confused as it says it's still on ICO until end of month, but then says it's on exchanges?"

1614899207,https://tenor.com/view/aww-yeah-yess-you-got-it-swiss-swissbanks-gif-12580685
1614899211,you don't know what a ICO is so eh
1614899211,If you go faster than that in Switzerland you'll be in France again before you know it
1614899269,Correct 😂
1614899329,be careful kanye. the coin might be on the ETH network :kekwcoin:
1614899340,Just mean that the phase 3 price would be the exchange price but token will be burn at the end of ico depending of the sales
1614899357,For the futures on binance
1614899361,How long can i keep my position ?
1614899365,Is there a limit ?
1614899372,forever or until liquidation i think
1614899372,just get ur coins on metamask? lol
1614899374,not that hard
1614899382,they cant steal them from u there

1614899490,No but like there is no limit right ? Even if i bought from 0.01 and it goes to 1$ doesnt matter right?
1614899492,I can keep my position ?
1614899495,"XSL website translation module is broken. One page English, sign-up form English, email verification French, return page French...."
1614899519,AFAIK yes you can keep the position
1614899534,ty

1614899609,"nah you just have to set it at english at main site, then reload"
1614899618,there probably is some dead coin that already has XSL
1614899637,
1614899666,"Oui, they lure you in with the English but I couldn't switch it back after signup. When I did, I wasn't logged in anymore and they wanted me to register again."
1614899671,"people has been talking about this coin for like a week, and to be bought at the site. Price is ONLY there"
1614899673,Luckily I'm good at French. Also the language.
1614899675,Ok i am down i should not share potential gems in ICO phase. Most ppl looks not comfortable with that subject....
1614899708,"Yeh, I'm wary of ICOs since 2018. But if SwissCryptoBanker says it's good, I'ma jump in."
1614899715,nooooo. don't be discouraged by idiots like kanye
1614899722,"In case it goes south, we drive to Switzerland and look for his gold stash."
1614899722,where do u buy it? whats the website

1614899763,Bitcoin Master Race
1614899770,"i found some sites to find current and future ICOs, but having your point of view is priceless"

1614900140,"Yes, felguerr **promised** us 37k!!"
1614900141,man if u are day trading u are pretty bad at it @Güneş
1614900142,"ça me dérange pas, étant français c'est plutôt sympa même"
1614900142,"Crazy i dont know how to react.
@Kayne what are you expecting from me ? Giving you profit ? Create account for you ? Being the help desk of xsl ? Telling you the price will be 100$ next month ?"
1614900148,How do you sign up for SYL KYC when country of residence field is completely empty??
1614900165,Manage his pf
1614900173,"relax man, im just saying what do u even do there"

1614900198,Wrong bro it is
1614900201,"Yeah, SwissCryptoBanker is a fraud. he can't even predict DOGE price to the decimal for perfect entry and exit points 😄"
1614900215,Doge is free money
1614900215,Ok sorry my mistake
1614900223,just do future 100x as soon as elon musk tweets

1614900239,What a strategy !!!!!!
1614900239,"also translating to english, the field below the phone number translates to ""Number and Wording of The Track""."
1614900250,anyone can translate that field properly?
1614900257,Street and Number
1614900259,Street number and name
1614900282,"thanks guys lol, i was trying to decipher what does the translation mean 😄"
1614900290,what's xsl website? coinmarketcap link in the bio redirects me to a no domain
1614900290,yeah i only see fraud around his persona 💀
1614900299,French doesnt need to translate 😂
1614900310,french isn't even a real language anyway
1614900313,https://www.xsl-labs.io
1614900317,thank u
1614900324,French girls...
1614900349,is this link wrong? 🤔
1614900365,That's the wrong XSL on cmc
1614900371,Guyssss who are now buying have you ever read the whitepaper !!!!!!!??????
1614900384,"no, sorry... I replied to the reply you were replying to"
1614900384,"I don't read whitepapers, it's racist"
1614900398,But you're reading the black letters where the info is
1614900400,so it's all good
1614900406,Mine has a trailing /m/ : https://www.xsl-labs.io/m/
1614900411,But that probably doesn't change much
1614900412,white background is just there serving the black man's letters
1614900417,the site is so sketchy
1614900419,mobile link
1614900422,im french even tho i pressed english
1614900426,But i'm on a desktop 😂
1614900431,need email to verify but no email arrived
1614900441,They call it SYL and it's not (yet) on cmc
1614900453,The email will come when you make some futures on doge x50
1614900464,That's their way of saying baise moi
1614900473,why is it in french
1614900474,tho
1614900487,Because french are super smart on technical
1614900496,Because XSL will slowly but s urely take over all private data
1614900496,but they lost every war
1614900498,When I registred it also said something in French but then I logged in and change in toEnglish 🙂 the rest was easy:). Now I have  my beg. the cheapest I got. figers crossed 🙂 lets wait and see:)
1614900501,and every goverment is useless
1614900502,And then we'll force you to all speak French
1614900504,Which war ?
1614900509,And make fun of you for not speaking it properly
1614900511,"2nd war, uk war"
1614900514,it goes on and on
1614900516,Pfffff
1614900518,Lol
1614900523,how many did the french win in comparison
1614900524,france is a fucking war titan
1614900535,do u pay with metamask i assume
1614900536,?
1614900542,You really dont know the behind the scene  and geopolitical
1614900549,"Crypto only, guys"
1614900551,lost in 2 days lol
1614900559,But stop crypto only
1614900561,👍🏽
1614900564,"yeah, my bad"
1614900570,"yeah, stop dude, crypto only"
1614900589,"as i said, seems the site could fix that thing"
1614900591,I am sorry i dont use to talk with troll or shit
1614900598,So i am not able to detect them
1614900606,im not a troll lmao
1614900608,"might be some kind of error, but it can be easily bypassed"
1614900612,just people say that bc i dont believe in eth
1614900627,Interesting ? Why you dont ?
1614900632,"have the main site opened also, and you'll be able to properly switch"
1614900633,"a currency with infinite supply is never good, Eth is the case"
1614900649,Wait wait wait
1614900650,thats why... we use... dollars and euros?
1614900654,"the only reason, in my opinion, that is gonna up so much is bc is the backbone of all the altcoins and such"
1614900660,i dont believe in eth because i dont understand gas fees and the 40$ worth of coins i have on metamask are eternally stuck there
1614900665,also that
1614900676,eth fees are crazy
1614900677,France won 1115 battles 😉
1614900680,Eth before being a currency is a blockchain
1614900703,"as Dwight from the office said, ""money isnt real since we left gold standard"""
1614900715,:chad:
1614900722,"Stop guys please if you talk about ETH....
Dont"
1614900730,Ask @Post Grad  or @IllegalSkillsException
1614900740,"dont worry, they are working to updating to eip 1559 which will make fees a flat $3 roughly 🙂"
1614900741,Expert will explain you
1614900743,so? Doge is also that
1614900749,No
1614900754,what is it then
1614900760,is part of the blockchain too
1614900762,it uses eth
1614900763,all that
1614900781,If you were talking about scalability velocity interoperability
1614900788,I will agree
1614900797,If you are comparing erc20
1614900798,Token
1614900804,To coin
1614900809,I will understand
1614900813,exactly
1614900815,But what is your argument
1614900823,why would anyone believe in something with this many flaws
1614900830,and putting in 2# in the crypto space is so stupid
1614900838,when there are better alternatives
1614900840,No but sorry even with all that bad point
1614900845,For the moment eth is huge
1614900859,"bc is used on tokens, erc-20, etc"
1614900861,Cardano has only launch mary l
1614900868,is only huge bc u need to buy eth to buy any altcoin
1614900871,And dot is ongoing
1614900874,which itself inflates the coin
1614900878,Naaaaaa
1614900881,Omg
1614900887,btc is not that way
1614900893,"""only""... these guys built the fucking platform that all the scamcoins and shitcoins need to exist"
1614900893,Eth is huge cuz it support smart contract
1614900895,and thats why is the future of crypto
1614900906,"yeah man, scamcoins and shitcoins are so great"
1614900910,"mary 1? wasnt this the second update? or maybe I am wrong, and this pack of updates was only the first part of Mary?"
1614900915,you just prove my point
1614900929,BTC will not be dominant forever
1614900930,is only so big as number 2# bc of that
1614900934,My mistake i forgot to delete this letter
1614900938,if not it would be another shitcoin honestly
1614900949,What are you saying
1614900954,like if nano would have a 25% fee when sending it no one would buy it
1614900967,but everyone buys eth bc is the base of all shitcoins/altcoins
1614900977,How do i go to bed without putting stop loss ? just because makers will put a needle there and it will go up again which i lose my profits after it
1614900990,"if they were made on other platform, eth would be useless, aka another shitcoin with absurd fees"
1614900996,@Kayne please lets organized your point
1614901012,Could you separate technical point of view to trading
1614901018,"Only reason that eth is not a shitcoin, is bc all the shitcoins/alts are made from there."
1614901023,"If not, it would be another shitcoin"
1614901024,lol eth will be king. just watch
1614901024,Not at all
1614901029,Nano example
1614901033,.
1614901033,Omg
1614901058,"bc if nano has that 25% fee but not altcoins are made with it, it would plummet and stay that way"
1614901063,nano is trash
1614901064,"In fact eth has a lot of issue : security issue, scalability etc"
1614901077,And the risk of 51% attack
1614901085,But as of today
1614901112,Eth is the backbone of smartcontract and all erc20token
1614901120,"also eth fee is not 25%, its a flat rate"
1614901122,Ada and dot are far far
1614901137,yup
1614901142,but look at matic 😉
1614901148,listen man
1614901162,if u are saying that btc is gonna not be number 1 in terms of price forever
1614901167,u are weird
1614901167,Yep look my call on matic weeks ago on the podium post grad channel 😉
1614901177,#1 in price does not mean #1 in gains tho
1614901179,no coin even comes close to it
1614901185,.....
1614901188,1# in price = most used
1614901189,so
1614901190,best layer 2 project rn imo 🙂
1614901202,I think so
1614901203,wrong
1614901226,"nano and matic have became almost stable coins, no movement in the week so far"
1614901230,at least important wise
1614901331,@Kayne could you explain difference between coin and token ? Layer 1 and layer 2 ?
1614901345,Its just funny to look at unexperienced goon pretend he knows it all
1614901353,IOTA is stable in that case... and someone told me it will make good move soon UP!
1614901380,coin= actual crypto with stuff that backs it up
1614901383,Watch the next 20 mins cos the woke of Japan about to wake up
1614901408,token= 200$ coin i can do myself in 5 mins and i can scam anyone with it by selling all my % in any secoind

1614907233,
1614907335,man. i wish i had some busd ready so I could get a buy of ada at like 0.9
1614907367,what is the bottom? of btc and alts
1614907380,0$
1614907391,^
1614907604,@felguerr be proud.
1614909219,How many points have you got? 🙂
1614909231,none
1614909234,i just downloaded the app
1614909243,its too late to do KYC and setting it up
1614909255,got just onder 90K of SYL tho
1614909261,need to set up casper tomorrow
1614909264,buy some swissborg
1614909264,There's an easy 200/400 points to be had on an upward BTC tick I reckon 😉
1614909280,i genuinely have no idea what you are talking about mate
1614909306,does swissborg do futures and shit. Looking at the website it looks like quite the extensive stuff
1614909374,The Swissborg community app is essentially a forecasting game where you pledge points on an upward or downward projection over a 24hr period. It's not very interesting tbh. Lovely UI though.
1614909405,but is everything through an app since the website seems that the whole thing is app based
1614909419,I've never been on the site - only the app.
1614909463,(and I'm only using the community app not the trading app as I prefer binance)
1614912014,I think BTC is finally calming down. Im not holding my breath but crossing my fingers that the carnage is over
1614912663,i hope so
1614913660,Curious what makes you think this? I picked some up a couple of days ago because it looked interesting.
1614914087,ADA PLS
1614914097,"What are you doing, ma'am"
1614915092,this dip is p cool imo
1614915105,been itching to add to my ADA bag
1614915116,I sold my ada and added it to Nano
1614915122,glad I did :kekwcoin:
1614919628,tfw nfi what to do with my bags rn
1614919631,down $150 today rip
1614920067,HOLD!
1614920107,buy*
1614920113,buy everything
1614920229,kinda cbf putting more dosh in
1614920231,just gonna hold
1614920235,still up overall
1614923103,"Barely, just barely in the green for yesterday! Includes some margin trading wins, too."
1614923161,"awesome, not many can relate"
1614923549,Hey my red is getting smaller
1614923569,-200 out of 806
1614923595,was 260 earlier
1614923625,"My day is starting red as well, down 300"
1614923638,Ill cross my fingers for the both of us
1614923654,Im also buyin the dip in about 15 minutes when my ACH payroll hits my account 😍
1614923714,"I got 100,000 more SYL than yesterday though, that's gonna be awesome in a couple of months"
1614923733,Im just tryna get my tesla over here 😭
1614923790,2022 will be my break year from crypto where I just put some crypto in a wallet and forget about it. 2021 is all about making those big trades to get the tesla
1614924611,nah im just gonna hit a yolo or two and be set
1614924619,u can do it in a few weeks @Jeremyfto
1614924748,or be broke in a few weeks
1614924762,if u wanna do it fast u gotta risk
1614924769,i wish cz followed me
1614924771,🥺
1614926571,ADA nice uptick the last 30mins
1614926873,was looking for $1 entry point
1614926966,Don’t think it’ll get that low just because that’s lower than 70% of ATH. Would have to be something dramatic to go lower
1614927072,It actually got within .1 of a cent of that 70% lol
1614929404,I think we need to go over 48k to break his downward channel on BTC.
1614929565,I think we need to touch 43k to start going up in healthy mood
1614931305,Next downphase is taking a bit longer so far
1614932330,I got my 100k. My biggest bag for lowest price :).  Fingers crossed it’s the best one 🙂
1614932717,what is the max SYL did they say? like total possible circulation?
1614933826,I think they say it on website
1614933834,10 with many zeros lol
1614933937,It says 3 million available at the price that we paid.
1614933973,Total I think 10 million.
1614934001,Also it say all undistrebuted will not be issued. That I suppose is good /)
1614934033,Sorry it’s not millions it’s billions 💆🏻‍♂️ still sippin my coffee
1614934201,10 billion maxish isn't too bad if you look at other coins like ada that is what? 40-50 billion in circulation?
1614934257,but the usecase of ADA is different no?
1614934266,yeah.
1614934288,Looks like “smart project”. We might be on something. Thanks to Swiss 🧀
1614934289,but still. buying at what we bought it at we should be able to get a profit rather easy
1614934305,U can’t get cheaper.
1614934318,My cheapest and biggest bag 💼
1614934320,well we could. with the previous tier :virgin:
1614934348,Lol what’s 0.002 cents extra for future profits 🙂
1614934363,Still@0.003 is good call. Could be 0.03 🙂
1614934382,its 3 times the price. that is a 3X in profit :godsgardener:
1614934414,If it goes to 3 cents x10 what I paid. It will be good profit already. Not to mention 0.30 or 1$
1614934447,True but it is what it is 🙂 im@happy with 0.003 and hopefull 💵💼
1614934472,lol at one dollar i would have nearly 90K
1614934475,that would be....insane
1614934481,The best part. I have it and I’ll forget it for a few month. Not going to lose my hair worried with red candles lol
1614934532,Me too. Im taking my family holidays!!!! And myself around the world. Woth stop over where ever Swiss based to give him box of what ever he likes lol
1614934545,hopefully they don't exit scam
1614934583,need to get my KYC in order today for casper
1614934604,Fingers crossed. And somehow I feel Swiss knows what he saying and seeing. And if it would smell im@sure he would see it. Though even smart guys get scammed but Swiss seem very smart and mature Swiss 🧀🤣
1614934638,What’s Casper and is it for new coin?
1614934655,https://blog.coinlist.co/how-casper-accelerates-blockchain-adoption-in-enterprise/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter03032021&utm_term=read%20more
1614934663,funding a start up is never a sure thing :p
1614934677,Here is a good article about casper
1614934735,It’s a coin that will be on pre sale on 23/30 march
1614934776,Cool.
1614934884,Seems good price.
1614934897,What lock up u looking at?
1614934910,And what’s ur expectations? Scam profit risk?
1614934945,I think you can find info in the post grads podium about it
1614935135,Well i am going for both option 1 and option 3.
1614935219,I see second one is 50k min lol@if I have 50k I don’t need Casper lol
1614935252,Coinlist is a platform that does good research on the coins they launch. They have had 15 launches in total and all of them were not a scam
1614935263,Also 11/15 were launched on binance
1614935314,I have FOMO when you talk about it
1614935315,And most of them had great returns
1614935320,I really need to register :p
1614935356,The fact that other projects have been launched on binance or performed well doesn’t necessarily mean casper will
1614935373,I think you just have to park some profits into it
1614935381,and assume it can just be a total fail
1614935421,But personally i believe in their fundamenals. They have a great team and the article that i sent you above only made my beliefs stronger
1614935485,Casper is the most registered coin launch on coinlist so far. I really hope they change something in their purchase system. Otherwise I think it  can be a close call for most of us
1614935493,Since it is first come first serve
1614935545,What language is the website in jelle
1614935550,Im@not selling my cloth for it lol will buy few hundred usd. Will@not hurt. Might be good. If not xyl could help to cover and if not Ada with time. And if not. Oh well. Se la vie 🙂
1614935561,What website?
1614935575,I went from English to french it seems and xsl
1614935583,se la vie? :p
1614935590,Syl is also a really good project
1614935603,https://blog.coinlist.co/how-casper-accelerates-blockchain-adoption-in-enterprise/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter03032021&utm_term=read%20more
1614935611,This one is english about casper
1614935626,The other one was in English too lol
1614935649,why would a dutch person link a french website
1614935656,XSL
1614935659,Labs
1614935659,thats not a good combo of languages :p
1614935679,Je parle francais aussi😉
1614935687,It’s changed to french
1614935705,But I registered and it was in English
1614935708,You can change it in the menu
1614935740,Cause French is the best. 🤣 no matter we don’t speak it. Submit!! Start learning. To pull coins out t we might need to pass French exam later on lol
1614935755,are you also giving me a FOMO on XSL now
1614935756,sigh
1614935766,👌🏻
1614935804,Ahhhh figured it
1614935821,i bought nearly 90K SYL :kekw:
1614935824,SYL to the moon
1614935834,90k euro?
1614935835,nice
1614935837,90k usd?
1614935840,you are a believer
1614935842,no 90K SYL
1614935852,how much is that in BTC?
1614935857,if I had 90K USD laying around I would of bought into ada at like 70 cents and be happy
1614935860,i bought in LTC
1614935865,250 usd
1614935878,U bought at 0.003?
1614935881,yes
1614935890,i was too busy with work and missed 2
1614935929,Now I need to do Casper after I’ve done this cause if I miss one more post grad call 😡
1614935957,I got 1500 euro on the way to invest in stuff.
1614935958,"I want to buy more. But cant afford it for now, since casper is coming as well😶"
1614935987,probably going to do 200 on option 1 and 300 on option 3
1614935999,swissborg I am buying like 400 euro off
1614936002,and just let it sit
1614936037,If i miss out on casper i buy more xsl
1614936043,probably fill some more nano and ada
1614936057,I need to put more in my Nano bag
1614936058,because ada and nano suprised me by not going under 1 dollar and 5 dollar
1614936109,anything I am missing from postgrad jelle?
1614936111,Good plan 🙂
1614936129,Me 100-200 :)) and fingers crossed

1614936286,I dont have link in my portfolio
1614936292,"lessons learned, when/if there is a new bear cycle"
1614936299,I really need to load up 😂
1614936353,IOTA is moving 😎😁
1614936386,not expecting much movement untill BTC decides what to do
1614936405,and since I am not in stablecoin lets hope its not retesting the lower 40k range :p
1614936419,Hopefully BtC calms the f down. The reds makes my heart sink
1614936439,I also jumped back on the ENJ train
1614936446,hoping for a ENJ spike :p
1614936453,cmon JAPAN you can do it
1614936508,oh ocean is on binance nice

1614936588,so we can buy it there? no need to pre sale register?
1614936633,I remember when we thought jelle was just some coin shiller for a bps pump how times change
1614936633,ocean does look like a interesting project
1614936635,way over my head
1614936679,its 1USD alread... i cant see 0.3 cents..  or its the wrong one?:)
1614936721,he bought it at 3 cents
1614936740,I bought at 30 cents
1614936752,"thanks ""He"" lol could have shouted at.0.30 lol"

1614937256,https://hsvgts.medium.com/why-i-decided-to-invest-in-ocean-protocol-c3b792572de6
1614937271,This guy explains it quite well
1614937444,looks good:)
1614937567,I believe that ocean can help smaller companies compete with bigger companies by sharing their data.
1614938037,Iam ready for Casper 🙂 need to make some money before 29th of March 🙂
1614938060,thanks for mentioning it here. Fingers crossed!!!!
1614938535,is there any aspect of ocean that WE apply to. they are talking about data providers and blablbla but I doubt that is random joe like us
1614938633,What do you mean?
1614938957,well their whole thing is data trading and storage essentially right?
1614939000,so say i buy the oceans
1614939012,what then. just stake?
1614939022,its kinda confusing on what a normal token owner would do
1614939288,Go in price and u sale it later ? He got it 0.30 now it’s 1$...
1614939587,Yes you can stake it. Also the suppliers of data have to stake ocean to ensure the quality of their data. When a supplier commits fraud they lose the staked amount of ocean. And you use ocean to pay for the data
1614939919,Are there any major downsides to ocean?
1614940234,people not buying / using it
1614940244,buts that with every product I guess :p
1614940461,"Well, that is for you to decide. I believe in the project and did not come across any major downsides yet. They have a great team and great partnerships already. Now it is up to you to do your own research and decide whether ocean you believe ocean is a good investment."
1614940647,I can tell you why i think it is a great project and what made me invest in it. But in the end it is your money and if you see any red flags you shouldn’t buy it
1614940717,Something can be a major downside for you. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it is a major downside for me
1614940830,This is the case with every call from all the post grads. That is why we keep underlining that you have to do your own research.
1614941357,btc is doing a pausechamp right now
1614941378,steady ~47k for 10h now...
1614941386,where u going next I wonder
1614941415,Up?🤔
1614941436,"I think so too. not to an ATH, I think that may take a little longer"
1614941459,"but it's been defending 47k like an animal, I'd be surprised to see it suddenly drop"
1614941485,Still. Dragging up all the rest with it would be nice. I need to see green pastures not  hell fire
1614941497,"same man, same"
1614941593,"look at eth 1h, I've never seen such a consistent sideways movement lol"

1614950545,ENJ actually looks kinda ok to enter atm
1614950553,just for like an overnight thing
1614950568,I entered at 2500 btc pairing
1614950576,with a small stop loss
1614950587,it will shoot to 2900-3000 again or just tank :p
1614950714,i think itl be hard for it dip below 2.2k
1614950759,yea well I'm not banking on it long term
1614950771,I heard they are quite easy to mine in games
1614950795,Swiss borg is green lighted!  Bless Swiss 🤠💆🏻‍♂️
1614950796,oh jesus ENJ fees are stupid high as well
1614950810,"i think its not the worst long term, but im not focusing on that atm"
1614950814,only day trading for now
1614950822,and night trading
1614950822,i guess
1614950823,I’ll cover my Ada loses with it. Till Ada go back to going up 🙂
1614950833,Fock 1.160
1614950833,oh great i am not the only one without focus then 😂
1614950837,It grows

1614950902,justr over an hr ago
1614950906,Good i out my 1k to yeild other wise I’d be tempted to sale now 🙂
1614950907,the buy wall was broken
1614950912,and stop losses were triggered
1614950919,Microstragegy saved the day again
1614950919,and then it hit another lower buy wall
1614950923,They are doing this on purpose
1614950929,And im %100 sure that they will dump again at 52k
1614950951,"Then rebuy at 46-48k and then 1 more announcement "" we bought btc bla bla bla"" people will believe again XD"
1614950978,Will sale when it +50% and buy more later 🙂
1614951013,i have 3 decisions for tonight i guess
1614951045,"keep my btc as btc
enter ENJ for a night play
set an order and keep toying with SUN"
1614951164,gut is saying ENJ should be ok
1614951172,but ill half and half
1614951177,@felguerr lost so much on fees but whatever
1614951181,bruh
1614951188,BTC is doing whack
1614951194,ENJ has never been so stable the last days
1614951239,yield time
1614951296,Done !!!
1614951304,Forget it now
1614951360,that not even 50 is bugging me tho 😩
1614951426,Wick in the current candle beautifully stopping above the former trend line 😍
1614951456,got in enj @ 2.5k sats
1614951463,sell order set for 3k
1614951470,c ya in the morning
1614951551,"Nooo fck, I had an order at 2200 and I know I don´t have to put fix numbers, but I would have placed 2199 or less instead 😆  fck missed the dip"
1614951589,better late than never
1614951604,Next time I´m going to put +3 or 5 units over the price I want to get it :)))
1614951624,unfortunate
1614951639,i cant even count the number of times ive missed the dip by a mere hair
1614951652,and always overnight while im sleeping
1614951686,do you have a buy order in btc pair then or from stablecoin?
1614951711,"Yeah same here, and I let it at 2200 last night for the same thing, but it didn´t reached it"
1614951735,I have it at BTC pair
1614951778,"I know that might affect it if BTC makes big moves too, but didn´t cared during the night :))"
1614951812,thats my hope on the coin rn
1614951831,🙏
1614951834,"Go moon, Bitcoin!!"
1614951846,"At least I´m happy with my small bag of CHSB, while the others are red,  this one not hahah"
1614951851,https://tenor.com/view/shoo-go-away-johnny-depp-captain-jack-sparrow-gif-4877675
1614951857,oh yeah!
1614951862,Seems like going long should be the best idea here
1614951874,I am long already 😉
1614951878,"now is a good time, yes"
1614951887,I jumped in at 49k already 😄
1614951907,"same, been holding out for this moment"
1614951918,I hope we're at least able to break even
1614951922,close slightly above 48k for the last 15m candle
1614951933,do you plan on exiting at 49k or try risking it?
1614951936,I think this will turn into another uptrend now
1614951952,"No, I got long at 49k, need to go there to re-enter profit zone 😉"
1614951962,"ye ye, same here"
1614951964,"if it goes there, it will likely continue going up more"
1614951975,"ah okay, I hope so!"
1614951981,so I'm not exiting at 49k unless there's another clear downward action
1614952122,"this boy needs a new pair of shoes, btc"
1614952128,don't disappoint
1614952130,I entered at 48.250 so I hope it goes even higher than 49 so everyobody makes profit 😁
1614952204,Ada stable seems like slowly up few cents here and there. Phewww lol
1614952307,Alright just went long with ×5 leverage
1614952321,Let's hope for this new uptrend now
1614952516,ye

1614955467,"true, but lost half its volume, that puts me off a bit"
1614955468,you in a few hours
1614955475,Thoughts on btc dipping again tonight?
1614955574,I think 50k might be most challenging
1614955806,"With the 12 months lockup on casper, it means you won't be able to trade them until year passes? Anyone going for this or do you go for 0.03$?"
1614955856,you can split
1614955900,im doing option 1 and 3
1614956088,btc killed the surge :p
1614956458,got another green hour candle
1614956463,should be good to go
1614956473,"I don't think it will be a particular challenge, sure it's a special price and ppl will take profit there, but it could also surge right through it
More of interest will be 52k where we started the previous down wave"
1614956500,that's a really good point
1614956517,I was thinking 50k more psychologically but you're right
1614956533,"Told ya!
Don't be surprised, it will retract a bit in the next one or two hours because it's high in the Bolli band and RSI is also high on the 1h. Needs to cool off just a bit, don't freak out."
1614956578,"thanks for the advice, appreciate that"
1614956740,"sure, that's what I'm here for 🙂"
1614956972,I'm still not sure when to buy into BTC and BNB again
1614957003,Last days were pretty unstable
1614957202,"oh, BTC is good to go! Take any dip now and go long"
1614957220,I think we'll see a couple of thousands up before the next down wave
1614957227,any freak event notwithstanding of course
1614957267,so you are saying
1614957268,go 125x
1614957276,lmao
1614957286,Put your life savings there and within the month you'll lambo
1614957289,With all your life savings
1614957436,good thing I dont have any savings then 😂
1614957477,"@Lineout, show 'em whatcha got 😄"
1614957545,MicroStrategy just announced another BTC buy
1614957549,205 BTC
1614958000,I'm just happy with BTC even though it dropped
1614958015,Brought in at 35k
1614958023,And will sit on it until forever
1614958172,Ur not gonna sell high and wait to buy baxk in the crash?!? 👀
1614958186,Nope
1614958189,just holding forever is idk
1614958197,isnt that crazy? :p
1614958211,What if u could buy back at 26k?! 👀
1614958224,What if I sell and it goes up
1614958231,What if I sell and it never comes back down
1614958240,Its probably gonna crash at 100k
1614958243,in the bearmarket everything will come down
1614958245,no worries
1614958246,Probably
1614958246,😂
1614958250,Not definitely
1614958257,High chance
1614958266,Nice to buy back
1614958269,But i get u
1614958269,If it comes down. I'll just buy more
1614958271,Hodler
1614958276,At a lower cost and get my averages down
1614958294,well many off my friends have the same approach like you tbh
1614958295,I have coins I will attempt to sell at top and buy back
1614958313,But the large large majority I am not going to touch
1614958321,The best investor is a dead investor
1614958327,They can't touch the money
1614958344,Everytime I see a big dip coming
1614958352,"Actually no, a major dip"
1614958356,I sell my hodl coins
1614958366,And buy back near the same price i bought them for
1614958369,Risk
1614958372,😂
1614958374,But it usually pays off
1614958390,"I have two pots, one is a do not touch until I can cash out and retire"
1614958406,One is a play around money
1614958413,Profit from that goes to other pot
1614958437,Ahhh thats pretty nice ngl
1614958443,Im broke and schooling
1614958456,So I need another source of income
1614958462,So i be buying and selling
1614958473,I dont have money to just stash unfortunately
1614958477,Yet tho
1614958485,I am pretty lucky for work so I don't have to worry too much about money
1614958493,Just powering everything into coins atm
1614958525,Yeah thats a good strategy when ur good
1614958531,Easy retirement money
1614958536,U dont even need to stress
1614958554,Exactly. I wanna be sipping margaritas at 45+
1614958578,Yeah
1614958581,Some king shit
1614959203,-since when is margaritas king material
1614959366,bro i just wanna be able to buy a home
1614959469,Bro i just wanna buy a human
1614959506,I think focusing on my job would be more benifical then cryptos
1614959509,but less fun I guess
1614959520,"You have a wife, why don't you just make another human?"
1614959537,less taxxes
1614959550,Long-term hodling isn't the worst strat
1614959558,I lost a lot in Jan 2018 trying to beat the market
1614959589,I should've just held the 1 BTC I bought in Feb 2017 at $800
1614959593,could you even make money in 2018-2019 from crypto?
1614959597,now I have 0.3 BTC
1614959622,"sure, if you time the waves properly ... I mean it did go back up 10k at one point ... and then down again"
1614959690,well I should have just bought each month btc
1614959701,instead of giving up
1614959886,yes
1614959945,i should buy some eth every week
1614959948,get back to 1 eth
1614959950,and sit it out
1614959983,fuck me the ENJ hype is done again 😂

1614960298,I am in ENJ
1614960309,but BTC drags everything down lol
1614960440,47600 is still okay and in line with the trend
1614960541,BTC is retracting from the trend line like a shriveling penis
1614960660,So it looks like theres no second dip today?
1614960705,"well, the candle's not over yet and it's closing in again"
1614960719,"nothing's for certain, but for now I don't see the up wave in danger"
1614960746,"oops, there goes 47.6k"
1614960756,bears fighting hard

1614961870,load of horse shit innit
1614961900,"wait a bit more, until we don't go down 45k we're probably fine"
1614961908,at this point btc will need to dump to $1 to be safe to long it to a new ath lol
1614961919,yeah I'm still chilling
1614961936,Ur predicting btc falls even more? Past 47k?
1614961937,also alts seem to just not care about it at all
1614961956,they need time to deal with the PTSD from another BTC dump
1614961964,"I'm not predicting anything, just saying we don't have to panic until we don't fall to 45k"
1614961977,Okay
1614961980,"and even if we fall to 45k, no need to panic either"

1614962023,We’re not crashing chill
1614962024,"yeah sure, like we've been consolidating for 2 weeks for nothing"
1614962041,everything we love will wither and fall
1614962042,ITS ALL OVER
1614962044,TIME TO WAGECUCK
1614962054,i will have to return to my job at the steel mill
1614962067,"Ponzi's over, just short everything, time to get back at your mcdonald's shift fellas"
1614962234,Can I have that quarter raise you have promised me for the past 3 years sir?
1614962251,pretty please
1614962303,"sorry dude there's been a pandemic since, gotta reduce costs, you're fired"
1614962450,should I take a 50K loan and go APE
1614962471,"@HODLer i need to speak with you, enjin already own everything and nobody even knows yet"
1614962494,what i have is too big to comprehend
1614962563,:kekw:
1614962624,Sure but what's this new APE coin? I don't know it yet man
1614962638,they own the erc-1155 network
1614962677,ethereum owns the ERC-20 network
1614962689,I own the LOL-69 network
1614962704,Do I need a lot more ENJ by a certain time?
1614962708,i might buy some enj to hodl for curiousity sake
1614962754,they have fingers in everybody and are commencing stage 3 of a global takover
1614962764,everytime I see @bcdcdaz talking on the chat
1614962777,this plan has been 10 years in the making
1614962787,https://tenor.com/view/chappelles-show-dave-chappelle-chappelles-tyrone-tyrone-biggums-gif-4958017
1614962795,Y'all got summa that ejin?
1614962802,its taken 4 hours to dig this deep and far back
1614962816,Are you shitting us for giggles or are you deadly serious?
1614962834,think of their new network as the launch of skynet
1614962954,"they have games aimed at kids as young as 7, these add tiny bits of enj into a wallet, the range of games they have grows in age range right into the adult  world of crypto"
1614963002,i gotcha fam
1614963003,buying some
1614963012,hopefully the japanese don't attack me
1614963020,"each step in age range offers a greater range of rewards, only thing is these start to cost micro-transactions"
1614963040,https://tenor.com/view/smile-no-terminator-arnold-schwarzenegger-gif-4949713
1614963072,what is SUN doing
1614963107,"they have a user base of 20 million ppl, over the course of playing these games over the years all these ppl have secretly been hodling enj"
1614963123,thats what i came to yesterday or two days ago
1614963140,"but nvm, watching ETH approaching the liq price is not funny at all"
1614963173,They will have a nice profit by now 😀
1614963202,"every enj token invested into a project or fund, a percentage of their success and profit goes back into enj"
1614963225,and the enj token destroyed
1614963253,this lowers the circulation and raises the price
1614963348,"think about the ppl buying enjin in the games now, they are paying over the odds for a tiny piece of the pie which they have to hodl for years"
1614963365,genius idea
1614963382,What kind of pie?
1614963417,creampie
1614963420,:kekw:
1614963440,The correct answer was a Cinnamon Apple pie.
1614963449,freshly warmed up
1614963465,they get juicy scraps of enjin like 1% for 20% higher than its value if not a 100%
1614963467,with one singular scoop of ice cream
1614963500,i never understood icecream and pie
1614963610,neither here.. let a lot apple crumble..lol
1614963695,search twitter for Maxim Blagov
1614963792,"beacause microsoft, bmw, lab groups, atari and samsung oh and unity have been backed by enjin tokens."
1614963811,enjin make profit from every gain that they all make
1614964551,CHSB +14% 🥳🥳🥳
1614964771,Not too exciting for me since i came in at like 10% :kekw:
1614964796,But swissborg is quite exciting. Hope they expand the exchange aspect
1614965043,interesting development on BTC -> XMR atomic swaps reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ly62tk/let_there_be_swaps_public_xmrbtc_atomic_swap_demo/
1614965485,"enjin own the erc-1155 network, microsoft, bmw, atari, unity, lab groups all have projects backed on the enjin network
every coin created on the erc-1155 network makes them profit
every project backed in the above companies makes them profit
every erc-1155 transaction makes them profit(edited)
the binance launchpool was backed with enjin, every coin created on launchpool makes profit for enjin"
1614965550,Proof
1614965623,i will have to trawl through hours of investigation so bare with me
1614966171,Bare w/ u or bear? 😉
1614966195,we dont bring up bears around here
1614966201,thats how we lose money
1614966282,"they are with binance, swissborg, coinmarketcap, kyber, kryptomat, coin gecko and changelly"
1614966295,as partners
1614966326,all of them are backed by enjin coin
1614966353,🤫
1614966444,Did you basically say all in $ENJ?
1614966655,all backed using enjin coins
1614966677,thank me later
1614966911,that is why the rapid growth all the new coin releases
1614966925,I need to tell my 2 year a story in 5 mins. someone please give me an idea on what to make a story on.
1614966966,the poor kid who found great fortune and wisdom 😆
1614966982,Done. I'm actually going to do this now
1614966988,Ty
1614967301,Chickens 🙂 eggs. Spring. Easter bunnies 🐰
1614967410,"Hope u don't mind, but now my 2 year old knows about you.except he thinks ur a horse. Had to make it interesting to him. Neeiiigghhh"
1614967787,
1614967795,The horse that went to the moon
1614967880,"Wait, you can get free ENJ?"
1614967910,Yup. I'm making almost 40 enj a min rn
1614967918,How? 🙂
1614967951,40 ENJ a minute?
1614967967,That doesn’t sound good to put my real money in it then :p
1614968012,which app is that lol
1614968059,the one i sent earlier
1614968108,play the games and we all raise the price
1614968137,no its free to get little kids hooked onto crypto
1614968181,this is how they enacted the master plan all these coins get hodled for years
1614968183,i get Pi from my phone but ... it worth nothing bro
1614968559,Btc looking kinda healthy again
1614968792,"oh daamn, it actually recovered again!"
1614968808,"good stuff! next up 49k, lesgooo"
1614968888,BTC holders can finally go to sleep again
1614968903,i dont even hold btc and i will have troubles sleeping again
1614968908,lol
1614968909,Here is quick strategy ( quick-not big but good profits ) pick a coin watch the chart buy from support sell from resistance with of course a stoploss and repeat this 2-3 times in a day you make atleast %2-%10 but remember about STOP LOSS and dont be greedy for going more and more just take what you can and get out
1614968915,but that might be because my sleep schedule is fucked up since Dec
1614968929,Same
1614969010,"@Güneş might give that a shot actually, cheers man"
1614969083,Remember about STOPLOSS this is crucial and the coin you picked MUST have a good volume 🙂 dont go for low volumes at all
1614969089,Still didnt give proof
1614969102,And this works only in this weather like bumpy btc weathers
1614969113,makes sense yeah
1614969210,"I feel like whenever the resistence between 48.6k/49k is broken, btc will go up to 52k"
1614969237,better do it tonight then
1614969244,that bitch has been in the 40s for too damn long
1614969282,Yeah call me when that happens
1614969293,I’m getting old waiting
1614969301,relatable
1614969304,Fr me too
1614969315,but I don't mind being patient as long as I see progress towards that happening
1614969315,Fuckin ada go up and eth too
1614969323,today finally gave me (us) hope
1614969337,"@That one belgian super cunt read how projects backed by enjin coins work, what can't you see"
1614969340,Yeah i’d be happy if i see a steady rise
1614969365,I’m not saying I want a 20% rise in a day
1614969381,But seeing 3 days of steady growth would be nice
1614969386,indeed
1614969391,Exactly
1614969601,when is the next erc-1155 coin launch?
1614969630,I hevent.my real money is all in ada still. I have 400 enj from this app. It's hard puzzles though. Sure ur up for it?
1614969634,That will give you proof
1614969646,I just like having coins
1614969652,Idc if they go up or not
1614969654,They’re just nice
1614969666,And what can you do with the ENJ you earn ingame then?
1614969698,You can buy houses with it
1614969725,"nothing until you earn enough to withdraw, you link it up to a wallet and transfer it between games"
1614969796,as you earn more in game obviously that's millions  holding enjin coins for years
1614969846,Dude. Those are just exchanges and swap services that have a pairing. Doesnt mean they anything on ENJ. For god sake binance has its own smart contract chain. Why would one of the biggest exchanges use tech from some rando gaming coin.
1614969871,This is his proof
1614969901,it was also in the binance ama last night
1614969908,the french one
1614969930,coins are created using enj coins
1614969952,So you can earn 400 dollars playing a game
1614969977,Ok I should sell my ENJ then :p
1614969992,they have a competition starting in march to win 24btc
1614970011,you dont think thats gonna blow them sky high
1614970027,If you can earn 10 ENJ per minute no
1614970039,no one gives that away without making 10x that
1614970051,Could you stop with ENJ and just thanks me for CHSB !!!!! Thanks bye
1614970055,Sorry but could someone check all of the above?
1614970065,Except the CHSB part
1614970082,Your company didnt have my approval just because they didnt accept my good old fashionable driver licence!!!

1614970568,"So I'm just going to mention that Enjin randomly came up at work today, potential integration into their platform. Genuinely feels like everybody is talking about them"
1614970649,are the kucoin pumps good?
1614970739,"Dude, Enjin is going to be sooooo fucking big. Fuck making money from it. Im geniunely excited about where it goes. Will change the world"
1614970810,
1614970896,That's. Not. Diversified.
1614970916,Anyone on Bux Crypto here? What are you invested in out of the limited offer that they provide?
1614970917,Its like the only coin that i actually believe in.
1614970931,Uh-huh
1614970941,Everything else is wayyy too theoretical
1614970960,Will diversify after this goes up with 50%

1614971125,pls repeat
1614971239,They always claim like 1000% but turns out to be like 120% lol
1614971435,Btc just can’t go up
1614971460,At this point I wouldn’t be surprised if it drops again
1614971464,slap the shit out the mf and see how it goes up
1614971464,
1614971475,expect a drop again but with a higher low
1614971502,well it happened a few times before @Cryptoknight
1614971505,"i can't tell if I'm seeing double bottom, inverse head and shoulders or something completely different"
1614971508,so its a fairpoint :p

1614971907,I don’t get why you’re so positive about BTC going up easily after it hits 49k
1614971953,When we get to 50k it will get rejected
1614971964,"because we already reached current top few hours ago, it got refused, and it managed to recover back to that price again"
1614971990,and now it's holding around it again
1614972008,"if it gets rejected, I doubt we'll afford another recovery"
1614972013,it's now or not any time soon
1614972152,volume is decreasing

1614973027,its like 0.008 now lol
1614973039,BTC is not an Alt. Just because it crosses 50k doesnt mean it will shoot up. Theres still consolidation to happen.
1614973118,Isn’t DREP an absolute shitcoin
1614973122,I’m sure we’ve heard this before
1614973171,can't stand ADA

1614974112,I wonder how many dark web vendors sitting on a pile of BTC will atomic swap to XMR
1614974136,XMR?
1614974147,"Monero, it’s a privacy coin"
1614974171,It’s been going up the Monero.
1614974191,Imagine how much demand for Monero there will be once atomic swaps are launched
1614974208,The “criminals” will be able to anonymise their stash just by pressing a button
1614974276,heh
1614974285,like im not gonna get a bag of that lmao
1614974311,I honestly think XMR is a huge opportunity because of this
1614974323,And that’s coming from a Nano-shill
1614974333,Might have happened now
1614974570,It’s price alrady not cheap
1614974629,"You can't just look at price. ADA is $1.18 and its more ""expensive"" than Monero because of the amount of coins that have been distributed."
1614974674,Good point.  H hold any of Monerro?
1614974687,yeah I use it to buy drugs every week

1614979871,Not really. Still at a profit right nopw
1614979938,Havent looked at it for short term. For long term it is for you to decide. Crypto and gaming could have a future together.
1614979982,Is there anyway i can monitor the fee of etherium at the moment ? To make some swaps at uniswap

1614980568,When did you buy enj?
1614980587,First time at like 0.69 or something
1614980598,And did like 5 sells and entries in between
1614980608,She has served me well
1614980634,Gained around 0.04 btc from it I guess
1614980668,Sounds good. Depends on your budget tho
1614980681,0.2 btc in total :p
1614980710,0.04 on one coin is really good

1614981325,Why do you believe in it?
1614981457,I should ask why he did
1614981468,He does like months of research and then picks a coin
1614981481,Next one was xor on his list

1614986985,i heard some ppl speak good things of it but its a long coin... looks very slow for day trading i tried it a few times as  i only like doing day trading and i have coins that drop and rise in much better %'s
1614987221,"I see, well I don´t mind keep it long if the return is quite nice, and from what I read by myself about it, and also what others says, looks promising with a high probability of growth. Can be a 1$ coin in the future, which at the moment it´s just 0.06$. As I said, talking long term.
But I´ll read more about it. But for me (for now) looks a nice bag to have for the future 🤔"
1614988662,"@Jeremyfto so you would say, the best time to do futures, is times such as market correcting?"
1614989124,I will be honest I havent been in futures enough to say entirely its the best time but currently it has felt like a good time!
1614989173,Ahhh okay olay
1614989184,Ill try it out next market correction
1614990007,Do you guys think that the super volatility is over? It seems like things are correcting a lot slower which seems healthier to me then the harder spikes we had the last couple of corrections?
1614990027,"If you look at the graph curvature especially on ETH specifically, it seems a lot smoother"
1614991074,for sure
1614991433,what do you mean of super volatility

1614992586,wont touch this shit again
1614992600,Your ETH was hella late haha
1614992612,Hopefully it will just keep going up from here tho
1614992631,i closed the previous one when we got 1550
1614992636,fear of dropping the shit again
1614992657,
1614992667,Thats my only future right now
1614992710,my only hope is getting back again to the ATH and buying those long term coins im looking forward
1614992738,sort of 130-140 $ more
1614992741,which is doubling
1614992747,I have hope for the future!
1614992748,not really probable i think
1614992754,but who knows
1614993580,If ETH can get past 1650 I think we will be well on our way towards the predictions made of it going back to its ATH with 1430 being the mark I think would indicate a downward trend
1614993641,Right now the curvature looks like we are heading upwards but just got to wait and see if we can hit that mark
1614993770,This has been the hardest dip ETH has ever had
1614994011,well...
1614994024,"in how much time? like, said it few times"
1614994041,"2018 started at more than 1k, maybe 1.4k cant remember, but end up being 80"
1614994051,"could that be called a ""dip""?"
1614994083,I am looking at binance's chart which starts in early 2020
1614994110,Nov 26th 2019 was the first candle of binance having ETH
1614994150,"from then to now, this dip we just went through was the largest monetary dip in all the dips"
1614994169,as far as price of peak - price of floor
1614994203,I dont know what the hardest dip is percentage wise and that would take way too much analyzing for me
1614994231,"but if you scroll out on the 1 day chart and look at the line, this one goes down the furthest"
1614994308,I just realized that might be the starting date for ETH futures on binance
1614994443,"Ya I am dumb. Apparently thats just the futures chart, spot eth goes back all the way"
1614994651,"I reanalyzed and confimed, this is the hardest dip ETH has ever had between 2 1-week candles. 2042.34->1293.18. The only other dip that comes close to that is the 2018 dip that went from 1440->755 but that dip actually caused a downward trend which reduced ETH's price to ruble"
1614994779,"which is why its important that we dont drop below 1430 or risk pulling a 2018 again and instead we need to get it to 1650. One route leads to gold, one route leads to liquidation"
1614994894,i say biggest percentage dip
1614994902,13 march 2020 and 14 march 2020
1614994908,"which, obvious reasons, we all know why"
1614994919,(in binance)
1614994958,-56% in two days
1614995204,this in total was a 37% dip if going by percentages
1614995293,yup
1614995301,im trying to stick to percentages
1614995304,and log charts
1614996025,I wonder why swissborg is only on their platform. Sure its more secure or whatever but it kinda makes their price pretty easy to manipulate.
1614998121,"It's not, it's also on HitBTC, UniSwap and KuCoin:"

1615010942,my BFF just bought a tesla
1615010954,he gave up on ever owning a house so got a tesla instead.
1615010964,I want one so bad. Its my main purpose for trading right now
1615010981,and the gov is about to give me 1400 and the cherokees are about to give me 500
1615011014,so 7/30. My mom laughed at my 30k goal. Im gonna laugh back when I get my baby 😍
1615011039,I already have a name picked out; She shall be named Jessica and she shall be cherished
1615011056,"I like em but not that much, im waiting for the tech to be so widespread that its being refined and improved upon by more than just tesla and neo"
1615011073,"I had a car I was in love with though many years ago, she got stolen and my heart was broken"
1615011078,i spent 60k modding her
1615011083,down the drain.
1615011104,I was telling my friend I would let her try out the self driving and I said the same thing would happen to me if she wrecked it
1615011108,broken heart

1615012438,tesla pointless in australia tbh

1615013082,How much did you do then in yesterday's market?
1615013714,Drep
1615013723,Buy drep it will poooop
1615013726,@SeineJanie it’s a minus but wow celebrating 50$ behave man.
1615013728,High
1615013754,Dreppppp
1615013782,Who gives out these weak post grad statuses tbh lol
1615013823,Drep definitly will blow up
1615013824,Id celebrate + anything compared to a negative
1615013861,Go treat your wives to 50$ x
1615013882,crypto isnt a consistent win every day thing
1615013890,Yesterday I was -150
1615013896,Today I am +650
1615013923,Market is overall down ... imagine posting that u made 50 dollars lol
1615013938,ShAmeful
1615014047,Making 50$ is a W in my book mate and if you listened to some of their calls you would see they have been pretty accurate in most of their public call outs and they called the btc dip before it dipped super hard giving people in this server plenty of time to adjust their positons
1615014099,Just be glad we have post grads. They give tons of free analysis. Always DYOR but even being pointed in the right direction to good analysis is helpful
1615014112,Oh wow what a weak ass performance. Had you followed my call you would've been green.
1615014194,"Some days you make 700 bucks effortlessly letting everything run, some days you come out barely ahead while working the market hard.
So you'd rather I post big green numbers where it's just done by twiddling thumbs? Gotcha."
1615014223,trolls going to be trolling. Its a mini Kayne
1615014261,Yeah.
1615014292,BTw I did mean what I said! your BTC analysis saved me a bit of money! I appreciate your call outs 😄
1615014302,Appreciated!
1615014322,I could have done better for myself had I stuck to my original plan. 😂
1615014358,I understand that too well! Im always kicking myself for changing my plan midway through and not doing as well as I would have done
1615014385,"Key takeaway: ""Even"" Post Grads make mistakes every once in a while and don't time their trades perfectly."
1615014427,Well ya you guys are just traders too that make educated analysis. crypto isnt a 100% accuracy prediction world
1615014438,hell its not even a 70% accuracy prediction world most of the time
1615014449,You can do everything right and still get burned
1615014456,Exactly
1615014481,Its all about minimizing the damage and expanding the profits. Thats where traders seperate themselves
1615014481,embarassing.
1615014506,AB. Shut your mouth
1615014506,I know man! Your negative PNL was super embarrassing! thanks for admitting it though
1615014522,so is your fake status x
1615014547,My PNL is +55% right now buddy
1615014559,and its green unlike yours 😉
1615014577,"By the way, just erasing the daily PnL while leaving your 0.7 BTC overall balance makes it easy to deduce how much you lost. 😃"
1615014624,ok show @Jeremyfto
1615014653,
1615014655,EzClap
1615014686,i mean.. a post grad celebratrating 50 dollars       .........   any1 real 'graduates'
1615014712,That post grad did better than you so 🤷‍♂️
1615014726,And I will continue to do so. Any green day is a win in my book.
1615014729,nice he can  get half his groceries with it welll done.
1615014773,Wtf is wrong with a modest pnl during a unstable slightly bearish market. :kekw:
1615014778,if thats worth celebrating to you then well done bro lol
1615014808,Shhhh dont say the b word around here
1615014812,we dont want to scare the market
1615014813,"No, that was my total grocery amount yesterday. 😆
But I'm not dependent on trading gains for daily expenses...
That $50 will be made into 500 and 5000 soon."
1615014829,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1615014837,understanding how easy post grad is handed out here
1615014859,"Guess its true. You get rid of one kayne, and another takes it's place"
1615014868,Just fuck off. If your intent is to just insult post grads while being a PNL loser just leave. Go watch cryptoking or whatever so you can be shilled doge
1615014898,I am up like 120 bucks i think.
1615014907,how much money did AB lose? bro is mad salty for no reason
1615014910,give it a rest belgian dont get stressed because a 50 dollar flex doesnt impress us x
1615014921,"Yes, yes. Post Grad status should totally be handed out based on how many actual dollars you can make off of a 0.73 BTC balance. Rrrriiiiight 😂"
1615014924,its already explained it wasnt a 50 dollar flex
1615014929,lol
1615014934,Im up 600$ and I'm afraid to go to sleep cause I dont want to wake up to negative 😂
1615014938,u dumb or u trolling bro

1615015434,I think compared to BTC I made +13% or so over the last 24 hrs
1615015476,ETH almost to 1600
1615015487,Chinese are doing work
1615015519,bnb is no match
1615015572,"yo if u had like $300 on futures for example, and it goes way down, u get liquidated rather than go into debt and they start taking money from your balance right @Jeremyfto"
1615015596,Made another +15% in fiat on CHSB
1615015604,"Only on cross margin. On isolated margin, you choose how much you put in when it goes down"
1615015616,You cant go into debt at all
1615015637,like right now my current isolated margin is holding 400$. Its basically like 400$ of insurance
1615015646,"yea thats what im saying. like if i put 300 on a futures trade, max i can lose is that 300"
1615015651,they dont touch my other balance
1615015655,That is correct
1615015655,as collateral or smth
1615015667,yea im not trying to get my binance acc wiped
1615015668,so i was wondering
1615015687,If you do isolated margin it will only touch what you put in
1615015705,if you do cross margin it will use your entire FUTURE wallet. It will never touch your fiat wallet
1615015722,they are seperate wallets and you will need to transfer to your future wallet to use it on futures
1615015732,u doing isolated right
1615015735,Yes
1615015741,Isolated you have much more control
1615015752,"yea i notice, seems way better"
1615015755,u never tried cross margin?
1615015766,Iv tried cross margin. I started on cross margin
1615015771,Isolated is way better
1615015820,ah yea so i take it that u will stick with isolated
1615015838,Yes. basically every futures trader I have talk to does the same thing
1615015842,i think cross is useless
1615015849,Cross is a handicap
1615015855,you cant really have full control of your risk
1615015856,IMO
1615015856,for those who dont know how to manage margin
1615015867,which is my main target here
1615015887,Yep. Thats why I always recommend isolated. You have much more control over your position
1615015908,Cross is good for single position futures trading with higher leverage
1615015933,"But if you want to hold more positions over more than a few minutes or hours, isolated is definitely the better option."
1615016039,Looks like ETH is going to take a break on the 1600 push so im going to sleep. Night everyone
1615016072,"Night, Jeremy! Sleep well and may your portfolio value appreciate while you do. 😉"
1615016083,"gn mate, hopefully 1.6k soon"
1615016101,yo anyone here on ETH futures? how much adl you got
1615016106,"Thanks! If its red when I wake up, I'm gonna start day drinking. If its green I may go to the movies"
1615016203,"true HODLers know that green is the guaranteed endgame, no matter what happens"
1615016290,i made $60 today
1615016298,can i have post grad too
1615016757,"I'm reaching my goals, one of which is consistently outperforming Bitcoin. Another is, green day streak."
1615016828,i wish i could have a PNL analysis on overall wallet
1615016854,"Yeah, that would be great!"
1615017067,"Dude, this is really sad. Laugh-reacting to your own message."
1615017093,:kekw:
1615017129,its like when you are high

1615026749,Ah you're saint then
1615026836,"waiting to see if 48k holds, if it doesn't, I'll short btc"
1615026838,:kekw: if this XSL goes 3 cent il be happy already
1615026847,the right shoulder will start completing at that point
1615026855,I dont have twittter at all.. and all good in my hood. no one following me. no creeps or stalkers lol
1615026877,i have a 3d printing related one so spamming a referral code...is gonna end up bad for my following
1615026940,Lmao
1615026985,i got 586 followers so close to 600 so i dont want to risk it
1615027070,"We're only moving back a bit in the Bollinger bands, should be good unless it goes way south of 48k. So, good strat you got there."
1615027276,"What does this mean, Ive never experienced and alt season, so idk what the market tendency’s are then?"
1615027400,"It means there will be a point where all of these low market cap coins (aka ""shitcoins"") tank and their time will be over for good. Lost to the annals of crypto like NMC, FRC and all the coins that came before them.
Take profits while they're good but get out soon enough cause they won't ever recover if their time is up. So all the new hype coins you're probably not gonna hear from them again 2 years down the road.
But altseason hasn't really started yet, so no need to panic now."

1615027610,i got in around 2016-2017
1615027620,"Okay, that may be why 😏"
1615027649,got my assets stolen in january of 2018 so didn't look at crypto up until like a month or two ago
1615027669,"But exchange those with REEF, COTI or MDA and look at it from 2023. Not saying all of these will go to shit, but most."
1615027687,I remember...

1615027718,Fuckin robbers 🤬
1615027737,i wish there was a report system where you could report stolen BTC so it gets tracked when it hits a exchange
1615027764,a friend from an altcoin dev team flagged my coins
1615027765,fuck me.  I can imagine the pain

1615027901,nearly killed myself
1615027918,😂😂💀
1615027922,oh january 2019
1615027928,i thought iwas 2019
1615027948,"oh right the big crash happened and I was like ""imma HODL"" and I was about to buy a fucking ledger to safe secure"
1615027954,understandable. but u will make more money and BTC. life goes on. 🙂
1615027974,But the thing about life
1615027989,"Is sometimes, not losing shit is the issue"
1615027993,But how u lost it
1615027998,The how can hurt more
1615028065,broke 48k
1615028068,"@SeineJanie so ur saying, even coins that u do believe in, its best to convert them into stablecoins? Cause even those go to shit, during “saltseason”"
1615028090,waiting for a recovery maybe?
1615028126,how long does this transfer of LTC take? still processing
1615028146,Crash?!? 👀😂😂
1615028192,"doubt there will be a crash, but it's currently bound to go down a bit"
1615028219,bulls and bears fighting atm
1615028226,feel like it's still too risky to enter idk
1615028251,"Top 5 coins you can hodl. BTC, ETH, ADA... Most likely safe bets.
But don't keep ENJ just because you believe in it (unless it *does* become a top 10 or top 5 coin 😉)."
1615028256,Mine’s done already
1615028260,Minutes
1615028268,LTC is quick as balls
1615028278,"Damn okay, that sucks"
1615028291,Ill have to drop my VET and XLM
1615028325,"In your opinion what other two would be top 5? I currently HODL ADA, NANO, and VET"
1615028351,bulls recovering 48k ugh I hate this shit
1615028351,I sold@my 500 xlm and got some@ltc. And that went to fund my 0.003 XYl coin 🙂
1615028353,"DOT, ~~NANO~~ (you already said it)?"
1615028358,aight gonna hold out more
1615028374,Hmmm
1615028391,@SeineJanie Do I have to verify identity...?
1615028412,yes
1615028415,KYC is needed
1615028419,RSR is promising as well right?
1615028421,Not yet! 😆
1615028445,mmm since GTO is having sudden spikes in buying
1615028453,Yeah I know
1615028454,wonder If I should up my sell limit incase its a poomp
1615028457,When it happens
1615028465,still holding a GTO bag
1615028523,"BNB, DOT, XRP too right now. Nano isn't there yet, but promising.
We'll have to wait for altseason to come to a close. ☺️"
1615028560,im surprised so many of post grad still believes XRP can break up
1615028578,"Whats the point of hodling coins from a project u like, if the after effects of altseason, just kill everything 😭"
1615028585,depends on the coin
1615028593,if its a strong development team they don't die
1615028606,I hope 🤞🏿
1615028612,shit like LTC and monero is still alive
1615028622,now if its a team that just throws in the towel
1615028625,yeah RIP
1615028686,ada isnt going to die when bear season happens. that dev team is too strong
1615028702,value might tank but they will still be there most likely when bulls come back
1615028727,"jesus there's actual support at 48k, amazing"
1615028841,"Vet sometimes acts on its own, away from btc sentiment"
1615028851,Like rn its still holding really well
1615028904,i got a small bag of vet
1615028916,2164
1615028917,I have about 1300 VET
1615028930,Nothing crazy but enough to take off if it does
1615028965,oh boy unfi doing well
1615028969,got 21 of that
1615028977,700 bucks. I think I bought in at like 200 bucks
1615029225,got a call from trade survivors on that thing a while ago and I bought some
1615029235,gr8 call
1615029390,is there any way to convert less than 10 gbp to btc or any other coin
1615029464,Convert small assets to BNB?
1615029494,just less than 10gbp thats stuck as fiat still
1615029531,Oh idk probably a sign you should put more fiat in then lmao
1615029561,oh that worked its bnb now
1615029634,Bnb good to have on hand for fees
1615029653,Yes it converts even 10p
1615029840,When will SYL list on binance?
1615029904,As soon as they release it.
1615029918,This year 🙂 we need to wait. Hence the price.
1615029936,But it’s good that there will@be option to move it to binance to trade
1615030350,Reee
1615030385,🤔
1615030436,Damn btc. I want my points damnit
1615030461,What points? I need some lol
1615030490,Its just the swissborg community app. I dont think it gives actual money. @felguerr
1615030511,I see
1615030527,Anyhow I have swissborg tokens and happy as it’s green. 💵🤠
1615032357,and we're going down
1615032366,this is pretty secure at this point
1615032406,"if you're interested in shorting btc, now's the time"
1615032412,can't say where it's gonna go yet
1615032418,but I expect it to hang around 47k for now
1615032872,"prices where it may bounce:
47.5k
46k
42k-43k (if we reach this low, just close the short and long the fuck out of it, it may be an insane bounce from here)"
1615032939,"there's also the 41k that many people suggest it will reach, but I think 42k-43k support line will be too strong, anything is possible, which is why you should prepare for any outcome"
1615032978,My BLZ just got stopped 😦
1615032983,Profit but small 😦
1615033090,Where do you guys think it will bounce from ?
1615033107,I would love to see ( do not offended please ) a quick touchdown on 39k
1615033139,na
1615033150,"41k the lowest possibility, 42k-43k being more realistic"
1615033161,don't expect 39k
1615033167,But remember what i said earlier yesterday
1615033172,Including 5x leverage
1615033183,Will liquidated if btc touchs down to 39.800
1615033197,They might wanna kill them first before the raise
1615033203,5x and highers*
1615033209,do you think that factors the price action so much?
1615033214,"I mean it may, but to what degree"
1615033218,I don't know man
1615033229,"anything below 40k is a reach, we gotta be honest"
1615033230,As far as i know right now there is huge players in leverage
1615033236,with almost 1m$ each contracts
1615033239,Last time it dipped
1615033241,they all liquidated
1615033253,"I get that, but I think bigger players use more than 5x lol"
1615033271,5x is not that much for someone with tons of cash who can afford to lose a lot
1615033280,yes thats what im saying 5x and over 5x is liquidated whatever they do on 38.800
1615033295,but lets see
1615033529,I'm not selling my BTCUP *just yet*...
1615033553,"RSI is really down on the 15m and close to oversold on the 1h, I expect a bounceback, even if only slightly"
1615033597,next half hour is going to be very interesting
1615033612,"I didn’t hit my sales order on ENJ this night, so close"
1615033619,Hurts so much now :p
1615033655,Oh well Lets wait until btc is settled I guess and take a decision then
1615033708,yes
1615033796,There is a fight going on at 47.6
1615033807,And it will end bloody as f
1615033939,Are there any pumpgroup owners here wants an admin server with more admins to pump together for more volume for our members?
1615034000,”for our members” you mean for your prepumps lol
1615034023,Give the plebs our profit!
1615034435,And that milf in avatar to tease the poor boys with high testosterone XD
1615034780,Lol
1615035041,Fuck you bitcoiiiin you shit coin:virgin:
1615036643,Ok we lost 47.6 i guess
1615036708,🥲
1615036829,"As soon as I open my long you become somebody else big market sells im watching my stops , the price just drops I thought you were cool you looked like a bull to meee tell me why'd you have to go and make me get liquidated??"
1615036847,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvZ7K_0_SiY
1615036849,song version ❤️
1615037680,i think this one is his link (sorry for pinging swiss)
1615037964,How low u guys think this market crash gonna go to?
1615038070,Nobody knows i think
1615038100,Back again to 43? Down to 37? 32?
1615038139,I might get the hell out my futures if it starts bearing and migjt rethink the whole strat
1615038169,"Maybe go short, maybe wait till dip, load up some big bags and come back when i finish uni"
1615038224,
1615038237,Maybe my insomnia myself saw the future
1615038254,I see that weekends generally is very bad for crypto :(.....??
1615038266,Wdym by short??
1615038280,I’m very new to all this
1615038316,Ouff
1615038324,"Short, simple definition"
1615038352,"Is you ""borrow"" someone else's coin, sell them at a high point, repay and buy the same amount lower"
1615038387,"And you can even operate with more money than you have, leveraged, those 3x, 5x, 10x you see at binance for example"
1615038398,"So profits are bigger, but losses too"
1615038432,"There much more in it than this simple explanation, so you must study a lil bit"
1615038445,Binance academy helps a lot
1615038452,Oh rightt
1615038468,Yeah you can find some of this stuff in #🔤crypto-101
1615038488,I kinda get it now :))
1615038520,oh sure also in the 101 channels
1615038562,There’s nooo wayyy btc going to 32k!!
1615038589,https://tenor.com/view/pedro-monkey-puppet-meme-awkward-gif-15268759
1615038616,Please no....
1615038646,you need patience and steel hands boy
1615038660,"and know where to enter, and when to exit"
1615038678,I’m working on it 🙂
1615038704,there are some good free technical analysis playlist out there
1615039247,lol people said no way BTC could go below 10K in 2018
1615039254,we went to like what 2k?
1615039351,In 2018?? 😮
1615039390,heh
1615039399,ETH lost 94% through the whole year
1615040682,you can tell when people are new to this
1615041033,"But it will go up to 100,000. Wanna know why I think? Just dude trust me"
1615041037,🗿
1615041218,"Very different imo, no one wanted BTC in 2018, now everyone wants some so if it dips people are going to buy"
1615041296,i cant wait for BTC to no longer be *the* coin
1615041298,"Dont get me wrong tho, im sure btc will dip after the bull run, but nothing like 2018"
1615041336,lol everybody wanted BTC in 2017-2018
1615041340,the rush was hard
1615041345,it was aLL over the news
1615041351,people talked to me asking how to get bitcoin
1615041394,some guy longing it to be 200k
1615041405,hype that the wall street bonus would pump it
1615041409,and then the dump
1615041414,good old times 😂
1615041415,"During the bull run yeah, after that it was like the thing to avoid at all cost"
1615041503,"btc is that coin where like, the more i read about it the less i like it"
1615041586,its more symbolic I guess
1615041612,"complete opposite to nano, where the more i read about it, the more i like it"
1615042116,bitcoin is an absolute shitcoin
1615042132,"its slow, its stupid power hungry. its super manipulated by big corps"
1615042142,and expensive
1615042236,Why bps stop pumping?
1615042324,because mcafee is in jail
1615042327,:godsgardener:
1615042611,No shit XD
1615042634,Propably getting anal love. That's karma bitch
1615042838,I sold my ADA today to rescue a enj future I opened way too high 😬
1615042879,"I knew enj was going to dip, but I wasn't aware how much it would dip. Hopefully it's finished dipping soon."
1615043293,lol imagine falling for that enj shill :kekw:
1615043842,I have to say CHSB holding well!  Touch wood lol something to keep me going and hoping. As all the rest in hell fire lol at the moment.
1615043880,yo if bps stops pumping

1615044645,@Blackhartd is there a minimum amount of SYL that u can buy or u can even buy just 1$ worth?
1615044698,technically yes
1615044704,i dont think there is a minimum
1615044715,but you need to go APE on ICOs for MAXIMUM 4th wave profits
1615045141,bruhhh
1615045146,the minimum is 100$
1615045148,lmfao
1615045160,"woooow, who do these guys think I am 😭"
1615045178,"I mean if the market wasnt so shit rn, I wouldve had that extra 100$ by now"
1615045224,How long untill xsl goes to phase 4?
1615045364,no idea
1615045380,"i think its more of ""when X amount is sold move to next phase of the ICO token sale"""
1615045467,100$
1615045518,And what u think price then? 0.004? 🙂
1615045533,look at the website? i havent looked yet
1615045610,I hope by the end of the week they havent moved to phase 4 🤣 🤣

1615049085,We die :kekw:
1615049104,"Telluric Token is a Hard Fork of CanadianToken (CADT) on the MintMe (Webchain), (TELT) currently has a average price of $0.20 and a market cap of $2.06m USD, all existing CADT is transferrable via our Bridge to (TELT) on the Binance Smart Chain from the Webchain!

Telluric Token is now available on PancakeSwap, that allows to trade it for any token on the Binance Smart Chain, the entrance point of Telluric Token on the BSC is $0.20!

PancakeSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based Decentralized Exchange launched by anonymous devs with a penchant for breakfast foods and rabbits.

It looks a bit like Ethereum’s SushiSwap (community governance, the ability to farm liquidity provider tokens) and Uniswap, but also incorporates many other features that let you earn rewards."
1615049117,Nice copy paste
1615049132,"I wrote it myself, no sense writing it over and over again."
1615049186,"We are a new project with a deep outlook and vision, I'm just spreading the word before our news articles release on Monday!"
1615049211,"Telluric Token Outlook - As Centralization and Regulation make a squeeze on the DeFi ecosystem our team believes in the core values of an anonymous, decentralized financial system. We are developing constantly to bring chains together and allow adopters to move their tokens and assets freely around different networks. It is our belief that in doing so we will be able to help the DeFi world escape the grasp of centralization and regulation! Our deepest core value is that you should never be anything but a hash!"
1615049238,More information on the project is available! You can just ask!
1615049241,Cool📉
1615049252,TLDR
1615049305,i looked at previous years
1615049353,"and man idk, we might need a constant flow of buyers throughout the whole year IMO to prevent getting from a dip below 40k"
1615049355,but i dont know shit
1615049362,"TLDR; We are a new cutting edge privacy coin, more than a token we are a vision. We are developing our own completely decentralized, self-sufficient, blockchain, our own completely decentralized NON-KYC Exchange, starting on the Webchain, with a Hard Fork already onto the Binance Smart Chain. We are the next major step to bring decentralization back to DeFi."
1615049363,and i still have to finish xelo's trading course
1615049397,
1615049405,Am I being optimistic or delusional as far as ENJ is concerned? 🤔
1615049434,okay mate sounds great... if ur wallet isnt holding atleast 2000$ worth of doge
1615049438,then we dont wanna hear it
1615049443,it just means ur not serious
1615049505,"people shilling ""projects"" in channels nowadays?"
1615049515,righttt
1615049525,there should be a 1.rule
1615049537,we got already a rule about it
1615049540,no firm can shill their damn coin unless theyre holding atelast 2000$ doge
1615049550,then we know theyre serious
1615049568,You mean so we know they’re clowns x
1615049582,u calling tesla a clown?!??!!?!
1615049611,"get an asset portfolio over billions, then tell me who the clown really is"
1615049626,https://tenor.com/view/dogecoin-notkdk3-stonks-crypto-doge-gif-20148669
1615049719,Elon just likes to see the market dance to his tune
1615049742,dont use fancy buzzwords and just explain in simple terms what makes you different than 10000 other DeFi apps out there?
1615049789,"i think market is already oversaturated with DeFi apps. Half of them being scams, and remaining are rarely legit or just doesnt bring anything new to the table."
1615049917,just ban him
1615049918,"We are a project that believes, you shouldn't ever have to be more than your hash

We are a currency, and are developing a blockchain with privacy, and anonymity in mind

We are building an exchange with no KYC verification you sign up and interact as your wallet hash"
1615049927,bros firm doesnt even have 2000$ worth of doge
1615049963,I need to go ahead and buy some SYL before they sell out
1615049983,50k club yeah
1615049983,u can buy these 🥜
1615050022,Only needs a $10bn market cap. Sol is at $4.something already
1615050024,were u ever able to sell ACM?
1615050126,it would be
1615050145,100 000 * 1$
1615050166,🤣
1615050167,yes
1615050171,but imagine that in ur balance
1615050185,it would be crazy
1615050193,personally
1615050197,i will let it rot
1615050202,"Our average adopter who sold everything when we released on Pancakeswap, now has around $5,000 USD in whatever currency they wanted to sell it for"
1615050203,and check it out when my first son is born
1615050211,SYL buyers did you buy with Litecoin or Btc
1615050235,"To shill ur coin here, ur firm has to have atleast 2k $ worth of doge"
1615050238,sorry man
1615050241,I dont make the rules
1615050245,sounds great and all
1615050262,yeah cause ur at the position to do so
1615050262,"btw enought with the shilling, what do you think about ETH?"
1615050280,could we be saying that a correction might have already happened? or just we keep the eye on BTC hip moves
1615050296,what do you mean
1615050344,Id need atleast 1k$ to be able to invest back in some other coins
1615050355,"im not in the position, to just invest and leave"
1615050356,clearer version here
1615050365,I got no excess at the moment
1615050370,oh
1615050375,thats tuff
1615050379,yeah ahahah
1615050403,I am sticking to my initial prediction of 1650 being our breakout point towards a strong upward trend
1615050414,we have made good movement but we arent there yet
1615050448,"but with that being said, I aint going anywhere till that price tag says 2k"
1615050586,BTC to ~65k-70k than a massive dump to ~30k
1615050605,Massive corporate shorting during the dip and than up to ~95k by the end of the year
1615050703,i'd say around that too
1615050720,but man im not gonna make any move till we touch the door at the 1700 mf
1615050756,I don't think a 70k->30k dump is realistic mate. It could happen but its not a likely outcome without purposeful manipulation. You have to go off the normal movements because none of us can predict manipulation accurately
1615050826,"I am not touching my hold till 2k. At 2k I might sell out, I might sell 80%. I havent decided yet"
1615050849,likely I will sell out though. Thats going to be a little over 500% for me
1615050886,"and honestly, I could really use that ~5k in my tesla fund"
1615050909,huh
1615050926,Sorry but no one is getting fucked in the tesla
1615050933,😭
1615050933,she is staying crisp and clean
1615050938,u werent supposed to see that
1615050956,Im naming her Jessica and she shall be my baby ❤️
1615050978,Im hoping u get her soon brother
1615050995,Ill start saving up in 5 years for my lexus LX
1615051000,"Interestingly Casper has the same total token count as SYL (10bn), so to get to $1 will also take a market cap of $10bn, but the cheapest token price at ICO is 5x the price of SYL, so returns are potentially much less"
1615051009,My goal is 30k by december. With ETH win + gov money + cherokee money Ill be at 7k/30k
1615051033,u love to see it
1615051041,"oh damn, yeah i love the grande cherokee"
1615051071,Oh I am talking about the actual cherokees. I am cherokee enough to have a card so they are sending me covid relief
1615051081,Im very white though lol
1615051083,ohh lol
1615051088,😂
1615051109,My plan is to make some bigger spot plays when I hit 7k
1615051142,And I might take advantage of Swifter's strat and put some into sky and just wait for it to be pumped
1615051154,"since he was right, it does get pumped every 3 days"
1615051155,ive always thought about that
1615051170,Got my fingers crossed for u
1615051170,"legit look at the senior alerts, there is always sky pumps"
1615051288,my whole plan depends on how ETH performs before 31th march
1615051305,"i have to get SYL, andwould like a lil bag of CHSB"
1615051332,"and if IOHK signs the deal with good outcome for ADA, lets dream, with a new ATH, or getting close again"
1615051337,swissborg aint available for me... will a vpn work 🤣
1615051349,might even sell part of my ADA in case of i need a bit more money to buy it
1615051887,covid-19 bill passed
1615051897,crypto market immediately reacted
1615051928,what bill O_o
1615051938,stimmy??
1615052004,i think stimulus is inevitable
1615052039,some good fucking news
1615052047,you just cheered tf me up
1615052052,"yep, $1400/american"
1615052069,damn
1615052084,we got only tax increases in spain
1615052104,one of the few mf in europe doing that
1615052143,Atleast you have good weather
1615052167,We have high taxes and shitty weather
1615052198,heh
1615052199,well
1615052206,i live in northwestern spain
1615052212,i got the best weather of the f world
1615052219,anyone else staking ATOM?
1615052228,one friend of mine doing it iirc
1615052229,it follows BTC/ETH trends closely 🙏🏻 with high stake rates
1615052248,hovers around 10%
1615052259,im using Exodus wallet for it
1615053538,LTC
1615053799,how are the fees?
1615054000,LTC? very low.
1615054167,0.15 or so?
1615054209,"i got a problem with those things, when sending out money to platforms like this one, we should use the normal coin network right? like, using binance smart chain wouldnt make it arrive?"
1615054229,and i've tried to read about it but cant make it clearer
1615054366,I lived in Vigo last year
1615054374,Where do u live in Spain?
1615054388,I’m coming back in September btw
1615054733,not gonna tell sorry
1615054754,but its in galicia
1615054775,I love Spain:) Food. prices lol people.
1615054794,what do you guys expect from the fire pump signal/ the great pump colab tonight? did they have good results in the past runs?
1615054799,Que bien:)
1615054820,"Its a scam, don’t do it except if you have a bot"
1615054897,People are saying the US stimulus bill is the stimulus for Bitcoin et al going up now.
1615054919,anyone come up with any strategy to profit off the alerts here?
1615054933,noted. pre-pumped much?
1615054941,Always :p
1615054950,And the fair pumps suck ass
1615054957,Because there is no volume
1615054975,And even then you are just gambling to get other people their money who are slower
1615054980,"I actually did already on a few occasions. You look for sustained growth after the alert, if it's not in fact a pump and dump. Some will keep going for a while."
1615055003,Btc back down ?!?
1615055007,Like if you see sky popping off
1615055008,👀
1615055014,You can try to catch the wave
1615055016,sick pump bro
1615055072,got it. less then 5% could be possible then? but is it worth the risk eh
1615055098,But you have better chanche getting into an organic pump then
1615055167,"hmm, whats a organic pump?"
1615055185,Like watch the sky graph
1615055228,As an example
1615055288,But don’t buy into now please :p
1615055316,was thinking the same thing haha. good call tho
1615055372,elaborate briefly please?
1615055583,again like SKY / ENJ
1615055590,things that are suddenly hyped
1615055601,like e.g. an announced partnership
1615055609,"they will take off, there will be an alert"
1615055618,but they will keep the momentum and grow further
1615055722,evx going up
1615055763,Still nothing from BPS lul
1615055830,or syscoin 🙂
1615055898,afk lol
1615056089,They got arrested sadly
1615056101,"So what I do is if I'm up for it, I look at an alerted asset and watch it for a minute or two to see where it's going. If I have the feeling that this is a longer surge and not a pump and dump, I go in and try to ride it as long as I can.
Usually watching the position very closely. Sometimes it will pump enough to put a stop loss in and then go do other things."
1615057317,One of the imminent enemies of the ccp is the declining birth rate
1615057359,Lower than replacement rate few children means fewer producers of wealth in the future
1615058341,"Not only that, their one child rule, has basically created a population dominantly men. The male to female ratio is crazy."
1615058498,yeah there's millions more males than females. So for many dudes it's literally impossible to get a gf lol
1615059011,yeah well they better grow some poly amorous gf or som shit like that if they wanna get coochie
1615059069,Llueve demasiado pero el paisaje es precioso
1615059078,Falo galego si queres 😂
1615059369,Ole 🥳
1615059396,Where are you from?
1615060009,The solution ccp style would be automation and state human farms.
1615060027,Invitro citizens
1615060038,Im based in UK but mixed back ground. Also like languages 🙂
1615060046,"I have a friend who lived and worked in China. They pay no attention to the one child rule, they just register the birth of one child, usually boys. So the figures you see don't reflect the actual population"
1615060122,"That’s interesting. Thanks for that, I did not know."
1615060304,"does BPS canceld? Nothing on the servers, no announcments"
1615060335,why you gotta do him like that lmao
1615060370,all recent cancellations have followed radio silence so I am not hopeful
1615060378,we have a joke theory that he is this MacAffee lawd that got invicted
1615060390,John MacAffee isnt he?
1615060445,"lmao its john mcaffee ewbanks, part time crypto king, cyber security and boxer"
1615060456,"I miss the ""we cancelled it because of market volatility"" excuse"
1615060467,"nah, i LOVE DISCORD IS BUGGY"
1615060470,"""We didnt think this pump was good for our members"""
1615060475,or how ever they write that shit down
1615060486,John McAffee is what you receive when you order Elon Musk from wish
1615060492,"yeah i know about him, thats only i haven't been following his case"
1615060496,I am deceased
1615060499,he was arrested in barcelona i think 😂
1615060507,John McAffee is what you get when you buy how to scam method
1615060573,"what are the chances that BPS is done for ever, or in complete silence so peeps forget about them, and they have enough funds to make rapid orders and pump a coin ALONE so they start looking good in some peeps?"
1615060584,it is all his big scam to get you to buy his pc protection
1615060589,you are cornered
1615060599,"so they can recover from all the scams, get attention AGAIN"
1615060609,you guys are using anti viruses?
1615060625,I've had the covid vaccine I'm good right?
1615060670,"idk, you might be.. or you got chipped by Microsoft"
1615060690,Kaspersky Total since 2015 i think
1615060699,I have noticed complex quantum mechanics problems seem real easy to solve recently
1615060741,And your wallets empty.
1615060872,stonks
1615060876,Seems like everyone got canceled today
1615061175,wasn't much in there we're good 😆
1615061472,So you got the Sputnik vaccine? 😆
1615061872,what
1615061880,we waiting for the english one
1615061889,i dont trust russian and chinese ones
1615061905,some reports of lower efficiency on brazil
1615061914,any coins with a solid momentum atm ?
1615061934,but #💰crypto-only-chat
1615062389,I know few people who did. And all good really no problem
1615062393,https://go-away.nothing-to-see-he.re/RqH1IF
1615062397,heh
1615062459,That's because the real vaccines were sold on the black market and the Brasilian patients only got a salt water injection. Hence the low efficiency
1615062488,If John McAffee was a country 🇧🇷
1615062493,If I were to get one. Would be Russia or British. And by the way. Since last December Oxford and Russians worked together to improve and make British vaccine more efficient as they based on same “technology”
1615062543,💯
1615062552,That's not the real BPS group
1615062585,"Murats pretends he runs the big PnD's, but all he's doing is trying to get people to buy VIP's"
1615062600,Murats is a bitch
1615062610,"If you look at the times he posts the coin, he's always 15 seconds later than the real groups"
1615062614,we talking about Big Pump Signal
1615062626,that's like Adadas and Adidas
1615062724,"In the Chinese sphere, even the cheapest stuff gets faked.You can get clothes from H&W there"
1615062736,But we're kind of striding off topic
1615062757,BPS is dead
1615062799,We lowered the price of our vip membership! Send a message now. Hurry up!
1615062842,`1 HOUR LEFT! We are accepting 1 last VIP member! Contact @BPS mοderatοr immediately if you're interested.` :kekw:
1615062871,Imagine falling for that
1615062907,"well, just a day or 2 ago there was a guy here who needed help withdrawing BTC he won in a fake giveaway"
1615062938,"If I hadn't been brought up properly, I would already be rich from having scammed the shit out of people, but alas"
1615062952,YO ETH OR ENJ???
1615062963,Like everyday you see the twitter whale_alert going off because some poor soul sent >1 BTC to a known scam address
1615062981,"ENJ, buy my bag"
1615063179,Dazz left the server btw?
1615063197,really?
1615063204,Cant find him
1615063218,He is around
1615063224,"woah, what?"
1615063226,ye man left
1615063232,their original telegram?
1615063242,let's crack open a cold one in his name
1615063267,may god have it in his glory
1615063267,he was prolly here to just promote the enj pump 😄
1615063269,The Murats group is a fake version of BPS
1615063274,Who will talk about enj now🥲?
1615063354,God it’s peaceful now without all his ENJ
1615063363,Got my syl as well 🥙
1615063367,i like how it has 250k compared to 150k
1615063425,"Now let's w8 for some casper, I think I'm going to split 50/50 0.015 and 0.03, about 130 bucks each"
1615063462,"Could also be fake members, active members is lower than the real BPS"
1615063566,BPS today?>
1615064012,BPS's discord seems dead
1615064015,like no admins or anything
1615064118,Dlt seems interesting for BPS imo. Let them fuck up by pushing it now 😂😂 due to its market cap it should be easy to pump🙈

1615066080,#freemoney

1615066144,Ill be liquidated before I sell for less than 2k ETH
1615066163,don't ask for it 👀
1615066173,"Btc: down 
Bnb: down

1615066178,I like that

1615066726,and as soon as i got 2k
1615066732,i make a 2x till july
1615066738,next update bustin 3k or die
1615066998,YA! go for big or go home lol.
1615067019,maybe I should get some ETH when deeps. I yet to own even a 0.00001  of it lol
1615067036,Btc dropping to 46k?
1615067149,you just scared me dude
1615067183,yo guys how long till i know if my ADA pool got rewarded at Daedalus?
1615067232,ENJ appears to be on the way back up 👀  Let's see if it holds the trend like I hodl that future
1615067461,i got nothing lol. but I've read it takes sometimes 2 weeks for the pay out at least first time.. and then it goes faster. did u get anything?:)
1615067518,Also just looked. Ada is 90% decentralized. Really wandering what would be with price when it comes to 100%
1615067826,will never happen
1615067891,why? 90% is kind of close to 100 🙂 or even 95-99
1615067920,complete decentralization sounds unreal
1615067965,still 90% is somethig I believe.
1615067981,yeah sure
1615067990,helps to keep ADa on float I believe. despite all this shake out. Stakers dont pull out dont panic sale..
1615070247,Pretty sure it took 20 days (4 epochs) for my first rewards. I’ve had about 6 epochs of rewards. Got 6.4 ADA this time
1615070660,for first delegation it takes up to 3 epochs i think
1615070665,patince is rewarding:) i'll be waiting. I got Ada to stake anyways and leave it for loong time. not to buy and sale with 10% up 🙂
1615070668,afterwards its every epoch
1615070736,"oh one thing, that is considered you delegate to a pool that is good saturated. Pools with really low saturation might not get assigned to a slot every epoch"
1615070749,but they are compensated for the epochs they missed
1615070787,They try to make sure the percentages even out over time.
1615070787,so the end of the year 5% doesnt change. Doesnt matter you whether got a slot in every epoch or in half of them
1615070827,"Like this epoch my pool got 4.4%, one before was 7.6%"
1615070847,So then we get a couple of lower ones before a big one or two
1615070858,yeah similar for my pool. I didnt get anything since last epoch and this one. So in next one i expect 2-3 blocks
1615070861,any good pools please direct me:)
1615070882,If you’re already delegated just stick to it
1615070903,there are no good pools honestly. the end rewards will be just around 5% with fractional difference usually
1615070974,Find a pool on Twitter that communicates effectively and frequently
1615071000,That’s the one thing I’ll say. That way you get good info consistently
1615071794,may i ask what pool you at
1615071924,Me?
1615072026,yeah whoever wants to tell
1615072041,Muggy pool for me
1615072087,ADV2
1615072537,and how did it went for ya?
1615072548,i delegate to NFT. Currently around 650k ADA staked in the pool. we are pretty new since it revolves around our startup
1615072563,dont know yet lol. yet to get first  rewards:) seems like in 2 weeeks or so:)
1615072593,hello u:) u started?:) I am happy to join to support 😛
1615072649,hahahah I will write you again once we have more staked (1 mil+) no worries ^^
1615072876,oh i misread and thought you had 650k staked
1615072928,I wish lol hahah
1615073345,"ok guys. Im off to bed:) hopefull tomorrow we all wake up to greener pastures lol so far the only green I have is  CBSH that was mentioned by ""swiss"""
1615073370,we just need to wait... 🙂 its going to be green.:)
1615076983,bruh
1615076988,Kanyeeee
1615077002,I missed u
1615077039,just install yoroi or daedalus
1615077042,Yoroi wallet app on phone. Or Daedalus wallet on computer
1615077087,Percentage of staking rewards averages out the same over the course of a year
1615077089,well you always get around 5% interest per year
1615077098,Regardless of which pool you are in
1615077108,"""Blockchain and security experts will be announced at the start of development (see roadmap)."" - XSL seems to be at a **very** early stage 👀 Is this really a project worth joining?"
1615077315,"aha thats wrong, its not a fixed amount. however it can be 5$ per 3 weeks depending on how much you staked etc"
1615077330,interest annualised
1615077496,At approx 10k coins I got 6.5 coins for 4.4% this epoch
1615077502,Pretty damn good if you ask me
1615077523,Got over 10 ADA last epoch at 7.59%
1615077831,Lucky it cost me less than 2.5x that then 🙂
1615078057,Hit me up if you want to pump tommorow ;)
1615078107,;)
1615078257,why not tonight 👉 👈 😳
1615082774,"guys I have a few crypto mining apps in which you can install and use from your phone, I’ve been using them for a while now"

1615105002,$btc 4hr chart
1615105022,avoiding the head and sholder?
1615105034,(new to ta)
1615106614,Yesterday twitt was posted about that they will use Binance. So that’s something.
1615106869,Even if it goes to $0.03 that's profit
1615106973,Of course 10 times up.  I never got anything 10 times so far. Lol
1615107084,Not holding by breath for 10$ or 100 lol will sell half when it doubles to get my money back and the rest will leave to ripe 🙂 and hope for the best lol
1615110076,BTC 51k
1615110189,seems like its going to be green sunday lol
1615110233,Will probably be a red Monday then
1615110321,BTC needs to take off and grab every other coin by their hair and drag them all up
1615110450,Almost in the green again 👀
1615110545,anybody got a trezor promo code?
1615111165,Grats for getting Senior and almost going green😅
1615112250,how do you get those pics on the futures
1615112313,Pretty much all the top coins still declining versus BTC. ETH up but at a slower rate than BTC itself so basically we are all losing money holding anything other than BTC.
1615112492,we not losing we waiting .. loosing those who panic sale with loss.
1615112813,Little share button just above the details of your position
1615113082,Why do i always have to sell coins just before they fly up....
1615113377,always check the big brains channel when you in doubt
1615113482,Best way is never sell
1615113494,Even if you need the money to eat
1615113496,No eat
1615113498,No sell
1615113500,Only buy more
1615113729,My point is it’s easy to think that an altcoin is growing when in fact BTC is dragging the whole market up. An altcoin is only a better investment than BTC if it grows versus sats. USD comparison is faulty.
1615116581,"just bought my SYL. I was thinking knowing my luck, prices will go up another +0.001 by next week"
1615116950,"This button, but I think it's only in the mobile app"
1615116989,The answer is paper hands 👀
1615117431,$GVT to the moon 🚀
1615118075,Yeah thank tou
1615118086,Not gonna touch anything on futures app
1615118089,Might fuck it up
1615118097,"But when i sell, ill do it"
1615118142,Sausage fingers on paper hands are a recipe for poverty😂
1615118335,"Man the first day i made the position even that i had my man @Jeremyfto helping me figuring all out, i changed the leverage on the whole position (tho it didnt affect it at all) and i panic closed it"
1615118363,I felt like a doggo when it got zoomies
1615118460,It's green 👀
1615118464,Sausage fingers on paper hands 😂 😂 😂
1615119334,"have a look at chz boys, i know nothing about the coin except it looks good and ready to rock... make your own desicions..."
1615119389,it gained 26 mil vol in the last 1-2 hours if that means anything ...
1615120754,Who else here is ETH futures today?
1615121074,:godsgardener:
1615121191,on the train till 2k
1615121538,ETH will drop to $400 before rebounding
1615121560,Fibonacci?
1615121894,Ooft 40x I envy you
1615121903,"doubt it. his opinion has always been bearish on ETH. Every single message he has said about it was ""its going to drop"""
1615121967,"on a side note, I am very disappointed as I just woke up from a dream where we were already at the 1700$ mark"
1615122063,i wish your dream comes true soon
1615122164,"same. Sometimes I wish I was dream me. Last time I dreamt of trading, I dreamt that I made a 100x trade that resulted in 10,000$ turning into 10,000,000$. Thats a hard dream to wake up from"
1615122211,"not sure if i would like to have your dreams mate, going back to really must be so hard 😂"
1615122220,I had a dream a man was under my bed so idk
1615122292,I’d much prefer ETH at 1700 than that
1615122374,ETH is just having trouble this morning it seems. I went to bed because it was stuck at 1666 and it appears it keeps on trying to go up but is still stuck at 1666
1615122404,Im temped to go back to sleep 😂
1615122439,"this is just a nightmare, wake up and you will see ETH at 1800"
1615122465,I see BTC hit 50k for the 100th time
1615122649,Maybe today is a good day to short BTC until tomorrow?
1615122684,idk. its so hard to tell when the 50k is going to stick
1615122696,eventually it wont hard dip like it has the last few times
1615122736,"eventually it will break the cycle and get heading in the right direction. the question is, is this the 50k that breaks the cycle"
1615123692,Yeah like wtf is going on with btc and alts rn
1615123704,Whats the explanation for this occurrence
1615123722,Its not a correction right?
1615123728,Didnt btc correct recently?
1615124375,what do you mean Richy?
1615124466,if BTC would go sideways for some months that would be great no
1615124477,atleast you can make some profits trading then
1615124754,Heh last week i dreamed i was earning actual cryptos while playing tarkov
1615125801,what coins will you guys be looking at tonight during the pump?
1615126265,Could eth be having a reversal of todays downtrend?
1615126682,nvm 🤣
1615127033,i think ill participate in tonights pump
1615127036,and itl be my last one
1615127127,"I sold some of my OCEAN at ath before
Was it a good idea or not??"
1615127463,partial selling off is a good idea if you want to preserve profits short-mid term
1615127471,depends on ur strategy really
1615127552,"i usually do it if im confident i can buy back in lower, or if its a short term play and im leaving it for more than a few hours"
1615127629,"for example, overnight, if i predict a rise i can sell off 50% at my target price. that way if it hits and goes up, ill still be able to take advantage of a higher price, and if it is the peak and it goes lower after, ive already gained profits so the loss is less harsh"
1615127722,What is even happening to OCEAN atm. Is it being pumped? Totally no support what so ever
1615127859,"Lucky for me, OCEAN Dipping Rn :))"
1615128016,anyone got a trezor promo code?
1615128837,"Btc moving side ways, but a lot of alts had a pretty inconvenient dip"
1615128844,Which doesnt make sense for me
1615128854,I would of expected alts to start doing their own thing
1615128877,"But for some reason, a lot are following a downtrend pattern or are just moving sideways"
1615128883,And not in a way thats easy to trade
1615128885,Btc can’t get passed 51k
1615128886,Atleast for me
1615128999,Time to buy ?

1615138400,"I hit -15% lol, my bot bougth MTH"
1615138462,i wanted to do 200%
1615138471,"and i could, BUT, my logic wouldnt allow it"
1615138485,what do you guys think about PAINT?
1615138557,"Saw the PPT run up all day, kicking myself fosho"
1615138566,Clear pre pump activity on it
1615138629,Depends which color

1615138682,purple one 😛
1615138692,do you think it could follow the path of NFY?
1615138753,"Apart from SYL and Casper, are there any upcoming ICOs people are buying?"
1615138787,Or thinking of buying
1615139910,KILT
1615139993,Who pumped?

1615142942,PPT was great
1615142951,got in at 12150 thanks to my private bot
1615142963,sold at 20719
1615142968,sweet %70
1615143009,18:58 h :binance:
1615143040,"but the problem is, my bot doesn’t have a selling logic at all. i just type how much % gain i want, and it creates order for that"
1615143073,anyone want to discuss and at least show me a way to create a selling logic?
1615143287,selling logic?
1615143326,"like ""sell it for 130%""?"
1615143379,"Nope. Like, bot increases or decreases the sell order based on current price"
1615143485,Any pump now in 3 min?
1615143497,"Simply put, bot has to set new stop order every time price increases"
1615143536,In 1h
1615143569,Check pump callendar
1615143682,Maybe MTH for the second one? Its still higher than average.
1615143698,lmfao i died
1615143721,Could just be people who panic bought in the minutes building up to 5pm and did not get to sell on time for PPT
1615144534,"Can someone explain to me why my PnL on binance is +€1000? I know it’s profit and loss but I didn’t make that much profit yesterday lol, sorry for the noob question"
1615144603,bugged
1615144605,dont worry

1615144702,Oh is that the time
1615144714,I always wondered when the next day was
1615144734,"note that there should be a huuuuge candle in last day, as it says +2861%"
1615144744,😂
1615144758,😂
1615144786,
1615144798,For me there is :p
1615144801,uh

1615144951,Won’t be today :’)
1615145287,I hope to see some green shit tomorrow when i wake up cause I’m bored by this market going sideways
1615145322,Heads up on NXS great time to buy easy profit
1615145326,With my luck i’ll wake up to bloody Monday
1615145379,makrets going sideways but the alts im in or wanted to trade in are still dipping

1615145701,Is anyone else loading up on XMR anticipating atomic swaps?
1615145855,@NotMatt you keep tripping me up. In another server I am called NotMatt lmao I'm like wait did I type that lol
1615146089,so are you matt
1615146091,or not matt?
1615146207,Technically seen I am. But not the original one
1615146212,this is breaking my brain
1615146638,Which coin do you think will be pumped after 10 minutes?
1615146735,MTH
1615146853,Again?
1615146895,Not actually financial advice. I am not a registered advisor nor can predict the future. Kappa
1615147106,dont buy into the next pump
1615147110,no way it will be good
1615147251,RDN
1615147258,Doesn't look to good atm
1615147276,Lame pump
1615147289,i wanted to help you guys by giving the binance link and the link got removed .-.
1615147377,nice scam
1615148541,good advice
1615148560,7% gain for bots
1615148583,"Yeah I got around 7%, but thats still quite risky with the waves, can easily land below 0% there"
1615148588,The last one was way safer
1615149677,yo
1615150858,"Great, you want to sell us the bot?"

1615152054,"Hello guys, any opinion on Bscpad ?"
1615152557,"NXS pump incoming 10pm , you're welcome 😊"
1615153897,How have people's experiences been with kucoin pumps vs binance?
1615154530,you're 6 hours late
1615154626,10pm isn't for 5 hours bruh
1615154670,it's 11pm CET.
1615154683,and it's always 10pm somewhere
1615154723,It’s 10pm here
1615154731,the hours thing is worse than imperial metrics
1615154757,It's OK if you specify the time zone. Imperial metrics will be fucked up no matter what
1615154770,uh
1615154772,kinda yes
1615154786,i still dont know what a fucking ounce is
1615154793,or oz or whatever is written
1615154801,that depends on whether it's liquid or solid
1615154804,and i studied physics at uni
1615154807,probably also where it's from
1615154808,on what
1615154815,does it matter???
1615154823,there are liquid ounces and solid ounces and those are different units
1615154828,ok
1615154831,im out for today
1615154837,"not really, because the metric system is clearly superior"
1615154844,gotta take a painkiller cause headache is killing me haha
1615154852,just don't take an ounce
1615154859,🤣
1615154866,no im taking 500 mg
1615154889,That's probably one fahrenheitfoot of an ounce or something like that
1615154898,yeah
1615154903,a hotdog per cow
1615154907,or whatever units
1615154911,bye till tomorrow

1615155553,anyone in here buying NFTs
1615155727,"love this chat, defintiely feels very SEC compliant in here and I am not a securities agent."
1615155732,im trying to make one NFT
1615155740,came back just to say
1615155748,I was in another discord where some guy was investing in nft
1615155748,coinbureau made a vid about ETH
1615155752,might want to check it
1615155761,He bought dragons and then sold sets of dragons
1615155771,And property off land or something like that
1615155780,Didnt investigate further :=
1615155786,But he was convinced
1615155799,Yeah you can buy digital property in games and trade stuff you earn like fortnite skins on blockchain
1615155804,"NFT, never fuck turtles"
1615155858,it will be huge
1615155875,The turtle? Doesn't really change my mind though
1615155920,So you invest in SAND en ENJ then?
1615155944,theres a lot of ways to invest in it right now
1615156071,it allows you to own digital art
1615156091,you can invest in the exchanges people are selling them on as well
1615156259,"What is the market gonna do, red or green"
1615156275,Where do I put my stuff in before I go to sleep
1615156277,Brown
1615156277,I think a huge amount of NFT activity will happen on the ETH blockchain but there are seperate chains like RARI and ENJ for NFT that arent as expensive
1615156288,buy nft art
1615156292,Lol
1615156296,Too much effort man
1615156306,What art? :p
1615156312,Where do I sell it again
1615156325,I’m not an artdealer :’)
1615156349,everyone with a crypto wallet will be an art dealer
1615156354,thanks to nft
1615156361,i tried to send a link but whatever.
1615156383,"theres lots of work on opensea, rarible and mintable"
1615156402,not much harder than using amazon
1615156422,I get stuff like collectables
1615156428,But art?
1615156431,Idk
1615156435,its a huge store of value for massive corps
1615156445,they buy tons of art and borrow against it
1615156461,@Sausage Destroyer Thank you for the warning on enj. I've been wondering all day about when they best time to exit (for now) would be.
1615156465,its just now they can buy digital art and borrow against it
1615156508,big banks and investment firms buy art because it doesnt depreciate
1615156515,its like a really pretty bond
1615156524,Yea but physical art
1615156529,Of famous painters
1615156541,Not a jpg from grimes
1615156552,Because it’s a proven asset
1615156586,You could be right I guess but not sure we are there right now
1615156595,"the banksy nft is worth 6 figures easily, literal kids are selling their gifs for half a million dollars"
1615156602,not listing
1615156604,selling
1615156627,all these nft naysayers sound exactly like crypto naysayers in 2009
1615156653,the beauty of the NFT is that it is unique and forever on the blockchain
1615156661,as long as that chain is alive so is the art
1615156691,But it is not unique. Anyone can copy your gif
1615156717,"no, you can sue it's called copyright law and it exists for a reason"
1615156741,yes if its something easily copied obviously
1615156760,"but if it is your original work and IP then no, no one can copy your gif and sell it"
1615156772,which is why this is a big deal for artists
1615156783,and such a rush into the space
1615156814,trying to learn about NFT's - only works for digital / 2d media? not IRL art like physically made stuff?
1615156839,no
1615156845,you can make a physical work
1615156859,and issue a certificate of authenticity on the blockchain
1615156865,which changes hands with the work
1615156875,you write the nft address on the certificate
1615156887,banksy sold an nft backed print
1615156891,and burned the print
1615156899,the nft is now worth more than the print
1615156909,oh shit FR??? so I can make gorgeous pieces of jewellery from my super rare precious gems and turn it into an NFT?
1615156912,and what is awesome
1615156919,is every time the work changes hands
1615156926,youg get a royalty
1615156936,which never happens IRL
1615156937,Absolutely. Provided there's a perceived value.
1615156954,its cool
1615156976,"I only make in platinum, gold and my gems are collected over a decade, only the rarest things that arent mined anymore as the deposits are depleted"
1615157016,"yep, someday that might actually be worth less than the actual data behind it"
1615157021,weird but true
1615157031,👍🏽 would you say your NFT is a place to store value or is there another utility?
1615157057,its not just art
1615157066,someday your house will have an NFT deed
1615157080,"store value but it would have artistic value, im classicaly trained in contemporary goldsmithing"
1615157082,all assets will migrate to the blockchain
1615157132,m'lady im trying to get a complex math problem into an NFT
1615157163,"which its aspect its a minecraft reactor design, but heh, its honest work"

1615157289,im freaked out too bro
1615157293,ur not alone!
1615157312,"most of the stuff i make has weird art value, i.e. a ring made out of LITERAL MAMMOTH TUSKS"
1615157314,"its my fault, i forgot 18k is the normal price for a 30 second audio clip"
1615157319,mb bro
1615157337,I LOVE VOLATILITY
1615157346,yeah its crazy out there
1615157365,but dont write it off
1615157376,where are people selling these NFTs? how does one 'make' one?
1615157405,"opensea, rarible and mintable are 3 of the biggest marketplaces"
1615157440,they all allow you to mint an nft by uploading an image and filling out the metadata
1615157448,some markets you can list for free
1615157456,others you have to pay the gas to mint the nft
1615157487,minting just ties your image or sound to a unique token
1615157532,for real
1615157533,"obviously there's a lot of people selling shit, the barrier for entry is almost 0 on free minting sites"
1615157534,can i buy one?
1615157567,my rings got stolen at my uni and been looking for some good ass rings
1615157638,"the sites that you mint for free, the exchange will take gas fees out of your listing price, others you pay the gas up front"
1615157849,sure thing dude
1615157902,i had a quick look at those three marketplaces and none seem to have any physical items ?
1615157911,some do
1615157937,many dont

1615158047,this guy gives a good rundown
1615158049,and where could i look at those
1615158249,superrare is another big marketplace
1615158318,anyway ya neckbeard nonsense haha lol who would every pay money for a rocket league hat lol who here $GME lmao

1615159849,@hollowviper You've been in this position for over 30 hours?
1615159882,"You need to invite people to this server, 5 invites will get you access to that special channel."
1615160048,"it would not be fair on all the other members who did the work to gain access to that channel, if we just give it to you for free."
1615160125,ok.
1615160129,got it. thank u
1615160271,"Just spam a few DM invites to other servers, it takes literally 10 minutes and grants you access to knowledgewhich is worth real money"
1615160303,problem its the only server im in
1615160324,ive registrered for discord as found this during search about crypto
1615160356,never mind. i'll manage without  post grad super sycret information that one chosen privy to

1615160719,"I wanted to call myself diamond hand, but I guess I'm iron hand at best. 😦 ENJ is now at what I assumed it to be as today's top, but I sold at 1.36"

1615160757,maybe I'll put a little short on that spike 🤔
1615160786,i sold my 99p ( not sure in USD but close to what evr it is now  I assume).
1615160795,im sure it will go down and will be possible to re buy it
1615160927,Finally I also get to appreciate the red candles
1615160973,Make a dedicated anonymous Twitter account just for Crypto Twitter then
1615160988,that's literally what I did today
1615161000,Any predictions on rsr sats by end of day?
1615161091,ETH above 1700 is a good time for me to call it a day

1615161867,go for a lower leverage and/or increase your margin
1615161876,happened to me too once and now I make sure that it doesn't happen again
1615161936,yeah I'm still good ty 🙂
1615161943,but you're def right
1615162692,"Imagine if we all bought not ENJ but ENJ futures with leverage when it first was called at 0,69 🥺"
1615162706,damn btc is flying
1615162967,"@Sausage Destroyer we got major movement on ENJ, should we still hold onto the #🎓post-grads-podium call?"
1615163014,we are getting closer to 52.5k without the same amount of volume last time we touched
1615163016,a bit less
1615163024,so this could mean a more organic move i think
1615163323,rip my alt coins

1615163629,We shoulda listened to kanye and just buy btc
1615163808,I've been saying that for almost 13 years 😉
1615163863,So you must have hundreds of btc then 👀
1615163944,I've done ok. Liquidated some in the past. Bought stuff etc.
1615164002,I have my sell price in mind - and it's several multiples of today's price. I'm fairly confident BTC will hit six figures by end of the year.

1615174637,Has anyone heard of BAL? I see it has a 7 million supply. Anyone own any?
1615175038,wtf
1615175045,enj lookin nice
1615175048,Fr
1615175050,ENJ on the run
1615175059,Holy shit
1615175066,shits been on the run for 6hrs
1615175075,yea i havent been checkin it
1615175076,thats insane
1615175081,reminds me of the BNB run
1615175090,which ended in sadness for me
1615175091,probs gonna drop hard soon
1615175106,"Yeah, getting paper hands vibes"
1615175125,I bet if we sell now it rockets over 2.00
1615175238,sell walls on enj pretty small suprisingly
1615175245,"enj's market cap is 1.5b, it still has a long way to go man"
1615175247,fuckkkkkk
1615175378,"""has to correct at 1.7, right? right??""

*me saying the same for 1.6*"
1615175889,down she goesss

1615180972,Everything you've seen about enj so far has been a trailer. Wait and watch what happens today
1615181022,"@Alanox and @Post Grad 
Love this group. Absolutely, but you guys cost us a HUUUUUGEEE asset when dazz left. Kids already becoming big."
1615181037,And @Kyle too
1615181072,And it ain't going to come down.
1615181081,who
1615181123,They guy everyone here has been mocking. Also the guy that was super praised by Ryan matta yesterday
1615181124,i just had a dream that bitcoin dumped and then restored. it was absolute Christmas
1615181180,"Bitcoin dumping will not get enj restored.this is not happening because people are buying and selling. It's happening because people are playing games, buying nfts.. etc. The actual value movement is very little"
1615181200,This is what EVERYONE here failed to understand
1615181279,"not talking about enj here . talking about crash then 50000x in a few days. all the online kids instantly recognizes what was happening, bought in, and we're millionaires. was an actual dream lmao"
1615181475,Imagine not buying LUKSO 6 weeks ago
1615182523,doge
1615182553,ENJ!
1615182682,"It's not going to go up forever, you know."
1615182925,"> “Since NFTs are going through a hype cycle, that naturally raises the price of assets similarly associated with NFTs,” Mason Nystrom, research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “We’ve seen this happen in previous cycles with Ethereum competitors, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, and so this type of market reaction is pretty common.” 

https://www.coindesk.com/nft-marketplace-tokens-enj-rari-flow-crypto-risks"
1615183071,I’d say there are people who jumped on that are not vocal. Bit hyperbolic to say everyone didn’t understand
1615183102,What is your definition of forever? Hell i care if this is worth only $100 when im 100. I doubt i'll remember even having it.
1615183127,Im still all in btw
1615183152,Cant remember what it was like to invest in another coin
1615183168,What profit you made now?
1615183219,Ironically if you switched over to doge during the last hour or three you’d probably have made another 10% on your current ENJ profit
1615183243,"Had i listened 100% to dazz and not tried to make quick bucks with this, i would have been at 220% right now (from $4000). But i didnt listen, and i tried to swing trade. So im much lesser."
1615183257,Lol
1615183270,Doge and ENJ seem to be taboos on this group
1615183343,But @SeineJanie This experience has definately taught me the value of holding.
1615183423,It’s profit regardless
1615183438,Not clean though
1615183449,"The hype cycle will end soon. After that comes the Trough of Disillusionment. I would be very surprised if in a few months ENJ was still the hottest shit and not just any other asset.
But great to hear about your gains and learning the value of holding on."
1615183449,Need to launder ir
1615183463,Now the next step is to learn how and when to diversify. ☺️
1615183486,Pretty sure its going to hit $3 today or tomorrow. Most likely today.
1615183504,Got bored so jumped on DOGE with 1100 coins
1615183511,Hopefully make a minor amount
1615183518,10 by the end of the week right😉
1615183525,"That's not true at all. DOGE is good for quick profits when it pumps every once in a while, just not a viable long term investment."
1615183532,THEN we see a downturn (as per Dazz)
1615183545,Lol. Obviouslty. But still
1615183566,People just don’t like the long term stability of DOGE
1615183576,Its easy being a dick. Its hard making money
1615183579,Gotcha.
1615183601,"true I only meme because I 
was late"
1615183603,ADA trying to make a mini move again
1615183635,Not too late. Its falling a bit
1615183662,Remember the last time ENJ went up quick. It came back a decent amount and then pumped again
1615183665,anyone getting OM?
1615183682,@Post Grad have a method to buying new coins
1615183682,fuck this uniswap
1615183715,went from 0.36 to .046 while i am figuring out to send fund to uniswap
1615183717,"And ENJ has absolutely not been a taboo topic, it was pointed out by CryptoDomme from the Post Grad podium for great profit. It's just when people starting to dump their life savings into one coin and get overly attached that we will try to caution and get people to manage their risks accordingly. Nothing personal against ENJ at all."
1615183759,"Making some quick coin on doge, albeit small amount"
1615183770,"Doesnt matter. Dazz predicted this back when ENJ was at 0.76. He was ridiculed by everyone, and left. 

Who lost eventually? Us"
1615183796,I would have absolutely loved it if he was in this group. I lobbied to make him post grad too.
1615183809,Dazzz actually predicted it at $0.56 which is when I first bought
1615183821,Oh yeah
1615183833,There are plenty of other coins that get recommended that end up not panning out. Its great that he predicted it and I hope he made a lot off it BUT it could have not
1615183851,Dazz has predicted 3 coins for me. All 3 of them panned out great
1615183872,"But his predictions were not lottery, he researched the company for weeks like it was his job"
1615183885,Exactly
1615183887,who is Dazz
1615183901,Someone this group will never see again.
1615183910,You will know of him soon though
1615183913,"I still need to meet someone who answers to the question ""what is your occupation"". ""Crypto trader"""
1615183915,"Great well he only publicly recommended one that I saw. Still not a bad idea to exercise caution like what post grads recommended. Even with maximal research and everything being in place, it can still go south"
1615183939,Crypto is like that. Sometimes things that shouldnt go up do and sometimes things that should go up dont
1615183944,He publically reccomended 2 coins. XVS and ENJ.
1615183948,He’s been going on about doge as well
1615183955,Absolutely not!
1615183961,Oh yeah. 4 coins!
1615183975,I jsut didnt invest in doge cause it broke me last time
1615184001,Absolutely yes! Crypto isnt a guarentee. There are over 7000 coins. You are telling me that there isn't a single one that is great that isn't making it?
1615184011,There are 100% great coins that dont pan out
1615184046,"When there is over 7000 coins, some diamonds are going to fall through the cracks"
1615184064,"Absoltely not! 

RESEARCH and LOGIC drive crypto! Its completely predictable if done right. Even over the stock market for that matter. 

I'm learning some of this now, but unfortunately its different for different coins, and thats what Dazz has nailed i think"
1615184096,Ok keep on believing that bud. Research helps pick out good picked but some good picks dont work out
1615184101,Think we need a channel based on @Cryptoknight love of Dazz
1615184113,and someone is going to invest in a coin that is worth 0.00005 euro now that will eventually hit 1 euro
1615184125,Absolutely man. Not even denying that. I will follow Dazz blindly
1615184139,There is no guarantee that a coin worth that little will reach that much
1615184145,There will be coins that fail
1615184148,Because you didnt research them right
1615184159,eventually maybe with the amount idk. eventually shit should stick if you throw enpugh
1615184160,Will doge break 6c today
1615184178,"@Jeremyfto Lets take an example here. 
Lets talk about Doge. 
Do you think research could have predicted this?"
1615184186,The market volatility at this moment is really freaking me out. Insane volumes across many coins
1615184193,Things are flying up and down like crazy
1615184204,Please be careful if you are trading right now
1615184225,the volatility has desensitized me lmao. going up and down 2k a day has become normal life
1615184257,WTF is that buying volume for Doge
1615184260,Dude..
1615184261,"Doge has been a meme coin for a long time that goes up and down based on media attention. There is no ""research"" being done on doge. Its 100% media driven"
1615184274,It doesnt even have white paper
1615184279,"Someone is pumping is big time, its not good"
1615184281,"Congratulations, you just did 2% research on doge"
1615184299,"Like I said, it doesnt even have white paper which is the purpose of crypto"
1615184302,Musk will tweet soon on doge to push it further xD
1615184308,"Stuff like this is what makes it a maybe coin. If you research it properly, you can predict the rise and fall"
1615184344,You cant research your way into predicting the media attention. It goes up and down based on it
1615184353,you can hop on early enough and make profits
1615184361,I hopped on at 0.03 and got out at 0.08
1615184384,but there is no predicting a tweet or a media post that gets big attention
1615184407,problem with musk and other influencers is they have conflicting interests. when they smack talk they wanna invest and if they talk it up they are already completely in
1615184440,i mean its a great pump and dump scheme. but it hurts the coin in the long run imo
1615184453,You can predict media attention at times too.
1615184463,Like Doge on Nascar for example
1615184474,ADA pretty much waiting on an Africa announcement before it blows up
1615184551,I don't think Nascar is viewed enough to people that actually buy crypto for it to be a big media event for Doge. Most race car fans are boomers who don't understand crypto at all. Its really cool that it got on there BUT the target audience isnt optimal
1615184585,Musk tweets work well because a lot of people who follow him follow tech in general
1615184586,"Ok. Guess its not the right research, its the right conclusion required too."
1615184617,But there is no predicting a musk tweet
1615184631,He literally publically said dump crypto last week
1615184642,This week he is back on doge train
1615184647,Sure. Thats why i said _MOST_ media attention. What does musk have to do with the current gains that doge is seeing?
1615184649,ofc wants to buy low
1615184666,Yes but that tweet was unpredictable
1615184671,Musks attention is a pump and dump.
1615184700,it's predictable for musk and his friends
1615184716,FOMO'ing again?
1615184717,Thats not predictable. Thats insider information
1615184731,lmao yeah
1615184752,I'm NOT talking about must tweeets. They pump Doge for a bit and die. Im talking about predictable shit that does what it did to doge right now
1615184774,Hmm 1.59 may have been a good entry point for ENJ just before
1615184783,Hit me up with one predictable cause to doge's success currently
1615184803,something that I could have seen before it went up and latched on to
1615184804,doge will be over a dollar EOTY
1615184806,Easily
1615184828,"source: some guy on discord, dont ask further questions"
1615184848,If its over a dollar by EOTY Ill buy a pizza
1615184863,for me too right
1615184865,may as well
1615184868,maybe
1615184898,🙄
1615184926,Hopefully we will hit 1800 on ETH in the next few days. Would really like to hit 2k by the weekend
1615184967,I think we have like 10 days left for it to hit 2k for my feet pics lol
1615184973,NASCAR!!!
1615184988,And theres something else that Dazz was talking about
1615184999,I have already stated that this was not an optimal factor
1615185009,Why do you know about it
1615185012,most people who watch nascar dont even know what crypto is
1615185017,Would it be easy to swing this?
1615185025,the target audience is not optimal
1615185028,It doubles then halves every day
1615185038,"Why do you know that Doge was on Nascar. Because you're a crypto enthusias, not a nascar enthusiast!"
1615185047,Can’t send link mr taxman
1615185053,Rapids on coingecko
1615185075,I actually didn't know doge was on nascar until you said it because YOU are a doge enthusiast aka someone who is already on board
1615185088,I dont watch nascar
1615185094,Think SKY was a coin a few people milked the hell out of recently. Always ebbs and flows
1615185124,"We'll its just you then. Because this news was flashed all over the media a DAY after it was announced. Research. 

Im in marketing. This is 101."
1615185162,What you are saying is that Jimmy Fallon should only have comedians promote his show.
1615185191,You realize that most of cryptos target audience streams instead of watching cable tv nowadays right? aka no news
1615185212,Right. I forgot twitter and facebook died.
1615185212,"Yeah but besides shoving it in people’s faces, what else are they doing to promote their product?"
1615185225,until John and Jane Doe's get in
1615185228,Whats the product here?
1615185234,"As someone in marketing, you know these things are multi-faceted"
1615185248,You need to cater to a wide audience in multiple ways
1615185269,Very few people under 30 use facebook. I didnt see anything on twitter
1615185272,You’re talking about DOGE. Which is what I am replying about
1615185303,that was an a good pump
1615185320,DOGE is a meme coin. Not a product. You're missing the point of the conversation here
1615185320,Yeah I enjoyed the 5-6% I made
1615185373,I don’t think I am. You’re talking about DOGE being advertised on NASCAR which is a marketing ploy
1615185396,"Regardless of whether it’s successful or not, it’s a marketing ploy"
1615185408,I dont think they even know what the point is. They were talking about research making a good coin but now they are talking about doge which they just referred to it as a meme coin
1615185416,can’t complain. gratzi to everyone who caught it.
1615185466,It’s easy to say someone has missed the point without providing information to the contrary
1615185498,Oh Im not saying you missed the point. Im saying they forgot the point they were making to begin with
1615185499,"No. Im talking about how marketing works. This is obviously a game to someone and the _product_ as such is of no value. Im talking about how researching the movements of a coin can help predict it. So for example, we knew about Nascar 2 days before it happened. Because we researched it. It was also featured on a lot of crypto streams. Like TheRealMrDad. 

This is how the news spreads and value is pumped."
1615185554,Really? Lol
1615185556,"They literally were talking about how if you do the right research, you have a 100% win rate with crypto and that there are zero good coins that will fail and then they brought up doge into the conversation"
1615185585,it’s all a game. =). isn’t this like tips and tricks? the prima i daresay of guides.
1615185616,@Jeremyfto Read this. Im still on my point. Dont know what tf you're talking about now
1615185636,That was clearly not the point you started on. That is the point you pivoted to
1615185640,I haven’t actually said anything about research. I’ve simply said that what else are they doing to market their product that will cause a bump in their value? Which is the purpose of your bringing doge into the conversation in the first place as it was one of Dazz’s predictions.
1615185652,"You cant just state a NEW point and then say ""read this new point instead"""
1615185663,all here to make some cash after all not enlightenment.
1615185668,WTF! WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RESEARCH!!! Stop being wierd!
1615185683,lol well good pump. enjoy your evening.
1615185692,Good evening lad
1615185695,Marketing != Good Research
1615185713,They are two different things. You can market shit stuff
1615185742,Yea
1615185743,"Lol. WHAAAAAAAA.....

Cant stop laughting. 

No, marketing != Good research

But researching the market through the marketing done for it == 50% good research"
1615185784,I can market the shit out of a shit product. That doesnt make it any less shit
1615185799,lots of good projects with little marketing ;)
1615185845,"Once you do, i will start looking into that product. Still dont know how, but Dazz did it, and did it very well. 

Also, sometimes it doesnt matter if its a shit product. If you're looking to make quick gains, you might even just look at the quality of marketing and the projected impact on the market"
1615185846,Did you know that every good coin has a 100% win rate and none of them die apparently?
1615185861,yea
1615185864,ur late to this
1615185865,🙄
1615185869,I must be
1615185892,I wish I lived in a world where all the good coins had 100% win rates. Then there would be no risk to crypto
1615185906,And inflation would occur pretty quickly
1615185933,"anybody here invest in $GTH ? Gather network?
they provide ad-free monetization for publishers, where ""readers"" share processing power to contribute to host...  price already 5x over the last month and mainnet lauch is next month"
1615185943,poggers
1615185968,Which goes back to my point: You can have a great product that you do maximal research on and it can still fail. Dont put any money you aren't willing to lose into crypto
1615185968,Would if it was available on binance
1615185988,There is still risk even when you minimize the risk with research
1615186000,I dont know.. I cant use Binance here
1615186009,"I checked, it’s not there"
1615186047,they seem to have a good product with revenue pre launch.. I just dont know how they are able to use visitors computing power
1615186060,white paper is pretty detailed on business side of things
1615186101,"You can do maximum research, but if the product fails, you're the one who was wrong. You either didnt research right, or came to the wrong conclusion. This is fairly common, and how most things end up. My original point was that somehow, Dazz has the knack to do this right. He's like a fucking train. Does not draw conclusions unless he can validate them somehow."
1615186136,"Anyway, either you get it or you dont. Even if you get it, odds are you wouldnt be able to use that infomation in any way just like me. So diesnt matter i suppose"
1615186175,"You are still on the ""100% win rate for good coins"" train of thought which means you dont understand how crypto or investing in general works. Your research can be right and it can fail. Thats how investments work"
1615186251,Thats why they tell people not to take a second mortgage or use their rent money. There is no 100% guarentee. Im sorry bud. Good research minimizes risk. It doesnt remove it
1615186254,Absolutely not! Nowhere close to that train.
1615186271,I think you and me are talking about 2 different things
1615186287,"You literally just said ""If a product fails, you were wrong about the product"" hence you dont believe in a good coin failing"
1615186309,"On a lighter note, this is what happens when you add me to your telegram channel without my consent"
1615186350,"But you were right. This is an idealistic view. If something failed, and you thought it wont, then you were wrong. Lol. WTF"
1615186416,There is always a chance for ANY coin to fail. You can do your research but there is no removing that risk regardless of how thorough you are. You can be right and the coin can still fail
1615186443,I just read this. This is obvious
1615186447,There is ALWAYS a risk no matter how promising something is. This is why good investors diversify
1615186460,No good investor puts ALL their eggs in one basket
1615186472,"Again, obvious. You wanna scroll up and see what im talking about? What we started talking about?"
1615186504,You literally just put the blame on the researcher and not the risk involved. Its not always incorrect research that leads to trades failing
1615186514,"""You can do maximum research, but if the product fails, you're the one who was wrong."""
1615186547,100% accurate research does not lead to 100% success rate
1615186575,Research only minimizes risk
1615186609,Is the Ada-Africa announcement coming very soon?
1615186628,Or chances are we have to wait quite some time?
1615186647,"""I don't know how the fuck he did it"" is actually a warning sign. Everybody should be able to explain how they came to their conclusion and it needs to be more than ""oh, I found this Enjin thing and I think it's gonna be big because they got some famous company logos on their website!"""
1615186745,He explained it 100%. Maybe even 150% to the point that it was very hard to catch up with all the research data he posted here and on our other group. Not shooting in the dark here man. This shit was real 100%
1615186749,also history does not predict the future
1615186766,Theres that fomo again 🤣
1615186789,stahp 😂 i was wanting to add. But maths and trends do
1615186797,"@Matt If you want ENJ, in 40 mins would be a good time."
1615186833,Go back and read context.
1615186911,"If a guy comes up to you and tells you that he can flip $100 to $200, and you give him the money, you were wrong for concluding he could. What his problem is is his problem, but you were still wrong. 

Maybe it would help if i write this in code?"
1615186919,Tough one to predict at this point. Feels like we’re fairly close though. The hard fork got all the hype the past month which is why the price went up so much. The Africa news is a bit unpredictable at the moment.
1615186958,Aaand I got wiped. 💀 enj performed just too well tonight
1615186978,Shit! Forgot about you
1615187014,I sold at 1.16 lol
1615187022,You would
1615187034,Cant win them all :’)
1615187053,Can win the smart ones. But noooooo
1615187076,"Initially I expected enj to go up to 1,5. After it didn't move over 1,4 again last afternoon, I sold the long which I opened too late at 1,36 and made a small profit."
1615187097,Then I traded a bit back and forth and finally opened a short way too early
1615187101,And I'M paper hands? lol
1615187111,Dazz has 300 pounds in his portfolio and started like some months ago
1615187119,Could be that he is right on some stuff
1615187120,Its ok man. Happens. Still time
1615187122,You would have sold at 1.10 :p
1615187130,But can take everything for the truth :p
1615187136,Still in your own world i see. Have fun
1615187173,Yea my world where I am carefully with my money
1615187185,"I did, but i bouhgt back with 100% portfolio at 1"
1615187186,"Dude, he shilled that coin to me in DMs as well, to the point of desperation when I'd didnt jump on the hype train as well.
Never did I see solid research that pointed to 3 dollars. Only general stuff why ENJ will be big and never retract majorly."
1615187256,"Dont know what he DM'd you, and not sure what shilling is. But on Mr. Dad's Group, he had everyone convinced with the research data he was posting. @JLeh22 can confirm"
1615187515,"Who is talking shit here about my boy Dazz...
You are just jelly you didnt jump on the train at the right time"
1615187606,And shilling or not ENJ has broken its ath second week in a row
1615187607,You arent on Mr Dads group are you?
1615187615,Im not
1615187700,Any other Dazz supporters here (from before results)
1615187710,He sounds amazing
1615187716,Stop it
1615187723,lol
1615187733,"but i mean it, not a fomo commet"
1615187738,Any Matt supporters here (from before these ridiculous fomo comments)?
1615187738,sounds dedicated & smart
1615187812,What you talking about here
1615187816,More beef we got
1615187817,?
1615187831,Sup Snoop Doge!
1615187956,:godsgardener:
1615187986,ENJ $3 tonight/tomorrow/2 days! Dont ask me for research on that. Ask Dazz! He may or may not confirm the same.
1615188055,Easier to say at some point over the next two days isn’t it?
1615188071,Easier to say at some point over the next two days isn’t it?
1615188080,Fuck! I LOVE whats happening to ENJ right now. KaCHING!
1615188099,"It was, but i keep forgetting about the time difference. Most of the action happens 7am my time"
1615188125,Gone back 20c the last hour. Traders be cheering they’ll buy more up later
1615189017,It’s gone
1615189052,Jesus fuck enj
1615189311,I sold 0.99p (GBP) only have 10 left. But once it deeps down below 1£  (0.80) I’ll buy more 🙂
1615189471,I rebought 3.4K ENJ again in the what I hope is dip :p
1615189501,Just bring me to 1.7 and I’m good
1615189509,💵🤠
1615189877,Yes. Jesus fucked ENJ.now it's more valueable than holy water
1615189894,Anyone in on sushi
1615189929,You were one of the prime dazz pissers btw if I rember correctly. Strange how u changed your mind.
1615189960,Dm please..can't send u messages
1615189983,@TheOne need the dream team back together again
1615190005,whut?
1615190015,I talked with on DMs for days lol
1615190019,with him*
1615190035,I went almost all in on ENJ :p
1615190046,no clue what you are talking about
1615190073,Can’t dm u either says we not on same server. We spoke before though 🤔 maybe u should make me ur Friends :)))) as it says u only accept@message from friends
1615190110,Those who not on ENj or too late. IOTA is next 💆🏻‍♂️🤠
1615190115,Stone me now lol
1615190293,Dont leave ENJ. We're nowhere close to target
1615190539,"Yep one here, I miss him"
1615190873,why did he leave?
1615190942,Well a lot of people just challenged him when all he was trying to do was provide them the reading
1615190992,I read a lot of it and it held up@from a business point of view; as soon as the market catches up with what they’re doing the coin will fly
1615191024,not sure thats 1 to 1 the case :p
1615191048,"It wasn't just providing research or anything, he literally nagged people to also buy in.
Sad that he left because of a strong headwind."
1615191106,So what you're saying is you can distinguish a con man from a crypto prophet by how much profit they provide you if you follow them?
1615191146,"No, im saying that kittie feels that way from the way she switched sides"
1615191163,again when did I switch sides? :p
1615191167,and not a girl btw
1615191179,Apologies if im mistaking you for someone else. Maybe im wrong.
1615191180,I have been buying ENJ since it was 0.79
1615191212,I just gambled wrongly on the correction it would made and didnt rebuy the dip
1615191224,"Ok. I like you again 😆 
probably was someone else with a similar avatar"
1615191243,Sorry
1615191251,"No one is jealous. In fact, I'm happy for y'alls profits! But don't say you haven't been warned when all goes to shit and you're the last one holding the shitbag of a hyped coin. Have seen it too many times."
1615191285,"@SeineJanie Also, dont get me wrong. I love what you guys do too. I was just super pissed when literally everyone on this group came down on Dazz when he was making perfect sense"
1615191312,"I think if he'd had dialed down the excessive shilling, ppl might have taken him more serious."
1615191315,the issue is that he is hyping too much
1615191323,saying ENJ will ge to 10-15 or something
1615191325,What is shilling?
1615191329,that was a little too much :p
1615191343,https://decryptionary.com/dictionary/shilling/
1615191346,"See his brain, not his mind. My motto for everyone"
1615191350,Thats why i dont mind dicks
1615191375,Lol. How would he gain from it?
1615191392,I dont know why people shill tbh
1615191407,but you have random people shilling each day 😂
1615191435,"I mean, isn't that the entire purpose of these chats lmao"
1615191438,its not like we are gonna bump ENJ
1615191452,PnD in general that is
1615191480,"Exaclty, we have people coming in and saying buy this, or im buying that. Dazz never said any of this. He simple keep sharing his thoughts on the future of the coin. 

Stop with the politically correct stuf and we might make some money"
1615191498,"Oh hyped coin... Isnt thats the main driving force behind crypto? Even now in 2021 crypto is no where near mainstream daily purchasing use. Most coins are""interesting"" promising projects and whole market is based on hope and hype, like any other thing we give value to. Well exept that precious metals are actually tangible"
1615191527,"Simple: If he is long and gets more people to buy the same, his position appreciates. That's basically all ppl do on CT. They're not just giving you nice advice for free, they usually want you to join their cause because they got in early. Not saying that everybody has the reach to manipulate a market, but it's not always only ulterior motives that play into someone recommending an asset. And if it gets that excessive, it's a red flag."
1615191529,yea but hyped coins can also drop off quickly
1615191544,"Exactly, lets not forget, crypto is 99% perception and 1% value. Everything you are buying into is hyped somehow."
1615191549,"Now with dazz I didn't get the feeling he was malicious. He came across to me as inexperienced and hyped, but nothing harmful."
1615191570,I think thats correct
1615191575,good intentions
1615191614,"But there **will** be people that talk the same and just want to dump their crap onto you before everything goes south and we just want everyone prepared for this possibility.
End of story."
1615191622,Yes but there is pure hype and market driven hype
1615191688,"This was not the case with Dazz. He gave plenty of info to derive a conclusion from. Anyway, not the point"
1615191690,"I didn't read 100% of what @SeineJanie but from what I read I completely agree with him, dazz wasn't some genius who knew this would happen. He was some hyped fan hoping for the best"
1615191691,Lets move on.
1615191727,Dude.
1615191747,If only you had a clue
1615191752,There is no evidence the price will skyrocket like he said. Just lots of news on the coin doesn't mean it will x100
1615191756,Yes indeed. Any hype can give profits though but in long term people just need to know difference between dogehype and something like ADA hype
1615191760,Lots and lots of evidence
1615191773,"Well, not evidence, but inclination"
1615191775,"No, he just posted screenshots and news from ENJ website"
1615191788,that's not evidence
1615191829,"analyzing past prices, the price strength, best entry points, how the coin could react to BTC, would be analyzing and showing evidence"
1615191863,That would be spoon feeding
1615191878,"Im not having this conversation. 
I dont disagree with you. But that doesnt mean there is ONE RULE for everything"
1615191881,That would be proving it's a legitimate investment
1615191892,not just a hype train
1615191904,When have the post grads here ever given a legit reason?
1615191919,That doesnt mean its not research driven
1615191929,Just because he turned out partially right by hyping this one coin to the ban doesn't mean he was some kind of genius
1615191934,He provided enough info to get me interested and do my own research
1615191958,I think thats what we are here for
1615191964,"well when you ask a post grad a reason they can answer to you, and they have many calls before that prove their analysis too, dazz just had ENJ"
1615191979,and CRO
1615191986,dunno how CRO is doing
1615191988,"because you DYOR, but 90% of people don't"
1615191996,"Yeah he overhyped, but at the end of the day we make descision ourselves"
1615192087,"OH FUCK! Forgot about CRO. 

CRO, Doge, ENJ, XVS, ALGO short term. 

These are the places i made money, and all because Dazz EXPLAINED to me why they are worth it. With ENJ, it was a tad annoying because he would keep posting links to his findings. Must have gone through atleast 70 links proving to me that ENJ will be nuts"
1615192114,dont know what DOGE is doing in there
1615192119,he lost me on that 😂
1615192119,And thats probably why he gives the source info and expects you to draw your own conclusions. Cant have it both ways
1615192156,Thats not happened yet. Still on the books. ENJ first. Timing matters
1615192170,He predicted the 55k thing though yesterday
1615192186,55k thing?
1615192203,Doge went from 51 to 55 today
1615192219,It actually went higher than his prediction - to 59k
1615192720,"You looks so funny.... i talked about ENJ before you exist in this place and before Dazz also.
I did it also for CRO.
However Dazz did some good share about info. But here you will never see any post grad spamming ppl that they have to buy or insist on some crypto.
Prediction are prediction and he could be wrong. 
I found nothing extraordinary with that calls as i am in ENJ CRO since a while"
1615192762,But i will just no dms ppl with screenshot telling them every 10mins
1615192777,Thats totally stupid things
1615192787,Its hard being plebs like us swiss
1615192806,This is not about ENJ. Its about driving someone out of the group like that.
1615192814,But where is he ?
1615192818,He left
1615192825,Why ?
1615192836,Misunderstood
1615192841,Cause everyone here was a massive dick to him. Why would he? he was trying to help
1615192846,I just share with him couple of day ago did i miss something ?
1615192862,It says Propaganda in this definition; raising awareness of how the coin is used in gaming; which companies they’re working with and which markets they’re getting into is not propaganda it is business research - and I’m a market researcher for a living
1615192873,A lot. Then that fucking cunt Kanye showed up and solidified the deal
1615192890,But he is a troll lol
1615192901,And @felguerr I still think you're heavily underestimating him
1615192902,@Cryptoknight post grad and admin were in ?
1615192927,in what?
1615192954,I heavily underestimate everybody.... at the end of the day it is my own money and my bags are already big big enough to make me confident with my own work
1615192977,Now this place is for sharing dont need any heroes
1615192984,I will never insist
1615192990,But i could give advice
1615192993,"Well, you now have a martyr"
1615193004,Dont care
1615193016,Hitler?
1615193017,I had good relationship with dazz
1615193038,So if he left thats his choixe
1615193044,who's dazz?
1615193050,Who said anything to you?
1615193056,Your daddy
1615193071,Fuck see? Now i've becomg the troll
1615193081,>
1615193084,"If people are stupid enough to buy a coin on what someone thinks the chart is going to do next in here they deserve to lose, Dazz brought a coin to my attention and then provided enough info so I could read about it myself, instead of some of the other calls in here ....”SHT is breaking through guys get on it” crap"
1615193088,cunt u were always a paper hands troll
1615193111,Thank yoU!
1615193113,uh is binance dead
1615193132,Yeah. Got aquired by Apple
1615193147,o well time to go live under a rock
1615193147,Awwww. Thanks. And you were always my tissue paper.
1615193155,lmfao
1615193177,Thats a myth. Its not comfortable lying down with a rock on you
1615193190,Take this to frat chat. It’s degenerated heavily
1615193198,Unless you mean Dwanye Johnson
1615193201,"Info he shared are what we used to share when we talk about coin.
And we did a lot when talking about generals fundamentals and how identify good opportunities.
However i am not going to share every day updates. We give patterns then dyor"
1615193224,I did not understand whats the point here
1615193245,We were providing works before dazz and we will continue after
1615193261,And ppl@who arent happy could go to other discord
1615193265,"My point is, that if there are these ways of doing things, and if you saw potential in Dazz, what would be been best for the entire group, is to guide him on how to contribute here."
1615193290,Man i did say anything bad to him so i really dont understand
1615193333,he's just trying to make a point that nobody cares about
1615193336,I didnt say anything to you either
1615193343,Im talking about collective bad
1615193367,Think you need to walk away from this convo. You’ve worked yourself up to ridiculously high levels
1615193382,And ?
1615193391,He could stay and just block some
1615193405,And continue sharing to who wants
1615193417,Dont think it was charity
1615193449,What's the point your even trying to make here?
1615193462,"Anyway, doesnt matter anymore. I just hope this would be a good guide for the next Dazz."
1615193470,....
1615193577,"Mm we will think about a private chan in which no super heroes or martyr, no complain, no rubbish, no troll.... only sharing and learning"
1615193595,Thats actually a really good idea
1615193603,Even for non Dazzes
1615193614,No post grad either if this is the issue
1615193685,"Again, Post grads arent the issue. The vibe is. Its like when we see an alien and want to kill it before it says it comes in peace"
1615193706,It happen to me also i just blocked that ppl
1615193707,Or how mutants were hunted in Xmen because people didnt understand them
1615193709,"No no no, no more chats, it already went to shit when chat was split in two"
1615193728,The whole ranking thing on this is all a bit Animal Farm anyways
1615193749,Only crypto chat here. Remember that.
1615193762,"Thats it, thats the pinnacle of this conversation. Comparing Dazz to x men"
1615193782,Or a mutant with crypto powers
1615193845,Post grad asked to close the frat chan for your info but admin decision was different and we accept it. But just to let you know i expect that the place could become more skilled and adult discussion level
1615193904,So in my point of view i dont read when somebody comes and insist like never in a crypto even if he shares info etc
1615193935,However i admit dazz if i remember well was a good member but maybe ppl compared him to kayne
1615193956,Anyway he should stay here and chat in crypto chan and leave frat chan
1615193966,Nobody kick or ban him
1615193974,So final@stop
1615193984,No need to talk about this here
1615193990,Lets talk about money
1615194264,👍🏼 Is SYL going to be the next ENJ?
1615194281,😂😂
1615194304,Entry price 0.002938473004747494
1615194331,When do we get out best price though??
1615194377,When you connect to your super discord where all your super heroes/martyr will tell you
1615194500,I hope so!
1615194545,I hope so too. My first ICO since Bancor
1615194568,😫  its not on Binance
1615194587,Thats the whole thing with an ICO
1615194594,thats because they dont have a working thing yet
1615194596,:p
1615194664,How come SYL isn't listed on ICOdrops.com?
1615194839,What makes you say them?  What have you read?
1615194857,that was irony
1615194869,they target different goals
1615195225,"Woah, ENJ went up to 1.80 before dipping"
1615195255,Wait when
1615195261,one better: my avg entry price: $0.002730570561098 per SYL. Or were you talking about ENJ?
1615195291,Rename this discord « ENJ is the one »
1615195294,Any thoughts about LYXe?
1615195384,"0,001857142857 right here💪"
1615195392,soon to be a bit higher
1615195416,Appearantly some 5h ago
1615195436,Lmao you got me going there. Thought it was up again
1615195461,"In other news, get ready for 8% up on BTC. Don't ask for research. Just looking at what happend over the weekend."
1615195702,Where do people think SYL go? Anybody got any figures in mind?
1615195744,"to hit $1, it'll need a marketcap of $10bn. SOL already has a marketcap of $4.something bn -  so its not out of reach"
1615195784,"both SYL and Casper have 10bn tokens avail, so similar circumstances."
1615195839,"if SYL just matches SOL's marketcap, it'll be an increase of 14,990%"
1615195861,or it could completely flop
1615196172,"For anyone here interested, Word from Dazz: Ryan Matta is doing a live stream today. During this live stream, expect ENJ to gain at 3x/4x the current speed."
1615196217,Jesus
1615196252,I wasn’t particularly getting my hopes up but *jesus*
1615196288,
1615196294,Do you guys also have this feeling about alts. The feeling of drowing due to the amount
1615196299,and i mean I cannot go balls deep in all alts to get all the gainz
1615196315,yea
1615196318,same
1615196330,https://tenor.com/view/uncertain-nahh-indecisive-possibly-pete-burns-gif-20572197
1615196388,And as @Cryptoknight said its FOMO. But its really easy to get fomo because of the amount lmao
1615196416,I mean tbh I did go into ENJ but not much. Mostly just to learn how to use binance so that i can use it more responsibly in the future lol
1615196428,Screw that
1615196472,But you should all diversify after the ENJ craze is over
1615196517,Yeah not smart to keep 5000 euros in a alt that may crash after hype lol
1615196541,i joined you @Cryptoknight
1615196549,also 100% in ENJ again 😂
1615196587,Stepping out at 1.68 when we hit it tho
1615196592,Set a stop loss just in case BTC tanks
1615196603,BTC is the only wild card here
1615196605,Still expecting BTC to go up 8% by tomorrow evening
1615196662,it feels like i'm just gambling at this moment tho :p
1615196671,lmao thats the fun right.
1615196685,right.
1615196689,-depressed broke gif-
1615196704,Welcome to my last 3 days
1615196711,Set a stop loss please. Not too high tho
1615196733,I got FOMO into ADA from chat on here... and I'm down 15% 😢
1615196733,"If you are able to keep an eye on it, You can probably do a trailing stop"
1615196741,Me too!
1615196746,I was 12% down
1615196750,"yea I'm ""working"""
1615196753,That is the problem with FOMO lol. As soon as you get FOMO you are almost always too late
1615196761,@kittiewitty in a meeting atm lol
1615196764,that's what i'm thinking about ENJ
1615196771,looks way too pricey already
1615196779,but you can take 5-10% on the waves
1615196781,"I'm sticking to what I've already got, and just getting ICOs"
1615196789,Thats ok. Keep your phone on your crotch and keep looking down every 5 seconds
1615196798,if you buy ENJ now and holding it
1615196802,the market always does the opposite of what I think when I try to day trade
1615196803,then you are a mad man :p
1615196826,nah working from home so meeting on the one screen discord on the other
1615196846,something with a world wide pandemic
1615196853,not sure if you guys would have heard about it yet
1615196864,there is this weird virus thing spreading
1615196869,USA is like = what pandemic?
1615196872,You can still put binance on your phone and put it on your crotch and keep looking down during the meeting.
1615196876,I have been in the office 3 days since march 2020
1615196882,its crazy :p
1615196931,I've been back just a little less than that. Work in IT but volunteer for red cross and so have higher risk. Don't want to force my collegues to feel unsafe at work
1615196951,our offices are just closed
1615196958,I cant even go if I wanted
1615196983,During summer they were opened. And last week some people went to go give the plants water (that surprisingly survived)
1615197854,Hype from this info probably drove the price up already. It’s what happened with ADA 3-4 weeks out from the hard fork.
1615197979,Yep
1615197984,Id say you hodl it
1615197999,"Updates coming this year from iohk, could get back again"
1615198221,"Question is whether the upcoming ENJ launches (April 6 & another later in 2021) are simply hype and hot pitching or if they'll drive real world enj usage up, and judging by my real-world experience (through work) I've personally made a call they will. So atm I feel I'm basing my btc bag on faith more than my enj bag."
1615198416,(Still – didn't sell all my stuff and take my life savings ot move on it)
1615198435,Hold it for another month or two and I doubt you’ll be 15% down
1615198687,to greedy maybe?
1615198733,I really dont know what to do with ADA
1615198740,I guess i will just wait till i see it moving
1615198880,Depends where you entered I guess. Unless you don’t own any right now?
1615198905,"Once Charles announces Africa news, it’s going to be too late to jump on."
1615198916,no I moved out
1615198922,I needed my money to fill a hole 😂
1615198930,When's that live stream scheduled?
1615199020,he has only 10.4k followers tho
1615199476,>3/4x current speed
1615199486,whats ur research on dis br0
1615199492,pls share ur fax
1615199839,I exited on ENJ again
1615199850,thank you ENj for everything you do for me :p
1615199869,now it will for sure spike to higher levels
1615199895,Nah I timed that perfectly today @kittiewitty . Hopped out at 1.35 and then it went nuts lol
1615199931,every time you exit its a gamble right
1615199935,Luckily I made a little from the fluctuations of it after I finished work but big ragrets
1615199954,how did everyone do on PPT yesterday?
1615200005,"I wasn't in it, but it made me start building my own pump detection bot looking at that vid someone posted"
1615200019,what vid?
1615200037,+65%
1615200066,"good shit, how much budget?"
1615200071,not alot
1615200088,i dont risk large amounts on pump and dumps
1615200093,i also dont have large amounts
1615200095,but thats not the point
1615200098,yeah
1615200101,
1615200105,i did 2k in 4k out
1615200112,thats sweet
1615200113,could've gone for 150% profit but that was risky lol
1615200120,better safe than sorry
1615200164,Nice job
1615200181,thank you :D
1615200239,"i made 500 today from work, 2.5x pay is soooo nice"
1615200263,what coin is that?
1615200280,aud LMAO
1615201263,I just got excited when I saw a cup & handle pattern on my daily profits chart on binance 🙄
1615201482,Well it appears to work though just hit an all time high 🤭
1615201603,How do you get paid x2.5? x)

1615201907,Dont know. Dazz is in touch with Ryan
1615201917,I think today at some point
1615202339,What does PPT mean?
1615202343,I think ENJ will make another jump when it gets announced on other smaller trade platforms
1615202369,ppt is a coin
1615202370,one that was pumped
1615202384,We need deep first so I can re buy :)))
1615202406,Oh right
1615202417,Do u know when that will be?
1615202779,Someone's gonna blow
1615202848,"Not 100% sure, but i dont think we're dipping anymore. Support seems strong at 1.6. If we are looking at $3 in the next 10 hours, a dip is highly unlikely"
1615202870,Why dont you ask Dazz?
1615203039,Is he on other Discord’s
1615203058,Whats that?
1615203070,ENJ
1615203114,The coin that keeps on giving
1615203150,😩
1615203159,"Like, are you seeing this. This is after 12 hours of pumping"
1615203164,Can we rename the chat to enj-only-chat 😂
1615203176,We should rename the server to ENJ only server
1615203184,WE should rename earth to ENJ
1615203202,Is the soul made out of enj ?
1615203216,No. ENJ is pure
1615203221,"well, we have to run off of an enjin of some sort"
1615203238,and this one runs off of gainz
1615203259,YEEESSS! MONEY ENJIN!!!!
1615203283,the enjin engine never stops running
1615203293,(until it does)
1615203385,Projections say that ENJ will fall to $1 again after reaching $140 to start a new cycle for those who missed out this time. You got 4 years?
1615203540,only 140x?
1615203541,weak
1615203564,What about COTI guys? A lot of events announced in March
1615203626,Are you joking?
1615204326,Lmao
1615204393,?  In the coming days? Or the coming weeks?
1615204780,uhm market cap of enj is...?
1615204873,"$1,706,087,159"
1615204886,and bitcoin 900x that right
1615204897,i mean... its not impossible then but improbable?
1615204916,thered be a fuckton of hype behind if if people threw $1T into enj..
1615205141,Yes
1615205157,@Post Grad @Post Melon
1615205167,Yea just get it to 250b and 140$ each are there
1615205190,I WAS BEING SARCASTIC. Though $140 is a real possibilty in this year
1615205192,Why get enj when you could get lukso
1615205196,Hahahahah
1615205205,Lukso went from $1.20 to $19 in 3 weeks lmao
1615205214,Why use discord when you can use your dicksword
1615205229,>
1615205235,:whoozy:
1615205236,Why you think 140$ are possible
1615205249,Sounds like big no no to me
1615205262,$4 max on enj
1615205263,Sorry
1615205267,i've learnt over the last 3wks not to listen to this guy
1615205267,Its not about if its possible. Its about when it will happen. 100% it will be a BIG yes yes. Just need to strategise on when.
1615205274,It’ll crab after the end of the week
1615205282,Maybe if they started to use ENJ in NFT market instead of etherium and its huge gas fees
1615205302,"Lol. Would have worked a lot more if i was wrong. Where is ENJ now? And also $3 in the next 2 days, most likely in 10 hours"
1615205323,ol m8 paper hands
1615205345,Sorry I though you were talking about 140B Market Cap and got very bamboozled 😆
1615205347,Lukso has more legs on it to go to $140 than enj
1615205352,"Anyway, i think you've been a decent fellow in the past. So once you're over this phase of your life, let me know. I'll key you in on what we're really doing here"
1615205375,yeah im doin pretty good makin my own decisions ty
1615205433,"Yeah, that does seem like a stretch, but still possible. Think of it like this. ENJ doesnt run on the coins you buy. It runs on the games people play and the NFT's people buy. 

IMO investing in ENJ is the most diversified thing you can do in a single coin. You're basically addressing multiple industries together. So if one falls, big whoop."
1615205458,Good for you.
1615205503,"Just got off a zoom call with Elon “Mr. Sinbad” Musk, we were on wine and spoke at length about the prospect of a NFT moon cycle. He mentioned something about ENJ being made by weebs and we both started laughing. He gave me the signal to invest more in lukso. Nice guy."
1615205544,"that's funny, just hopped off a twitter spaces call and he called me a retard and told me to keep buying doge"
1615205565,Nice
1615205602,It’s funny when you’re on zoom with him and grimes starts crip walking in the background
1615205645,ankr
1615205648,buy it
1615205677,Holding VET since 4cent feels good man
1615205702,That’s why I’m holding it; the only issue with it is the kids playing the games can exchange their won/built items from the games into ENJ and some basic looking things get sold for big ENJ; 100 for a sword etc; so at what point to kids wake up abs realise they’re about to spend ENJ they’ve earnt in a computer game that actually has a market value of $170 for a bloody add on in a computer game.  This is the only worry with ENJ for me everything else about the coin is positive
1615205749,How sure are you that enj is not a panjeet scam
1615205758,I was told by the big man it might be
1615205764,But do keep buying doge. The useless coin is becoming relavant
1615205796,"LOLOLOLOLOLOLO

ONE WORD!





DYOR!!!

Actually 4 words. 
Do 5 mins of research, and if you still think its a scam, we'll talk"
1615205805,panjeet is not the scammer. Hes international postgrad student from a top IIT. Archit is the scammer
1615205821,Right so you know better than Elon...
1615205842,Do you want to join our next zoom call?
1615205847,It’ll be next Sunday
1615205850,I do
1615205852,I spoke to elon last night as well. He warned me about you

1615205902,Zoom of what
1615205925,elon musk and panjeet
1615205926,The video conferencing software? Did you not live through covid lol?
1615205945,Oh my bad I thought you were asking what zoom was
1615205969,It’s just a weekly 15 min chat me and Elon have
1615205983,Sometimes it’s more people than just us
1615206016,It would be cool to get some strangers in from good discord servers involved - his suggestion
1615206038,#icochat - so we're pretty sorted for March ICOs: Casper and SYL. Has anyone found any decent ICOs in April?
1615206045,anyone here super knowledgeable about nano on hand?
1615206085,Got my hands on some Enj as well
1615206113,:virgin:
1615206123,"So i'm sorry to tell you, but it'll drop now"
1615206143,Yeah enj is scam 80% sure

1615206406,And lukso isn’t a scam
1615206421,Bruh it’s a fake endorsement
1615206430,bot?
1615206447,If I put endorsed by Coca Cola in my discord name I guess I must be legit

1615208877,Sure!
1615208908,For what? ENJ?
1615209164,The graph is missing some crucial information indeed
1615209547,@Jeremyfto what do you think of this strat lawd
1615209557,i was having the +100% point on 1660 $ of ETH
1615209561,How so?
1615209566,felt like we got enough support going up rn
1615209584,"so i put a bit more, and now +100% is around 1710, which i think can hold its line"
1615209603,so i might be grinding off the +100% bih trying this thing
1615209650,"started the whole move at 85€, so when we finish i'll calc the whole profit %"
1615210842,Let's see if it goes below 1.60
1615212059,Rebought 3 times
1615212065,It can go up again now
1615212078,Didn’t hit my fourth order
1615212200,what you guys think of celr?
1615212737,Nope. Support is at 1.61
1615212780,litecoin update will be on day 15?
1615213216,"I can’t recommend taking a bigger position in ETH. I can only say what I am doing which is ALSO increasing my position size but at the 1800$ mark. I shall be taking 50% of my margin at the 1800$ mark which is a whopping 500 USDT and buy an additional 3.2 ETH for the final push which will put me at 11.7 ETH or 21,060 USDT worth of ETH"
1615213273,UP UP AND AWAY!!!!
1615213277,"ENJ clearly has potential and will rise to a much higher level than today, but will it do a dip first? 👀 The fomo is real"
1615213301,Somebody put in a large buy order lol
1615213316,No dip today. Mostly tomorrow
1615213322,I'd wait to buy in
1615213447,"Oh wait, no dip today from my time. You should check the state when japan wakes up. Might dip then or moon then"
1615213590,Now that's what I call a horoscope 😁
1615213621,No seriously. I will either dip or moon. Some action WILL happen
1615213631,As oposed to walking silently
1615213634,I'd even add that it could also stay stable
1615213638,It's a 100% correct prediction
1615213638,Which is also an action
1615213643,It will NOT stay stable
1615213656,"By the powers of bog, it will stay stable"
1615213661,"possible, but unlikely with all the craze around this coin"
1615213675,By the powers of watching this damn thing for the last week at night. It will not be stable
1615213697,Could the last week just be a sleep-deprivation hallucination?
1615213730,"I wasnt meaning recommending or so, im just saying the strat im taking just like you"
1615213745,Yours is more... Abrupt or some like that i should say
1615213749,Im scalating slowly
1615213756,Impossible. I also barely sleep and see the same
1615213762,Yes. But everything i dream was real in the morning
1615213781,Yay! Sleep buddies. Lets share a nightmare together!
1615213788,Call Kanye
1615213789,"Hmm shared unconsciousness, welcome to limbo guys"
1615213810,Dont gay it up
1615213834,I was thinking about inception
1615213840,"But sure, have it your way 😛"
1615213851,I have no interest in anyone's 'limbo'
1615213916,Im ready to see the 2k pearly gates my friend
1615213969,Hopefully today we can break our current resistance and get to 1800
1615213989,"Ok, so i have a feeling this is the lowest ENJ is every going to be from now on."
1615214003,"By the way, what should I do with ETH and BETH?"
1615214011,BETH being the Binance staking of ETH
1615214017,"When the japan dip happens, it should fall back to this level again. And go up steeply. Window of maybe 10 mins"
1615214026,CHZ and ENJ are doing a collab on collectible that’s why both are going up
1615214031,For 1800 i might wait till 1870 to be sure we broke it
1615214050,Yes.
1615214052,Both are scams
1615214067,"Staking is always great for long term but you can get more profits instead of staking, utilizing futures with leverage"
1615214074,But CHZ is going up because of ENJ.
1615214103,I'm already losing enough money without futures 😛
1615214160,Futures is really powerful when you know what you are doing. Im up 150% on a 1200 USDT position I opened friday
1615214182,Staking is safer though
1615214187,Heh i was on 85€ on binance after this dip
1615214189,The problem is clearly described in your sentence : when you know what you are doing 😂
1615214192,Back again to 130€
1615214200,The rest is wholely staked
1615214294,"I can’t think of futures rn, although could do minimal amount to increase for the sake of getting slowly over the emotional side"
1615214312,And learning more
1615214582,is it a bad sign Algo hasn't really popped in a mass adoption way? seems like something that would have either been huge right away or not at all but im also noob/still learning 😅
1615214970,SwissBorg over 1 € 👌🏻
1615215237,Nxs on the rise
1615215388,"I wouldn't exactly call three 15m candles ""support"", but it is indeed continuing the trend up"
1615215440,"This is not typical support like you are familiar with. It is usage support, not buy support. Every NFT that is bought, every game played. This is what we've been saying"
1615215598,"Okay... granted. Why would people playing games and buying NFTs keep it above any specific price level? It would make more sense to say ""there's still buying pressure from all the usage"" than invent a term like ""usage support"".
But that's just me, focussing more on technicals than fundamentals."
1615215825,"No one in buying or playing to keep it above a price level. This is usage. 

Example, i have made a game and servers are hosted on Amazon. Now i need o budget in server costs as player count increases. How do i do this? Using exactly the line that you see in ENJ. 

I speak from experience www.entersurrogate.com"
1615215922,Website's under update btw
1615216780,idk about focusing on fundamentals during the bull run
1615216794,isnt that something u do during the bear market
1615216811,but love the enthusiasm for enj truly
1615217826,Me to myself. Dont fomo into enj dont fomo into enj
1615218617,Rule of thumb. Always trust paper hands when he puts all in money in one coin and leaves it alone for the very first time in life
1615219084,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJx6afTnD-M
@SeineJanie This explains it better"
1615219365,Is it a good time to buy enj right now? Or should I wait for it to settle and buy the possible dip?
1615220558,I would wait if it’s for longer term
1615220612,Short term / scalping you could take a stab at it :p
1615220778,hmm yeah you're right
1615220968,DO NOT do this. I've lost a lot doing this with ENJ. Its not as predictable as you might think
1615221057,"Also, be aware, one more down trend for the next hour, and then its to the moon. So be careful if you're scalping"
1615221076,:kekw:
1615221080,Better safe than sorry
1615221105,I’m happy with some less profit if it involves less risk 🙂
1615221135,NAV is doing some shit
1615221136,I wasnt. And i suffered for it. DAMMIT! Why didnt i listen to Dazz
1615221152,That shit aint big enough for the big man
1615221154,What happened to Daz
1615221175,"206,920 orders for 871, hoping it goes up so I can take a nice 12% or so"
1615221210,Kayne didn’t respect him
1615221406,"oh yeah!
`NAV: New peak at 897 sats! Gained 5.16% from entry @ 853 sats`"
1615221451,"But MDA is performing best of all the possible pumpcoins I bought today:
`MDA: New peak at 2401 sats! Gained 26.90% from entry @ 1892 sats`"
1615221839,Is that actually a valuable strategy?
1615221914,Yeah someone I follow on twitter was talking about it yesterday
1615221933,I was up 20% the last week scalping pump coins
1615221961,Damn
1615221999,Replicating it week over week? May be a bit more difficult lol but I'm trying.
1615222009,"what, buying all the possible pump coins days in advance and then dump them when they're pumped?"
1615222023,Dump before the pump 😉
1615222037,@\MeeM/ That's what got me most profits. 300% on MDA and ~~117% (iirc)~~ 135% on GVT
1615222057,Buying in on coins after they're pumped
1615222097,"What's dumps around, pumps around."
1615222127,They're usually relatively cheap after a pump'n'dump. Because people will sell way too low.
1615222143,Sell the hype buy the fear baby
1615222203,"I did that on SKY after it got pumped, but sold it way too early 😫"
1615222239,All about securing the profits
1615222294,You will always be too early or too late
1615222473,Kinda
1615222500,"I feel it’s always , I sell it keeps pumping"
1615222506,"I keep it, dump"
1615222508,I guess you're always better save than sorry
1615222592,"*Thinks about buying... Doesn't do it*
-Coin goes up 

*Thinks about buying... Buys in*
-Coin dumps"
1615222668,Hey can you just let me know when you buy and sell? So I can do the opposite? Lol
1615222700,If you Wanne buy into a green candle Sure
1615222705,Not recommended :p
1615222923,Changpeng Zhao sold his tweet as NFT lol
1615223013,We're working on a signals platform specifically designed to let you know when to buy/sell.
1615223170,I hope you are specifically designing it to only give sell signals for Doge 😂
1615223243,Doge gets the special conditional
1615223260,🐶
1615223272,"If coin.name === ""DOGE"":
signal = ""SELL"""
1615223281,Ye can code
1615223324,Yep! Its a part of my job even though Im not a dev
1615223337,Glad im not a dev tho. I think it would ruin programming
1615223350,doing it all day every day as a job seems like it would really make it get old
1615223370,"If it's part of your job, then what does that make you?"
1615223426,I'm an IT Analyst as far as titles go. My company is a medium sized company(20 pizza locations plus 1 corp office) but I am 50% of our entire IT department. My boss being the other 50%
1615223476,Much wow
1615223489,We use a lot of third party stuff though so most of the coding is just integrating APIs to work together as well as working on our main landing page hub that displays most of the info received from the apis
1615223508,"Yeah, so you're a dev unfortunately, lmao"
1615223529,Kinda although I have to do the hardware side of things as well so it keeps it fresh
1615223558,only thing I am glad about is we contract out the hard manual labor like pulling lines and installing racks
1615223583,I primarily just do printers and POS installs while diagnosing and repairing some of the larger equipment.
1615223705,"Fock ENJ, CHSB🚀🚀🚀🚀money maker with only one token fock the market and all the TA 🚨🚨"
1615223736,Are we still HODLing MLK 😂
1615223744,I am waiting for the second wave
1615223749,😂
1615223769,Seriously CHSB just announced the community premium
1615223775,And pumped
1615223783,This token is crazy
1615223817,Im so ready for ETH to hit 2k so I can get out and open up positions in some of these fun tokens
1615223829,CHSB sounds great and I def want to get some DOT action
1615223846,Also plan on taking advantage of the SKY reoccuring pumps 😂
1615223852,CHSB is crypto wealth management project so expectation gonna be crazy
1615223865,I am also on ETH for the principe
1615223916,When ETH hits 2k I will have 7200 USDT and plan on putting 2k into a 2x ETH leverage position to just sit there for a while and use 2k for spot trading some of these fun coins
1615223934,Guys theres someone dm'ed me and says
1615223957,it says i won in the give away from cryptocrrency
1615223969,Congratz man
1615223970,2k is going into the stock market and the last 1200 will go to get me a 3d printer and chill in a savings account
1615223974,I am near 50k+ and could be near 60k if chsb continue
1615223979,"Unless it's going to $3 within 10 hrs like ENJ, I'm seeling all my CHSB for ENJ now."
1615223986,But i dont leverage
1615223996,😂😂
1615224021,Thats quite a bit! I had 0 savings before crypto. Crypto has really helped me save a ton and now I am making good money off it to top it off
1615224032,goal is 30k by EOTY so I can get a tesla
1615224044,I admit crypto is@crazy
1615224050,Should i send screen shot of it?
1615224062,Especially if you re in since a while
1615224074,You should send a screen shot to #🍆frat-chat and tag one of the admin roles so they can get banned
1615224087,oke
1615224131,"Move to Belgium, get a company car and save that 30k for more profits"
1615224135,But my experience is that holding is better than trading when you are not able to build a strat
1615224151,Its a scam
1615224165,ow
1615224183,You will get a bunch of spam dm if you chill into crypto discord ^^
1615224193,Lmao i dont know how to use it😅
1615224197,Ya that is what I have seen as well. If I got out of ETH quickly I would have made 300$ but now Im at +2000$ for holding over the weekend
1615224204,"I have some gems for which if they reach my target from now to next year, i will be millionnaire"
1615224219,👍🏽
1615224221,You mean DOGE?
1615224235,i have 5 dms here
1615224242,from crypto currency
1615224253,Well if they tell you won a price just block them
1615224262,Ow oke
1615224269,Im not really aiming for millionaire status quite yet. I want to get the house and dream car situated first before I start building my dragon horde
1615224306,Sure they are material things that will not gain much value or lose value in the car side of things but they are what I WANT right now
1615224365,You right and thats why i have multiple strat.
1615224411,which is the way to go. Diversification. Unfortunately not all good coins make it but diversification removes a lot of that risk
1615224422,"I'm on the way to make my first 1k with crypto
Everybody starts somewhere, right?"
1615224449,For sure! All profits are good profits. Any day you are in the green is a W my friend
1615224474,Might go heavy into ENJ
1615224483,"green days aren't guaranteed and we all have red days. Regardless of the shade of green, its always good to be thankful for it"
1615224490,Crypto has already paid off for me
1615224513,You should just go super heavy on ETH and push it to 2k today 😉
1615224521,First days made me so nervous I started working out for compensation. +8 pounds of muscles so far
1615224531,I just need you to put a few billion in so I can get out. Pretty pretty please 🙂
1615224591,I still get nervous to this day. I am currently holding a position with profits more than two weeks of my salary because right now we arent at my target take profits price. It freaks me out if I look at it too long
1615224615,"It seems the more green my positions get, the more nervous I get holding them"
1615224625,Ikr?
1615224708,The day I enter futures market will be the day I run a 20 mile marathon
1615224719,I am actually taking a week off trading after I hit my target sell goal. Its very hard on my mental state and I think a week to refresh with no open positions will do me some good
1615224774,futures is great profit but it comes with great levels of stress if you aren't used to it and I personally am too new at it to not be nervous. Iv been doing it long enough to know how to do it but not long enough to be ok with seeing big profit numbers
1615224782,red days are actually less stressful for me 😂
1615224833,Green positions make you wanna stare at it for the whole day
1615224842,Reds you just wanna ignore I guess
1615224865,Thats probably accurate. I feel like I am doing a lot more staring now then when I was -250$ PNL
1615224939,"I decided I will see the trade to completion though. Im not going to get anywhere from changing my plan based off stress . I wanted to get out at the +100% area and now that I have stayed in, im at +160%"
1615224974,"But if eth would dump tonight, then you are also more quickly down I guess right?"
1615224981,How do you sleep at night :p
1615224999,with one eye staring at my position 😉
1615225030,Nah Im not too nervous about it dipping. I got in based on my analysis of the ETH market and we are getting further and further away from my liq point
1615225050,losing it all doesnt stress me out. Its more stressing not to take my profits and run
1615225061,Its like seeing a candy bar that you really want but can't have
1615225096,I know the risk and am not afraid of those risk not panning out in my favor. Its just seeing something that I want to take RIGHT NOW thats stressing me out
1615225477,Who pumped nebl?
1615226208,I trade cryptocurrencies and leverage on the market's volatility. What market are you affiliated with?
1615226269,Sorry I don’t understand your sentence

1615231229,Thoughts on Btc? Do you guys think it will break 52k?

1615231329,@That one belgian super cunt they want to add more coin and provide their client the possibility to have advice on their crypto portfolio
1615231345,It means that they will make money for you
1615231374,So i will not be surprised end of year reach 3$ maybe 5$
1615231385,👀
1615231394,Some are predicting 20$ but i dont believe
1615231398,But who knows
1615231401,I do have to admit. Their exchange was smooooth

1615234993,course
1615234997,Thats exactly what they do
1615234998,id do it
1615235003,without hesitation

1615235019,Most tubers are greedy incels
1615235021,regardless of the market conditions
1615235041,I was listening to a dude talking about how ETH is going to 16k by EOTY
1615235064,I like ETH and I believe in it going up a decent amount this year but saying 16k is way out there
1615235066,My mom said that also
1615235094,I only watch that guy with the receding hairline lol
1615235111,"I can see 5k, MAYBE towards 10k if 2.0 comes out this summer but saying shit like ""Its going to 16k by EOTY"" is misleading your audience"
1615235129,I was thinking 4-5k
1615235131,Even 5k would be huge
1615235132,And that is why I do not go off content creators
1615235152,They are way too bullish and have way too much bias
1615235196,Instead of a sell order putting in a buy order
1615235197,Sigh

1615235519,"Most of the time when margin is allowed, it is a larger exchange and larger exchanges normally dont hold small coins"
1615235545,"In addition to that, margin is a loan and I wouldnt trust a platform that had small coins AND gave out loans"
1615235559,man what if we hodl till 16k

1615235595,but i will re add things to it so....
1615235604,Ill give you an extra 1k for HODLing with me that long 😂
1615235613,Hmm why would it be so bad if they would have margin for small coins?
1615235619,deal :godsgardener:
1615235637,Yea I only found margin for bigger exchanges sadly :/
1615235659,"Because like I said, mainly bigger platforms have margin and bigger platforms dont have small coins. Margins are loans and you dont want to take a loan from a small ass exchange"
1615235687,Thats how you A. get your money stolen or B. end up paying ridiculous interest rates. Possibly even going into debt
1615235696,Oh gotcha
1615235735,Just like you wouldnt go to one of the places that says LOANS on the business sign. The smaller the operation the higher the chance of it being sketch
1615235766,"I believe I have a really good idea, which I wouldnt like to share in public, that could make me a lot of profit with relatively small risk. But I need to margin trade small coins for that, and as it looks like its not really possible anywhere"
1615235804,However if anyone can provide me with some good info that solves the problem I am willing to cut in the person 🙂
1615235814,true
1615236302,would the idea happen to be taking out a margin position and then forcing the price up with a self sustained pump
1615236320,nope
1615236324,good
1615236328,coz that would be bad
1615236366,"I dont think that would be even possible, I would need to put multiple 100ks or even more as colletaral 😄"
1615236373,yup
1615236405,maybe you'll be able to do that
1615236407,but man
1615236418,didnt you learn something about the wolf of wall street?
1615236451,that shady shit on the crypto market wont go punished because its not regulated?
1615236455,I am not sure if crpyto is legally already regulated
1615236458,exactly
1615236478,the problem is that you would need to take a massive risk for a small profit % wise
1615236507,not really smart
1615236555,"my idea involves small risk with a solid profit, but I can basicly throw it out the window if I can´t margin trade the coins"
1615236574,binance would have margin trading for some small coins id think
1615236583,hmm yes
1615236591,but that doing that is bad
1615236601,yea i know
1615236608,my last idea is to check bots like 3commas which can operate through all brokers
1615236615,sadly not the ones I am looking for
1615236679,lmfaooooooo
1615236730,Wtf. What???
1615236746,Enj?
1615237140,@Cryptoknight u heavy into enj?
1615237149,100%
1615237158,whats ur target
1615237180,"Will sell 50% when its $7, and the rest i keep forever. I see it going to atleast $100"
1615237189,Got into enj at 0.4😏
1615237197,Lucky bastard
1615237205,"Actually, smart bastard"
1615237233,$100 is more of a end of year 2022 sort of goal
1615237277,"I should have never doubted ENJ when i entered at 0.69  sold at 0.85
Last entry is at 1.25"
1615237293,Its ok. Just entered with another 2K at 1.7
1615237311,Oof
1615237315,Too risky
1615237347,Damn you are damn certain of this coin
1615237348,"I'm not feeling the risk to be honest. I've seen the project, and its far more functional than even bitcoin"
1615237375,Same is being told about ADA yet it kinda stalled
1615237386,Some coins that are good to buy right now?
1615237399,ENJ
1615237407,Already got some
1615237407,But ADA is still 'work-in-progress'. ENJ is already in use
1615237431,Work in progress? For how many years already
1615237440,Enj is panjeet scam
1615237452,Lukso > ENJ
1615237478,Lukso EOM $30
1615237483,2 blocked messages. You know what that means!
1615237499,You haven’t blocked me dude
1615237512,Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to react to your messages
1615237536,Lukso was like $1.20 6 weeks ago
1615237539,It’s now $20
1615237542,Cant find lukso on binance
1615237555,It’s on uniswap
1615237560,"But thats the whole point right? How long. Some time back, people were saying that ADA is a scam too"
1615237633,"Someone says that ENJ is a scam, its easy to go LOL now because its already in use. ADA is not really in use right now. No system is dependant on it yet."
1615237654,Maybe @SeineJanie can correct me if im wrong
1615237675,Huh?
1615237688,Where did this come from?
1615237738,Lukso probably $140 by end of year or at least by q2 2022
1615237763,It’s parabolic so buy on the dip
1615237782,what do you think about Cardano and IOTA?
1615237795,what do you think about Cardano and IOTA?
1615237817,ADA is good. Iota not so much
1615237831,Whats the downside of it?
1615237859,Iota is just ripple 2.0
1615237896,Kucoin
1615237941,oh
1615238080,All in pros btw?
1615238129,Bitcoin is moving like an old lady. Wish I had put more in young ETH...
1615238152,Was very solid 2 wks ago before the great dump. And is somewhat low right now
1615238335,depend on which old lady :godsgardener:
1615238400,"ADA is in use. People are building stuff with it, smart contracts and whatnot. Don't know exactly but it's definitely in use.
Not as sexy as buying NFTs with ENJ of course."
1615238423,"missed the ENJ boat, still worth getting in?"
1615238431,or not at this price
1615238567,you'll likely get a lot of mixed answers on that question
1615238611,eh yeah
1615238620,i might wait for a correction before hopping in
1615238623,I think it’s gonna dip again first
1615238702,Extremely unlikely. It might dip after $3 but that will also be above its current price. That's where I plan on going 2x
1615238725,How much money has to flow in before that happens?
1615238728,"Oh, didn't know that."
1615238769,Won't matter. It's not about people buying. It's about people using the apps that uses enj
1615238798,That’s not an answer :p
1615238800,"It would basically be consolidating to its actual value, which is significantly higher than the current value"
1615238874,The value currently is driving up also because people are buy nfts and other stuff with it.so it's gaining value without people actually meaning to buy into it as well.
1615239008,of topic.. Ocean protocol.  is it worth to buy now and leave it for some time??))
1615239017,idk.. it just went from a few hundred mil cap to 1.5 bil cap
1615239028,enj btw
1615239058,And it will rise fast. Mostlikely when japan wakens up again
1615239078,It's going to be pearl harbour tonight
1615239134,"I like your confidence @Cryptoknight, but also a little worried that you're betting it all on one coin."
1615239165,"That's not to say ENJ won't make another big move and reach $3 as soon as tonight, but you can't be that certain in its longevity"
1615239229,To double it tonight would need a insane amount of cash no?
1615239242,Or am I seeing that wrong
1615239260,"It kinda reminds me of that initial ADA hype period where it was gonna beat ETH by March 1st and reach 2 or 3 dollars and never stop climbing, it was the biggest bet and hype train. Same with doge. they've all consolidated."
1615239284,"Wait, ADA didn't beat ETH?!?"
1615239285,1.5 bil to 3 bil valuations
1615239289,seems impossible to me...
1615239295,🤯
1615239322,shocking right?
1615239325,lulul
1615239341,Im super duper shocked. I dont know what to do with myself
1615239397,ATOM looks ready again for a wave up
1615239538,Why the hell does ADA keep going down ffs
1615239561,so it can shoot up again lol
1615239589,To give me a good buy in spot
1615239605,https://tenor.com/view/lets-go-come-on-red-carpet-this-is-us-this-is-us-gifs-gif-9668895
1615239628,it will clime up i hold my ADA. time will cover it all.
1615239635,"mean while anyone here holds Voyager Token
?:)"
1615239674,I just want ADA to climb like my girl LUNA has 😭
1615239881,Perfect time to buy. It hasn’t gone below 70% of its ATH which is brilliant. People just being impatient
1615239931,If you wanna make a quick little buck atm. BTC is looking good. So far it has followed my prediction for today. It's correcting a little atm now
1615239969,going down?
1615239978,man it went straight to 1.03 a few days ago
1615239982,its correcting
1615239987,or already did i think
1615240026,Looking at btc pairing I assume
1615240063,"85k USD bitcoin by May, 66% return"
1615240079,I know but I am talking about today 😛
1615240095,this morning I said 8% up. Currently at 5% up
1615240111,ah didnt see the msg
1615240163,but yeah i have been preparing for BTC and ETH to rocket in the long run
1615240550,CHZ doing well again
1615240954,Are there any crypto trading sites that give you an actual wallet?
1615240960,Great as I got some more 😛
1615241225,In CBSH We trust lol  I do at least:)
1615241285,"will wait for it doble,  sale half, get my money back and leave the rest down there to ripe to what ever u will grow to Yeilding.  my plan at least. same with Ada really but not selling on  half 🙂"
1615241323,Lol I confused it with CBSH but my statment stands:) it also going up
1615241499,Absolutely. Things will change and we change with them.
1615241810,live is in motion!:)
1615241818,u snooze u lose 🙂
1615244107,How do people feel about dyor.net
1615244111,anyone use it successfully?
1615244399,ENJ off to the moon
1615244485,Damn I’m loving my VET position rn
1615244530,This
1615244545,I bought at 2 cents
1615244556,My only regret is it didn’t wait until Friday so I could dump more into it
1615244560,Gotta be a typo
1615244569,.20 and I’d be hood rich.
1615244591,Half my bag is at .01 and the other half is at .03
1615244601,So I guess I’m at .02 with you lol
1615244603,Green green green
1615244612,Everything else is red for me
1615244614,😪😭
1615244882,Swissborg covers some of my reds. So I’m not panicking but seeing geeen in more then one position is soothing lol
1615244888,We just need to wait
1615244928,yo

1615245509,buy and hold
1615245591,ouhh idk man

1615245635,i made enough TA to jump in i mean
1615245666,im testing a new strat on my first futures contract
1615245687,dont know if its worth the risk jumpin in right now with other strat
1615245692,depends on you
1615245704,And whaf after 2k? Deep? Correction ?

1615245729,keep everything in mid positions and bye bya
1615245732,🙂
1615245744,Que bien!
1615245750,Good plan
1615245828,after the next test or support i might throw a lil bag more
1615245837,removing from margin and throwing it in
1615245837,"My plan when I take time off: 60% of the bag on stablecoin, pick a few of the more peaceful coins, and put a bot to work on them with stop loss in place"
1615245838,Cool
1615246111,SEND ME MONEY FOR MY DIAMOND CALL ON CHSB 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚀🚀🚀
1615246112,SLP ON FIREEE
1615246113,
1615246146,"SLP, ETH etc all@bullshit CHSB all bullish"
1615246510,@Capet2 thx for the call
1615246522,Made some nice percents
1615246780,m'lawd @Jeremyfto if we get 2k i think i'll have made 2.8x
1615246823,"made calcs, atm i have put 88 $ into, but first entry has been 40"
1615246830,so its paying itself
1615246840,I did what I said I was going to do
1615246846,I halfed my leverage and bought more ETH
1615246850,I own 11.103 ETH now
1615246854,halved?
1615246863,you closed the position you mean
1615246865,Yep! My removable leverage was 900ish
1615246870,I removed 450
1615246877,oh your margin
1615246880,not the leverage
1615246884,Oh shit I mispoke
1615246889,yeah hahaha nvm
1615246890,Sorry I am like really hyped rn
1615246891,lol
1615246894,"at ETH 2k 5,592.46 will be my balance USDT 😍 my heart is literally racing. This is such a rush"
1615246898,im keeping the same position till i get 2k
1615246911,that will look awesome in my account
1615246924,a good ol' ride of an uptrend at 12x
1615246934,shoulda futures as well
1615246939,Instead i just held from 1.5k
1615246950,https://tenor.com/view/weirdchamping-weirdchamp-twitch-meme-ryan-gutierrez-gif-17202815
1615246958,first learn about it
1615246966,its risky but if you know how to control it
1615246967,
1615246974,ROE doesnt match actual ROE
1615246979,you become a fucking Neo dodging bullets
1615246984,Cause I used margin to add to position
1615246988,yeah mine does not too
1615247027,Im 1000 USD off 4x squad so hopefully at 1900 ill be at 4x squad
1615247029,"i think i could have put more into it, because i always had a liq price 400$ below current"
1615247047,"which, is really conservative and safe, but first times cant be perfect they say :godsgardener:"
1615247051,My liq price as 1404 today. Now its 1504
1615247072,Im ok with a 100$ increase on liq for some extra bucks at the finish line
1615247074,mines 1496
1615247086,whats your current avg entry price?
1615247093,1670 i think lemme check
1615247115,i realised that what is changed when you move leverage up or add to position is the entry price
1615247117,nothing else
1615247118,Iv kept mine low since i bought most of my ETH at base. Im at 1586.31
1615247135,1665
1615247151,If we hit 1900 today that would be mega insane
1615247159,i put like +50% at position today and yesterday night
1615247174,and i will use most of the margin when we get above 1950
1615247242,I will be honest I did not expect it to break the 1800 barrier so effortlessly
1615247254,I seriously expected it to have to wait till tomorrow to get a break that stuck
1615247264,yeah i was here like ok lets try again tomorrow nice try people
1615247265,I figured we would enter 1800 today but I didnt think we would break in
1615247274,and just after dinner boom
1615247284,https://tenor.com/view/tommy-goodfellas-bottoms-up-gif-15887626
1615247307,Road to 2k squad
1615247368,Are you gonna take out all your margin
1615247497,not of as yet
1615247529,^^
1615247551,That’s what I was thinking
1615247554,Last push
1615247573,lawd jeremy went more stair-like when adding position funds
1615247581,lemme check my history and you see it
1615247620,"1528 (first 4x then 12x), 1537, 1530, 1747, 1786, 1819"
1615247622,I would love to say I’m willing to stay in beyond 2k but I think I just wanna quit there
1615247635,Gonna be a tough call
1615247636,kinda more spread
1615247648,wee i dont know
1615247655,if it happens like 1.8k like right now
1615247663,"that we move above it, then move a bit more"
1615247676,might stay till 2050-2100 close
1615247687,"because, well... im at 12x"
1615247690,I’m optimistic for an ATH but
1615247695,a single 1% is a damn 12% for me
1615247699,I shall be happy closing at 2k
1615247709,I’m in at 40x lmao
1615247905,https://tenor.com/view/chad-gif-18294082
1615247934,Ok so
1615247942,Being relatively new to futures
1615247983,Say we break 2k and we’re doing what’s happening now like loitering at 1830ish
1615247993,So say it’s like 2030
1615247998,well anything above 15-20x for me is fucking risky
1615248006,i hope you know what you are doing
1615248013,and keep the liq away
1615248019,I got in at 1485
1615248056,How much money did you put in?
1615248067,1200 USDT 👀
1615248071,oh so you just moved up the leverage
1615248073,12x
1615248116,Yeah I started at 20x though and I don’t really know what’s happened but it’s working
1615248137,Damn
1615248143,uh
1615248153,"might work for you this time, but gotta read about this"
1615248161,could not be so lucky next position
1615248196,We’re not talking mega money dude
1615248251,"My liq is still fairly low, I’m quite comfortable"
1615248345,"well yeah i dont know how much you pouring in, but still, i think risking too much any amount is to be bold"
1615248356,"if you get it right, good for you"
1615248359,Purely Vegas approach with this one
1615248412,If I lose it I can still eat and live and pay my bills and have coin in wallets elsewhere
1615248492,yeah its good
1615248504,im not used to other people putting small bags (for them)
1615248529,"i put here all my bank acc which i wasnt using, because pandemic, not buying anything big, eth"
1615248543,and living with parents yet
1615248571,so its weird i'm putting a big percentage for me but its tiny for you all
1615248571,This is more a test for me if I can hack the scene by putting money on something and not touching it for more than 24 hours
1615248601,"who got jobs, some are older, swiss might be bugging me but could be millionaire 🤣"
1615248619,Yeah I get you
1615248628,im the small fish here
1615248629,Well we’re all in this together now so off we go to 2k
1615248706,"I’m probably small compared to a lot of people here, but I don’t like to talk actual numbers"
1615248714,Each to his own
1615248717,yeah
1615248743,"if you can put 10, play it smart, if you put 10k or 50k, you have more room to play it differently"
1615248744,I know that if I lose what I’ve put in then I can still live and eat
1615248756,Could be $10 for all you know 😉
1615249004,Wouldn't sleep a single minute with an open 50k position
1615249062,I did a very quick 125x short on BTC when it took a dip and it required a level of concentration I don’t think I can keep up
1615249779,If VET hits .10 this week I’ll name my firstborn child VeChain
1615249806,stg
1615249814,YES
1615249819,ETH RETESTING 1810
1615249855,ETH is an old man coin
1615249859,Slow and lots of gas
1615249975,no

1615272282,This could be from the beurax scam that has just happened 😱😱
1615272301,
1615272330,them cashing out?
1615272337,This was a compounding platform that had issues at the start of the month then all of a sudden the website closed down
1615272348,Looks that way
1615272412,I only had £1500 in there but I know people that have/had over £80k there
1615272640,but still 995 btc
1615272650,that is aLOT of money
1615272717,but yeah i sold half of my btc don't think it will be reaching 55k this run
1615272769,will probably correct to 52 maybe 50k
1615272834,what bro
1615272850,who's taking 995 btc that they stole and putting it on a public exchange
1615272851,😂

1615273739,ADA the only one kind of limping but we got so much growth from it recently I aint even mad
1615273760,Great time to be alive
1615273978,Opinions on CHZ?
1615274037,was watching a streamer last night who said not enough history for the long run iirc
1615274082,I’ve made some nice coin on it today lol.
1615274126,wait wat its 100% up. Nice!
1615274151,I only made about 30% of that but still happy!
1615274178,Can we steal EA sports' motto
1615274184,"Crypto, It's in the game"
1615274202,wait not game
1615274203,"No, because EA should never be emulated"
1615274204,gain
1615274213,"Crypto, It's in the GAINZ"
1615274262,cringe but fitting
1615274352,shill me some altcoins pleaase
1615274562,CHZ seems to be pushing hard at the moment. Lots of volume. Could be a good minor money maker in the next few hours if you watch it
1615274839,Seems to at least dip a bit
1615275145,I think ENJ is trying to get support at the current higher levels atm maybe it won't go down?
1615275324,Just broke through 29c just then. Probably missed the short term money making oppo
1615275337,16% on VIB today
1615275338,notbadnotbad
1615275352,bag from 3wks ago finally payin off
1615275393,ouch
1615275455,@seven eleven personally I am using stop limit orders conservatively for CHZ but still buying high yeah
1615275484,I might just hold for now aye. This shit is going nuts
1615275510,will we hit 0.3
1615275516,Afraid to buy in rn
1615275530,"next time in Cryptotrading
more drama
more gainz
less losses
more doge"
1615275538,Dont wanna kill your profits by dragging the course down
1615275556,More Doge 🙏
1615275560,Each night I think ENJ Will drop so I can buy in
1615275566,If it gets through 30c it could go to 33c pretty quick
1615275567,same lmao
1615275567,Nope denied :’)
1615275651,btw BTC is a good selling time atm
1615275656,well kinda already missed the peak
1615275672,Its crypto so who knows :p
1615275677,Not selling btc rn
1615275684,Could be just pushing to 60k
1615275691,It's going up well
1615275695,"I think it will go down another time to 52000 for now, then tomorrow/wednesday probs back to 54800ish"
1615275719,at least that is what I am betting on 😛
1615275739,Think I'll wait till 65-70k and sell hoping for a dip
1615276106,Crazy things going on
1615276109,
1615276124,"CHZ, how low can you go?
Just did a margin sell at 536 sats for some quick profit 😏"
1615276171,NFT craze
1615276182,If only someone had predicted it ...
1615276227,Waiting for someone else to get credited with the prediction lol
1615276277,"Swiss did, kinda: https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/813341191071727636"
1615276566,I’d say that counts
1615277229,"I rec'd this to a colleague 3 weeks ago at $0.03, did't take my own advice though 🤯"
1615277318,Dang ... I messed up the decimals and only got 200 free CHZ from my 5x margin sell. 😄 🤦🏼‍♂️
1615277703,The fact it’s ass hasn’t fallen out is a good sign
1615278149,😩 maybe I should fall for the FOMO
1615278296,AVA to $3 before ENJ 👌🏼
1615278338,:virgin:
1615278603,How about ADA to $3 please
1615278604,For me
1615278616,yes pls
1615278793,Would enjoy this muchly
1615279030,What’s a hood coin that’s dipped
1615279110,"ADA will eventually get there, I have no doubts there"
1615279122,Not sure how long it'll take but it will
1615279145,Monetha 🤤🤤
1615279160,Everything is sky high at the moment
1615279262,Monetha/MTH 🤤🤤 ez pump has low market cap
1615279442,Lol looks so sad
1615279664,we don't do pumps
1615279680,I’m confused
1615279730,Where pump then?
1615279856,go to one of the scam groups like WSB crypto and such. P&Ds are scams. we are a place where victims of these scams met and we do proper education and signals. made way more money than any PND could ever give me.
1615280177,@SeineJanie its about time lit does something
1615280220,LegIT
1615280477,don't know how much I might put in. maybe the good old 100 bucks to thread the waters
1615280760,sounds reasonable
1615281362,"P&Ds might make you some quick bucks (if ur lucky) but if you wanna have real gains, you better start investing  ""normally"""
1615281925,Is BNB starting to cop a heap of volume now?
1615281941,Got my 250 and 260 alerts within 5-10mins of each other
1615281988,BNB gaining without BTC leading is a very good sign I'd say
1615282547,Damn BNB where are you going
1615282617,Bnb is gaining because i was planning to buy some today  :kekw:
1615282864,I was again looking at SKY thinking now I should buy some
1615282868,and I never do
1615282871,and it always pumps
1615282872,:p
1615282877,sky always wins
1615282884,"buy every dip, always gets me 50-100%"
1615282891,same with pnt
1615282900,with leverage then or?
1615282911,i've just been market buying tbh
1615282919,Sky makes some moves
1615282923,but not 100% :p
1615282947,3 pretty big pumps in feb
1615282958,got almost 300% on the first
1615282972,I see
1615282981,Yeah but how long do u usually wait till they pump it?
1615282983,Weeks?
1615282987,I just need 2% a day
1615282991,thats the target 😂
1615283001,i have bags of $250 in like 15 shitcoins
1615283007,just sitting there waiting with sell orders
1615283040,I was doing 5 to 7% a day untill fucking market went bananas
1615283066,I just take 2% move back into stable coin

1615283117,todays been a good day so far lmao
1615283137,main bags in ADA/ETH/BTC
1615283303,Anybody got COTI ?  Think PayPal but without big fees it will allow companies to offer you the chance to pay for something on their website with your crypto.  Might be a good hold whilst the whole world wakes up and starts trusting Crypto as their currency; kind of like the period 2001-2005 when people woke up to parting with their money to buy things online
1615283397,Holy shit
1615283410,When did btc get to 54k 💀💀
1615283430,the moment I was in stablecoin expecting a correction
1615283440,I did it for the team; you are welcome
1615284027,🌶 🌶 🌶
1615284039,Whom love the CHZ

1615284585,persistence always wins :kekw:
1615284649,Doenst matter. ENJ is goign to kill BTC soon.
1615284868,ETH to 1950 by the end of today
1615284925,:kekw: :kekw: :kekw: :kekw: :kekw:
1615284939,Uh huh. Sure
1615284969,Why do you think BTC is running so fast now? Its fucking scared. ENJ has a use case thats a billion times more prominent than BTC. It is just a fiat currency now. Fuck BTC
1615285002,Iotas slowly went up 🥸
1615285025,:kekw:
1615285034,Why are we talking about bronze while we are holding gold
1615285037,Man chill.
1615285040,Seriously
1615285047,*shill?
1615285059,(now that i know what that means)
1615285079,"No, don't shill, bro. Chill."
1615285084,"Ok, I ADMIT IT! 

I LOVE ENJ!"
1615285096,Until it collapses
1615285108,Coins like this happened before.
1615285122,Massive growth SUPER USEFUL AMAZING
1615285124,Also
1615285128,The flippining
1615285199,"But it's never gonna collapse, Belgian! Microsoft et al will make sure of it! There's usage support at 1.61 USDT"
1615285255,Thoughts on PHB ?
1615285263,ADA not sucking as much the last 30-40mins
1615285302,madafaka! I just sold my ADAUP
1615285308,2 hrs ago
1615285408,I saw it go up relatively quickly from 1.13 to 1.15 and sold CHZ profits to that
1615285428,Added to staked ADA now
1615285555,"my issue with ADA is that I bought with BTC instead of FIAT so while the $ price is pretty stable, the BTC val is dropping"
1615285807,26 hours left ...
1615285821,can't even surpass $2 rn
1615285928,lmao
1615286086,There has to a reason why ADA is so volatile right now. Hasn’t moved this quickly since the ATH day
1615286180,"should I jump on it, hmmm"
1615286192,KEY looks like it might be setting up for some movement too
1615286217,If you’re looking at short term gain I don’t think so
1615286314,do the opposite of what is mentioned on here.... thats my strategy after my ADA fail :kekw:
1615286338,do the opposite of what I think
1615286348,🤯
1615286382,I re entered ADA at like 2800 BTC pairing
1615286387,not the best move
1615286392,2644 here
1615286398,thank god I cut my losses
1615286418,how much were you down when you cut losses
1615286449,ADA closing on 1.20
1615286452,Exciting
1615286626,BNB outgrowing ENJ
1615286629,This is gonna be a fun period to watch ADA
1615286642,At least for now
1615286672,2500 I think
1615286744,Think there’s a rumour that’s spread or people predicting news for this kind of volatility
1615286762,Because it’s been barely moving recently.
1615287146,Swissboooooorg
1615287178,whats up bitches
1615287219,Oh no ADA ded

1615287771,come on crash BTC
1615287805,also ada had 295 btc worth of buying in less than 15 minutes

1615292826,it is a token running on ETH blockchain right?
1615292877,I've applied to see if they'll accept my little startup
1615292884,I think @Blackhartd
1615292965,👍🏽
1615292979,"i dont know much about token behaviour and dependency on its mother blockchain, but ETH is going up (IMO) as BTC does so, and could hold on just a little while longer"
1615293012,"if you think it won't do that, sell if you feel safe"
1615293661,Do you know when Boson Protocol ICO will be?
1615293685,Was there a minimum amount or was that for private ICO only? I heard like $50k min
1615293992,check their site mate

1615295837,Bitcoin is cuddling with the trend line. Watch out if it goes below.
1615295925,its touching the top of bolly bands
1615296111,Any reason why xlm didn’t go up much after that increase of btc ?
1615296141,on what tf? 4h? It's between middle and upper band on 1h though

1615296202,i hope so
1615296211,"Respect da pump, BTC!"
1615296218,btw i guess we could get eth to 1900 if btc gets closer to 56
1615296233,That would be nice
1615296237,but it had some independent growth away from btc moves
1615296245,so couldnt tell
1615296358,im using those two lines to check possible support zones
1615296381,also both points that make them are not in the pic lmao

1615302221,the market did react to the announcement from 2 weeks ago
1615302262,The fuck happened here then?
1615302274,This is yesterday
1615302292,Something seems very off.
1615302329,This literally looks like railway tracks where the track direction was changed somehow
1615302405,
1615302860,idk 🤣
1615303554,"I would please ask ppl to just 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 when they talk about XRP cuz they are not skilled enough......
News about moneygram was known since while. 
Every crypto noob were expecting a critical dump on feb 21 after first SEC meeting. Nothing happen...... 
so stop trying to understand XRP chart if you dont know XRPL and how it works already around the world.
And dont tell me blablablabla ripple is blablabla i dont give a shit of your shit. If you dont know crypto history stop talking Ripple doesnt own the technology even if they have a lot of coin but at the end whats the pb. It is not a shitcoin for mass ppl it is dedicated to bank and big big big of this world"

1615304880,i should fill up my XRP bags anyway. been meaning to
1615304997,"Dude seriously, the amount of aggression im getting here after the ENJ thing is pissing off. You don't want to buy in, you don't agree, fine, but being a dick about it is simply dumb! I've always respected your opinions, even if i very rarely didn't agree with them. Its a matter of basic decency. So dont go around calling me Kanye, i'm trying very very hard not to be a dick."

1615305282,Lets play a game
1615305287,oh god
1615305309,I think BNB climbing to 400 in the next weeks is more than possible
1615305317,What’s the deal with btc Rn??
1615305322,lets play a game then swiss
1615305342,depending on price in a few years you might be early in BNB right now. 👀
1615305366,its all in perspective
1615305383,"Its ok. You know i love y'all. Not about attacked. Im here to learn, from you and the others. While i learn, i will say things, some may be right, some may be wrong. Discuss. I still feel very firmly by ENJ, and stand firmly next to Dazz, who should have been here right now. He basically rage quit. Whether you were in ENJ before or not is irrelevant."
1615305410,dazz was super spammy though

1615305472,except when I was dealing with kanye
1615305476,Yeah. youre a friendly cunt. Imagine my surprise when you were being a unfriendly dick to dazz. Chad of the week too!
1615305492,That was somehowo supposed to be a compliment
1615305502,I said sorry cuz i agree that ive been to far. But you should now admit that you talked too much about only one coin like insisting crazy and being shilling. Then dazz doesnt need an advocate so now please stop all of this and peace
1615305526,atleast you arent shilling doge. :sausagedestroyer:
1615305533,Im in doge though

ENJ to the earth. 

I dont care about the coin btw. I care about the concept. It its much much stronger than BTC. I know this, and probably have related to it in the way that i have because its operating in the industry that i have expertise with."
1615305625,Naaaaaaaa
1615305660,Cool its important to believe in project i respect that but no need to insist

1615305791,cant even move it because god damn the fees are like 20 bucks
1615305838,u talking about BNB?:)

1615307343,When is coinbase ipo?
1615307438,I dont think it has a official release date yet but ill be honest Im not buying into it. They already sold a shit ton of their shares to the private market(the rich people market) and its already overvalued IMO
1615307527,"for a crypto company, its awfully centralized 🙄 Their fees are out the ass anyways so I dont use them anymore. I took their 30ish free bucks of crypto and that was it"
1615308428,Guys big news! Time travel is confirmed. So we can all go back to 2010 and buy crypto
1615308439,lmao
1615308594,lets go swissborg
1615308643,then i'll be back from the time travel rich and break the machine
1615308651,so you can't inflate the current economy
1615308670,Next up: Swissborg premium gives Swiss citizenship!
1615308686,uhm technically you won't be coming back rich
1615308692,Swissborg ceo revealed to be @felguerr

1615308697,sure i am
1615308708,Lol it does after 12 years living in Switzerland lol
1615308725,12 years ☠️
1615308735,what if I have 50k CHSB?
1615308760,wanna feel like a premium Swiss
1615309182,They'd probably tell you that for 50k CHSB they will at best just ignore you. Aim for 10m 😉
1615309419,😩
1615309719,is bnb a hold
1615309731,or nah
1615309781,I think it depends on whats announced tomorrow
1615309787,whut
1615309793,what news didn't i see
1615309802,It spiked today because they said there is going to be an announcement tomorrow
1615309808,They didnt give any info on it
1615309814,ahn
1615309814,just said there is an announcement
1615309819,well i have it since
1615309820,105
1615309842,i say a day shorting it when it does
1615309846,"it could end up being like REEF bonds where they hyped the announcement up and then when it was revealed it was boring ass bonds, it dropped hard"
1615309846,but idc about bnb
1615309861,but if its something cool it could spike it up
1615309868,thats the danger of hyping an annoucement
1615309872,true
1615309878,where did you see the announcement
1615309889,Its on Binance creator's twitter
1615309903,https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1369214398204506116?s=21
1615309986,"This is dangerous territory for BNB, its gonna either crash it or pump it. Ill pop popcorn to watch 🍿"
1615310107,😩  please crash abit so i can buy
1615310172,Crash followed by ATH please
1615310226,Go back to 180 and then to 500 pls
1615310228,👀
1615310233,God please
1615310247,Why does SUN have such a strange pattern of spikes?
1615310271,I would say pump and dumb but doubt it
1615310276,"If that announcement is boring af, 180 would be possible"
1615310297,Dont know about 500 tho :/
1615310306,It's too frequent for that
1615310334,"LIT going crazy, why now?"
1615310337,oh no my swissborg is down 40 bucks
1615310397,@storm_awk there was a post grads signal on lit today
1615310406,Yes I saw
1615310436,"The tweet shows on the BNB chart. Any chance that this **is** the hype, and the announcement will add nothing to it or make it go back down?"
1615310450,"I'm in, just curious why now"
1615310570,bnb will beat ETH
1615310573,change my mind
1615310589,Very unlikely
1615310597,whu u think
1615310613,oh right
1615310622,BNB is the native coin of the binance smart chain
1615310627,it is technically a competitor to ETH
1615310650,ye idd
1615310671,"BNB might double or even tripple in value this yeah, but I don't see it coming close to ETH any time"
1615310685,inb4 it actually happens and ETH dies
1615310688,:kekw:
1615310693,Same
1615310698,BNB 2K in 2 years
1615310702,:kekw:
1615310765,"I can smell that ""punch yourself if you sold BNB under $1000"" tweet"
1615310834,"If we're predicting the announcement to be something big, then tonight might be the night to buy :godsgardener:"
1615310868,Anyone else following LTX now?
1615310918,Hang in there. 🙂 it dropped more before and got up up up 🙂
1615310924,im joking
1615310946,i am still up like 130 euro from initial investment
1615311446,did someone here try and make a crypto bot?
1615311454,like something that buys and sells on its own
1615311536,I'm experimenting
1615311547,ye same
1615311568,watchu writing it in
1615311607,Already made one in PHP that runs on certain pairs and alerts if goes up/down certain % from prev 1m candle. Not built the buy/sell because it's too slow
1615311629,whats to slow?
1615311633,PHP
1615311636,ahnnnn
1615311643,like submitting a request
1615311654,Pure PHP max I can get is 3 calls per second
1615311658,it's not binance that takes the order to slow right?
1615311658,ada to 1.2 and  now 1.1 wtf
1615311687,cuz i'm doing it in python
1615311691,I saw a vid of one bot running like a screen full of calls per second
1615311693,have been working 3 weeks on it for now
1615311703,Yeah I just did my first hello world in python today
1615311709,and backtested it for 2 weeks now
1615311713,Then found this Binance package so playing with that now
1615311725,Nice
1615311729,so im just started yesterday with the database behind it so I can easy see what it did
1615311749,yeah there are a lot out there
1615311751,but like
1615311761,you r not using technical indicators right?
1615311787,Nah for now I'm getting it to detect pumps then set a buy instantly
1615311838,"Was thinking of doing a pure day trading one but, analysing macd, BB, Trix etc but that would take ages"
1615311858,Plus I already have a gunbot license
1615311898,how do u detect a pump?
1615311966,"Price and volume rising certain%. It's just guess work, but I saw someone on here post a vid of theirs and made 50% in a few seconds"
1615311966,Like I'm calculating some TI's in my program to get buy signals
1615311981,damn
1615311992,thats crazy
1615312003,0.002 btc to 0.003btc but still
1615312050,hmmmm
1615312054,didn't think of that
1615312058,but ye
1615312059,like
1615312074,have to scan a lotttt of tickers for doing something like that
1615312102,Yeah that's why it needs to be fast
1615312105,sucks that binance doesnt offer trailing orders tb
1615312111,idk atm
1615312115,im buying
1615312124,and selling in like a timespan of few min for 1%
1615312249,Connect to the websockets with ReactPHP
1615312261,Any one knows where u can put for sale NFt self made ?:) somewhere where “no body” can’t put it  and not only “celebs” and anyone here own it? Worth investing ? Or bettter stick to coins 🙂
1615312266,That's why you need a bot 😉
1615312312,ye ii have one
1615312322,but i didnt figure out how to trail tbh
1615312323,like
1615312323,"I can make trades in 30 ms with PHP. It's not the language, it's the distance to Tokyo mainly."
1615312329,placing orders constantly or
1615312340,u run a bot?
1615312406,Multiple. Each dedicated to a task
1615312415,what do you mean
1615312420,with dedicated to a task?
1615312425,just trynna learn btw
1615312440,Interesting. I'll look into that. Much prefer PHP than python
1615312637,Thinking about converting my BNB till tomorrow
1615312649,why
1615312666,"Either a very smart, or super dumb decision"
1615312682,cuz of the announcement or
1615312687,Hodl
1615312720,"cause if BNB drops after the announcement, I get a low entery point while still keeping my gains. If the opposite happens... Well, then I'm just an idiot"
1615312774,"No actually imma hodl and if it decides to go down, I'll just restock :godsgardener:"
1615312846,ye
1615312849,boi
1615312857,its the wap for me
1615312897,Which library are you using for the Binance API?
1615313021,"It's not one bot, one program doing multiple things. One bot does trailing stop loss in certain coins. Then I have one to trade on UP and DOWN tokens.
Working on a futures bot, too..."
1615313148,"It's not as easy as it looks at first glance. Mainly because other people know about that stuff as well and will wreck you intentionally with going just a bit under (or over) your trigger point, then swinging in the opposite direction. 🤔"
1615313268,"`MATIC: New peak at 563 sats! Gained 28.25% from entry @ 439 sats`
Listing day, woop woop! 💪🏻"
1615313434,Nice
1615313572,i am so sad now 😄 i was actualy getting ready to enter matic 😄
1615313578,and it blew up in my face... 😄
1615313586,Its also on my favorites
1615313605,Was watching sky/ atom and matic yesterday when I needed to reinvest
1615313623,And now I’m stuck in ENJ again
1615313657,matic was preparing to make a positive turn around and i was just deciding when to enter... and all of a sudden BOOM BOOOOOOMMM... and i was left with my mouse frozen in place... 🙂
1615313688,"It was bitching about over the last weeks, but two days ago I decided to buy again."
1615313696,Wondering where I have to cut my losses on ENJ
1615313735,"When it drops from $100, no? 😉"
1615313780,I’m not that kind off a believer
1615313851,Just buying a dip that went wrong :’)
1615313943,
1615313949,74% vol increase?
1615313992,"Yup, that's insane. Saw that too"
1615314039,I am actually spending my free day tomorrow trying to write a bot. Not sure what my goals are gonna be yet. But being a software engineer i love making things go automatic
1615314049,lol
1615314052,Me too. Should have sold at 1.87
1615314090,Yea well she already have me quite a lot good old ENJ
1615314093,Guess today is a good day to eat sushi
1615314094,Cant last forever
1615314094,"after success with my pump bot, i will possibly write a YOLO 125x futures bot"
1615314114,spot a trend? go in 125x leverage with 5 dollars lmao
1615314136,https://tenor.com/view/-gif-3965021
1615314138,"even if 5 succeeds out of 100 positions, i think i would still be in profit? lmao"
1615314183,Guzzle
1615314183,Or just set stop loss at the point when the pump starts?
1615314191,and then adjust when it goes up
1615314206,or am i newb and dont understand what i am talking about
1615314211,I didn't know about the Binance streams
1615314258,"for yolo 125x leverage, liq price is very close to entry price lol"
1615314277,under 1% drop in price and liquidated ☠️
1615314290,thats why its yolo bot
1615314306,you don't wanna be the guy who killed himself after GME lol
1615314338,im gonna do some math on paper about this
1615314338,"Try https://github.com/jaggedsoft/php-binance-api. It's another abstraction layer, you don't have to code requests yourself and sign them.
Doesn't support all functions though."
1615314350,he got sent a 200k bill to be fufilled the next week or something
1615314368,lmao
1615314372,Those meme stocks going up rn tho
1615314380,Check gme and amc
1615314401,Tbh I think PHP would be cool to start out on. But think that more gainz can be reached with a faster language?
1615314422,try Node.js
1615314429,i said a faster language
1615314441,its fast enough for a bot
1615314452,much faster than Python ☠️
1615314453,hm okay yeah I was thinking rust
1615314486,not sure how mature its ws library is tho
1615314500,"Didn't try Rust. I wrote my first bot with Python but its dead slow in comparison to Node.js. Especially if u're good with asynchron programming, its perfect"
1615314542,"Cool, I can't wait until tomorrow lol. Time to learn 🤓"
1615314572,Behind the scenes all crypto ppl are just big nerds
1615314594,"As I said, it's not about the language but the distance to Tokyo your bytes have to travel.
Also, PHP isn't slow."
1615314659,"Okay, not slow in general but in comparison to other languages it is. Also depends to the operations you wanna do"
1615314664,"Unless you want to do real HFT. But then you definitely gotta be in Tokyo, ideally in the same Colo as Binance"
1615314697,"Netherlands, but can just host in my DO droplet wherever the closest server is"
1615314697,"Challenge accepted, ima time my ops later."
1615314704,ADA mooning again
1615314726,WTH is happening to SKL?
1615314733,I'll have another look. That was the first thing I played with before building my hand built Guzzle one.
1615314740,"Has to be a PnD, right?"
1615314803,"ADA, BNB, VET, NANO and then even my AMC and GME stocks all making gains today. I woke up in a dream world"
1615314942,Suppose you could run the bot on a Tokyo web server
1615315171,I do
1615315253,:chadcoin:
1615315538,JS denotes JavaScript right? Isn't that more of a front end language rather than backend-y type stuff?
1615315627,Well its basically an environement that can run js code outside of webbrowsers. Node.js is usually used for backendy stuff
1615315652,other js frameworks like Angular is used in front-end
1615315718,actually Angular and such uses another language called Typescript. It's basically Javascript but has some additional stuff

1615317415,I hope ada goes up pretty soon since i put way too much money into a 3x long position
1615317434,NotMatt
1615317449,poor u
1615317454,Ada does what it wants
1615317458,dont get ur hopes up
1615317468,It just wants to sleep right now it seems
1615317471,worst position ever
1615317481,Anyone read about DAG and LTX? Real project. Have done the research. Constellation is the name of the company.
1615317490,I mean my liquidation point is at .63
1615317490,no one care about project
1615317501,show me the chart I tell u good or not good coin
1615317502,ada was stuck around 1.9$ for like 2 weeks once
1615317514,no reason for him to go up now
1615317525,It wasn’t 1.9
1615317535,0.9$
1615317537,excuse me
1615317554,I just want it to go uppp
1615317561,take ur L
1615317565,Like close to 2$
1615317567,sleep it off

1615317577,No way I’m selling
1615317579,🤣 😭
1615317585,enjoy 30 days of sleep
1615317588,I have a good eth position open tho
1615317619,Also my Link position is back in the green
1615317626,After 10 days of pain
1615317679,"I’d love to see btc, eth and ada back to ath"
1615317690,I’d make some serious money
1615317707,wouldnt we all
1615317715,Link seems good
1615317982,Sometime last month I have set my goal this year of besides my salary of earning 100k in trading and investments this year. I think with 10k invested properly its very good possible specially with the current market. U guys agree or should I correct my expectations?
1615318088,Depends how long the market lasts
1615318098,And if history repeats itself
1615318149,Lmao did i jsut see a 3000x spike
1615318163,So at 9am PT on Thursday those 3 will moon temporarily?
1615318182,My ways? I bougt the dip on BTC and BNB. From there on I continued to make small gains by putting a couple hundred coins into coins that were already looking good
1615318194,"True, worst case I need to cash out when it resets"
1615318210,But playing on that the demand will stay
1615318215,If you can spot the market
1615318225,And not buying a dip that dips again :p
1615318257,I don’t have an exit plan yet
1615318324,Today I actually had a terrible experience with an exchange. Could not limit trade on it and so it took a random number it thought it could sell for. But the dip was not deep enough. And lost 1% buying again at higher than I sold because again i could not limit
1615318325,LTX is my exit plan.
1615318365,Worst case usdt?
1615318397,Yea but you have to “give up” then
1615318409,You will always try to recoup losses
1615318417,BUSD if you are on Binance - no fees (for now)
1615318431,if not i should say USDC
1615318434,Rhere was that one announcement coming tomorrow right haha
1615318452,owh no that was for BNB
1615318480,just sell and ride the wave down buying at the bottom
1615318500,or dont sell and just buy at bottom
1615318500,Yea but in 2018 there was no bottom
1615318506,"That's actually still pretty up high in the BB and RSI is 84 on the daily.
Wouldn't be surprised if it dips soon."
1615318530,Unless ENJ doesn't care about TA and overheats even more. 😃
1615318533,And hope the market supply/demand stays the same next time
1615318551,Lets hope Its more in use then 2018 🙂
1615318558,enj is testing 1.65 support 3 times now... i think it will go lower next run...
1615318563,"I am happy with what happened 17 march 2020 happening again

regular marker 15x-ing after a year
crypto going to to moon"
1615318564,Wouldnt settinga stop loss keep the investment safe though? Or does that not always trigger?
1615319104,ur getting 50k by the end of the year unless ur an excellent trader
1615319135,or I write a great bot lmao
1615319270,Guess you accounting potential losses and mistakes
1615319290,yes and market chanegs that throw off ur trading
1615319324,"fair enough, I am relatively new to trading. But been in/known crypto for a few years"
1615319342,thats pretty good
1615319350,then 50k to 80k should be realistic
1615319359,lets see imma set a item in my calendar. week of christmas. send Richy a message
1615319364,I wished I started with more 😦
1615319370,same!

1615319382,please do also prove me wrong
1615319391,"I ""hate""realists in my life"

1615319405,so id love for u to prove me wrong
1615319411,hit that 100k 👍
1615319481,what was ur starting capital?
1615319492,Nah I need to be grounded otherwise I start becoming cocky and make mistakes
1615319492,cause last time I heard u say it was in the 100's
1615319510,"then 50k is probably ""realistic"
1615319594,0k is probably realistic for me
1615319608,shut up jeremy

1615320465,I'm not some kind of trading genius lmao
1615320479,Not even a week
1615320485,Went very well so far
1615320496,Yeah indeed. No losses yet?
1615320545,Was testing around with $100 before investing that much (lost most of that)
1615320622,"The 4k investment was $400 minus one day, but as you already know, you only lose money if you sell"
1615320661,Yeah I remember panicking on the stock market and lost some
1615320709,but one day I was 50 euros down (on a 1000 dollar investment) and thought. but this is not the 8% a year I was told
1615320728,then learnt a valuable lession. The market always finds a way to recover
1615320766,"Yeah, most of the time you just need to wait a couple hours or days"
1615320795,Yup. Or a year (if you started before this time last year)
1615321152,ENJ *might* be warming up for another bullrun. still time to get in if you're willing to risk it
1615321301,whats the current price
1615321318,1.71
1615321322,on phone wanna know if its worth starting laptop
1615321335,hmm and it has kinda been getting support around there right today
1615321336,ATH was 1.95 yesterday
1615321357,"indeed, defended support a few times around 1.65"
1615321398,Starting up
1615321434,Does anyone know what’s happening March 10?
1615321444,in regards to?
1615321469,Binance
1615321479,Or cryptocurrency in general
1615321485,Its gonna be huge -trump meme-
1615321503,Some projects are speculating about pump
1615321515,Just curious to see if someone knows
1615321540,earlier ppl were talking about it most likely going up. But i mean it can just be a pump n dump by binance lmao
1615321548,"not sure, but I do know ADA may be preparing some news/announcements this week"
1615321569,Cz made an announcement of an announcement
1615321575,"I mean ADA will have a very good month, March afaik has a big lineup"
1615321581,For tomorrow that’s why I got curious
1615321593,Earlier the day one telegram was talking about March 10
1615321618,Come on ENJ
1615321625,Help me get breakeven today
1615321627,https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1369214398204506116
1615321635,this is what you're referring to?
1615321665,binance replied with https://twitter.com/binance/status/1369214493620920321
1615321673,yeah smth big could be happening tomorrow
1615321688,maybe that's why BNB has been going crazy?
1615321707,Scrap the maybe
1615321708,or it could be binance pumping its securities to then cash out
1615321732,that would probably crash the crypto market lmao
1615321740,imagine lol
1615321741,big announcement
1615321744,Ahhh today I got an email about futures API
1615321794,"hmmm. if I were to guess, NFTs are really big atm, maybe more progress in getting NFTs more exposure on binance?"
1615321798,nft marketplace?
1615321800,fuck idk lol
1615321808,Yeah
1615321820,andrei releaeed a video about that right today
1615321839,Maybe NFT marketplace
1615321851,"hmmm, so I'm not reaching with that"
1615321858,that could be huge tbh
1615321891,maybe something the twitter thing with owning tweets
1615321898,anybody got a good video explaining how to make some NFTs?
1615321906,hadnt time yet to look about it
1615321922,"that too. binance might attempt to make one-place-for-all, art, tweets, any digital type of media"
1615321934,"because atm, every type has its own separate marketplace"
1615321969,"with tweets, it's extremely simple. art, I wouldn't know"
1615321991,imagine every trump tweet receiving its own coin
1615321994,Cross chain NFT then?
1615322012,Maybe we’ll see
1615322025,the joke is... trump twitter.... nvm lol
1615322053,yeah thing is i know about them
1615322065,have to look how to make them because i could have one to get released
1615322077,"if it's in any way tied to binance's business and it looks like it is, good time to get some BNB"
1615322090,"right as I say that, it's jumping up again"
1615322114,which whale is lurking in the chat
1615322126,"Yes! But I was **promised** $3, now I want it!"
1615322139,me2
1615322145,lololol
1615322182,They don't let you yolo that much in Tier 0 anyway.
1615322185,Do you have a sell order on ENJ Jan?
1615322215,You can Yolo 50 K.
1615322215,"should ENJ have another bullrun, and it's looking more and more likely right now, I'd seriously suggest being careful at around $2 today. might get rejected again. to be clear, I'm not saying ENJ *won't be able to* break $2, but it may need to get rejected a few times before building up enough momentum to go higher"
1615322224,"Nope, I'll let my trailing stop loss bot take care of it. It will exit at -10% under the peak."
1615322228,"orrrrrrrrrrrrrr, it may just happen today. it's been showing so much strength."
1615322237,And then ENJ will take off again without me probably 😂
1615322249,Yea don’t have a bot and almost sleep time
1615322260,Damn you ENJ runs during the night
1615322283,I liked waking up to the BTC run thismorning that ended just as I had my coffee
1615322291,"Oh, you're right! I never put more than 500 in my futures wally tho 😂"
1615322309,"BNB is looking really good rn guys. don't miss out, especially now that we got big news (likely binance-related) coming tomorrow"
1615322310,"Hey guys. Im not hyping anything but CHR is rocketing. Might be the next ENJ and reach 1.00 if continue at this pase.  As always with such hypes it could fall down pretty hard in near future, but hey...profits are profits...right?"
1615322311,"Unless I'm in profit, then there might be 1k or 2 😏"
1615322314,Just because you can yolo 50 K doesn’t mean you should LOL
1615322326,Challenge accepted!
1615322334,Cz is retiring and decommissionning binance
1615322353,If 50 K wasn’t my one year net salary then I probably would LOL
1615322376,Seriously! As soon as I get 5k I will be using 1 to get a new laptop. I just took it off of the charger already emoty
1615322383,How do you calculate a net salary hmmm
1615322390,useless pos
1615322402,You just kind a guesstimate. I think I pay about 7K in taxes a year
1615322413,Damn lol
1615322422,Are you french ? 😂
1615322432,I pay like 30-40k taxes
1615322447,No I’m American
1615322448,Hmm 32000 net salary. Still planning to use half this year in investments lol
1615322459,It’s about 20% of your gross here in America
1615322490,At least here in Oklahoma
1615322501,Yea closer to 50% here
1615322517,No that’s too much
1615322524,40% here
1615322526,Wherw are you from kittie
1615322527,"Ah right, it's true that your gross only has federal and state (if appliacble)"
1615322532,Thats a lot of tax
1615322539,Belgium
1615322554,@dutchortega i am guessing you are dutch. Have you had a tax year yet?
1615322575,It says so on my pay slip every month.
1615322578,"Oh, Nl here. No point in earning more, taxes are progressive here aswell"
1615322584,"Il France we first get social security and retirement and shit, about 20-30%  then get hammered down by federal tax"
1615322623,30k over 2020 (i’m self employed)
1615322645,I mean have you had a crypto tax year yet 😝
1615322698,"Haha no, i just started crypto this year"
1615322734,lmao i still need to figure out how to declare and what i am not required to
1615322857,Crypto Capital Venture on youtube just did a really good video on how to do crypto taxes really fast and easy
1615322861,might be worth checking out
1615322886,Dutch system is different I think?
1615322899,I can do a quick vid too : go live in a crypto tax free country
1615322901,Boom
1615322915,I think in NL if you dont have more than 50k you pay about 2%
1615322915,PT looking better every day
1615322920,https://tenor.com/view/mind-blown-amazed-explosion-space-omg-gif-10279314
1615322934,"Or live in Germany and don't touch your pos for a year: Tax free.
😄 😄 😄 a year ... that's rich 😉"
1615322965,What di you think a reasonable ceiling is for ENJ atm
1615322967,Ich muss im deutschland wohnen !
1615322971,only a year for DE?
1615322976,"daaaaaamn, that's nothing"
1615322998,I believe it'll test $2 again
1615323026,"Ja, mach das! 🙂"
1615323047,"so you could ride until there, or take gradual profit along the way if it gets cancelled somewhere lol"
1615323048,any good entry points anywhere currently?
1615323053,"It's an eternity for ""fast fingers SaneJan"" 😉"
1615323062,hahahahah
1615323091,Mein deutsch ist schreklich...
1615323150,How do they even know if you held for one year?
1615323156,proof
1615323159,paperwork
1615323172,"if you deliver it, you're good to go"
1615323244,Überhaupt nicht
1615323258,Does keeping my money in BUSD count? 😂
1615323284,Lmao I can cycle to the border. Just open a postbox in germany and regidter there. That is how it works right 😂
1615323288,ofc it does
1615323317,"but I believe exchanging, selling and buying for another currency resets it"
1615323325,"I may be wrong, but that's how US treats it"
1615323335,you have to hold it in cold storage for a year to be tax-free
1615323337,but still in USDT you are pretty safe if you are in the US
1615323345,"Uhm... you look at the trade history and if there's no trade for a year, you're good. You can use a software like CoinTracer also to keep track of multiple positions. Like you can buy, buy, buy, but the minute you sell - it's counted against the first trade (fifo)"
1615323358,there ya go
1615323363,anywhere else youbare acrewed because of the insane inflation
1615323368,You probably won't have to pay much taxes on that anyway 😄
1615323380,"Yeah, probably"
1615323452,"btc in red, BNB pulling up, that's a sight"
1615323464,"The first coin i bought (after btc) was ENJ @0.20 after reading something about it on a dutch website in january. Got 2k coins. What do you think guys, sell or hold?"
1615323481,goddamn
1615323484,hold for now I'd say
1615323502,but don't forget about it
1615323506,NFT hype is passable
1615323514,"Fast fingers saneJan, love it😂😂"
1615323524,Enjin *seriously* has more to it than nft
1615323528,you can sell so you at least brake even on your trade
1615323531,A beautiful one
1615323532,In France it only counts when you convert to Fiat. Will have to buy a tesla in btc...
1615323535,keep the rest in
1615323547,"no doubt, but I think the current bullrun is primarily because of NFT hype"
1615323563,"not trying to devalue the coin, holding some right now"
1615323579,"Well, you can't pay your taxes in doge"
1615323656,Even the government doesnt want doge
1615323692,"That may well be, but I'm personally more or less ignoring this bull run and have more faith in all their upcoming stuff and partnerships"
1615323713,"fair enough, that's a good way to look at it"
1615323714,Do you guys know about any hype on LTC? Something with another 10x thisnyear if yountrade between LTC and BTC
1615324046,Jeesus fucking christ CHR up anothet few cents. Dont miss out on this. It will definitely retract but i think it could go up over next few days weeks
1615324082,"any good entry points anywhere currently, guys?"
1615324104,Don't time the market just put thw same amount of money in any grandfather stock and do that the same time every week (DCA)
1615324130,further BNB ENJ are both looking good both had announcements coming think that is the summary of what is going on
1615324239,#PrayForBNB🙏
1615324250,We'll see 400 soon
1615324260,Just gotta pray
1615324304,that is another 40% but sure lets pray 🙏
1615324339,Went up a couple hundred percent last month
1615324365,hm 162 yeah and did not even go back down
1615324385,BNB is safu
1615324385,then 40% isnt that bad i guess

Unfortunately it sold on Black Tuesday two weeks ago and the re-enter targets weren't hit... 😢"
1615325380,please share with me if u find any
1615325898,Everyone buy ADA now... when it explodes in the coming week! Because in the coming week I'm about to say I told you so!
1615325916,No shilling here!
1615325948,Rule #6
1615325953,"Just announced that US House will vote for final passage of COVID-19 relief bill tomorrow. As with the initial house vote and senate approval, this will likely end up pushing btc's price up. Perhaps even more then last two votes earlier this month as this vote will cement its go-ahead. it's the final stage that is extremely likely to pass due to the initial success."
1615326104,KEY lookin even more promising today
1615326282,also something with all the money being given out is being printed. So BTC/USD will be going up due to USD being inflated. against any other currency we will still have to see
1615326664,What if I'm not shilling for a coin but instead the sweet sweet taste of Coca-Cola
1615326702,You saying I need to buy cola stocks?
1615326720,"Nope, just to run out to your local supermarket and enjoy the cool crisp flavor"
1615326737,Its 11pm 😦
1615326753,24 hour liquor store?
1615326763,That’s not a thing here
1615326771,Wow
1615326805,The gasstation on the highway I guess
1615326860,When I go to the us a new world opens up for me
1615326872,Places being open after 10pm
1615326895,"man, so happy you told me about websockets 👍 😄   just been playing with it, using that jaggedsoft as a guide to get bookTicker for a particular symbol (they only had bookTicker for all pairs). Its like instant - quicker than the https://cryptowat.ch data I see . Cheers man. PHP rox"
1615326953,Truly a country that cares for it's insomniacs
1615326973,I blame the strong labor unions
1615327037,Me living in a rural village also doesn’t really helps me out
1615327057,Going offtopic too much
1615327070,Go ENJ?
1615327076,Or is that shilling
1615327101,Only shilling if you tell people to buy it
1615327122,Instead of explaining why you like it and giving it a solid recommendation
1615327146,"When they say no shilling they mean more no ""Hey, go buy ENJ"""
1615327178,"You can totally say ""I really like ENJ because..."""
1615327324,also something with a 9pm curfew lmaoo
1615327586,Oh yea that’s a thing also here
1615327613,Not sure where I would go to since everything is closed anyway
1615327816,That's fine
1615328371,ZIL still a great buy?
1615328564,just recalculated my BPS loss
1615328576,"0,03235418 BTC loss. :virgin:  back in february"
1615328595,any one notice the CVNT 10.7k% rise today?
1615328970,BNB
1615329238,wait could this have something to do with $BNB
1615329363,was being related to this
1615329577,"Employees: ""Go home Elon, u're drunk"" - it was related to this I believe"
1615329639,"lmao but like the announcement of an announcement. Maybe they are getting together with another exchange or $BNB is fusing or something and that is why there was a big transaction

its just the timing of it all"
1615329697,"yep, nothing on the news so far tho"
1615329703,plot twist. your BTC balance gets copied as BNB
1615329713,hahahahah
1615329733,yay reward BTC whales
1615329735,what and binance runs with the diff
1615330769,"those who got in to SYL and waiting for  Casper protocol.  what ur thought would be worth to invest more in? thoughts and opinions , not looking for financial advice 😛"
1615331104,"SYL is 5 times cheaper than Casper so if each SYL and Casper both went to $1 each, you'd make 5 times more on SYL. 
Both have 10bn tokens avail, so need a 10bn market cap to reach $1"
1615331120,"But then Casper seems to be more popular, so more likely to succeed"
1615331161,I'll probably do 50/50 on both
1615331213,Already got my SYL bag
1615331516,I am gonna fill my SYL bag abit more soon
1615331533,casper will probably if I get in be 200 on option 1 300 on option 3
1615331535,thank u for reply. I have 100k SYl.. if it comes to 1USD... id be more then happy 🙂 not looking for 100usd lol also I underatand it migh take time to get to even 10 cents.. but it was cheap enough to buy 🙂 so leaving it to ripe would not hurt 🙂 but could fruit 🙂
1615331548,casper thinking same
1615331811,I want my cash back. Literally been holding my ENJ for over a day and I'm still not rich
1615331907,"Just reading the chad chat, seems Casper might be over subscribed"
1615331990,"If I miss out, I'll probably buy as soon as it hits exchange (option 3 sellers). Usually ICO prices peak shortly after exchange listing, then dip, then slowly tank for ages"
1615332008,But not all ICOs are the same.... Could be opposite
1615332092,Boson Protocol is another ICO I might buy too
1615332100,But no info on release date
1615332241,but option one gives u half price .. thought its locked for a year
1615332314,"Yep, but might not be able to buy Option 1 if it's over subscribed (i.e. more people signed up before me)"
1615332413,i think the subscription is just a email notification when it goes online not an actual reservation
1615332469,im not sure how it works.. never bought like that before. though its open sale  and I jsut buy what I want/can
1615332598,Any good buy atm or just need another dip?
1615332605,Man if SYL gets to a single dollar
1615332612,We are going whales
1615332618,Dont get your hopes that high
1615332648,But hell if its get 1$ im organising a chad dinner at Geneva
1615332651,😂😂
1615332653,i dont.. 10 c woild be good start 🙂
1615332779,i understand it might take a year or more...:P
1615332787,but  fingers crossed 🙂
1615332843,Should I put 100$ on that v
1615332844,?
1615332913,SYL? Definitely! Something for months to come.
1615332951,Humm will take a look at it haha might give it a try
1615332958,Im not too familiar with ico
1615332987,Well I’m not too familiar with trading at all but planning to get into it soon when I have more $ 😂 and do some bots for it 🙂
1615333077,"Well, an ICO is always a bit of a risk. Because it could be a shit project or a rug pull. Lots of scam ICOs a few years ago.
But XSL Labs looks legit and if Swiss has done the research, it's good.
Gotta buy from them directly cause it's not tradeable on any exchange yet. But when it hits exchanges, it's gonna moon!"
1615333157,I see ! 🙂 any release date planned ?
1615333170,we could also be falling at the hands of McAfee too hahaahaha
1615333201,Thinking of starting a side hustle. Shot calls for shoes. I give TA analyzed calls  in exchange for a pair of heels.
1615333209,he staged it all.. not to eat his dick as  BTC didnt get to 100k 😛
1615333228,"@Matt ENJ seems to have weakened a bit. still on the trend line, but the volume is really poor. just a warning since you said you'd enter when I did"
1615333261,put a stop limit at my entrance
1615333264,I said ENJ dicc was gonna go soft.
1615333271,thanks for the warning tho
1615333277,sure thing
1615334076,ada looking good for entrance
1615334083,probably gonna retest fib level
1615334100,1.21
1615334274,retest which level
1615334312,"my bad misepelled, $1.21"
1615334405,yeah this zone is a slow move zone
1615334422,it stayed here for some days before going to the expected 0.5-0.618 fibo zone
1615334456,so i __*personally*__ wouldnt be surprise if it takes it time
1615334478,"would be better tho, if it gets back on track when IOHK releases some news... oh man"
1615334510,enj is playing with my nerves ugh
1615334536,same tbh
1615334565,ada got rejected at 1.21 with 34m volume
1615334570,im kinda scared of enj man
1615334579,now it's heading back up with like 5x less volume
1615334585,I'd be surprised if it breaks 1.21
1615334609,"havent jumped because my heart belongs to this polyamorous relationship between me, ada and eth, but idk might be wrong but some bad vibes i have"
1615334712,made some lines here on btc
1615334730,could we be following the second one from the right?
1615335054,"12 hours left till it's at $3, if Crypthanos is right 😉"
1615336161,i love CAKE 😊
1615336279,COS/BTC guys pump incoming 29mins
1615336304,yeah... i love cake too... 😉
1615336318,how sure you are
1615336320,why
1615337313,@Cryptoknight I bought the dip on ENJ.
1615337366,I had cake today. $Cheese Cake 👌🏻
1615337539,I wish I could trade at 50x 😭
1615337650,
1615337689,well
1615337694,you can join tf up to 50x
1615337706,but risk is gonna roost
1615337759,Te fuck did I miss that?? I only did 3x margin on LIT...
1615337794,"Ah, was too focused on LIT/BTC pair..."
1615337795,:kekw: one day il long and die
1615337898,I can add more?!?!?
1615337905,i mean
1615337909,you can increase leverage
1615337912,I dont even know the difference 🤣
1615337915,and add more funds
1615337926,my eth position started as a virgin 4x
1615337929,it grew to 12x
1615337937,Uhhh
1615337938,chad
1615337943,Im a noob
1615337948,Imma stick to the basics
1615337955,Not trying to confuse myself
1615337958,"man if we got 2k, ill get even ABOVE my ATH on pumps and dumps"
1615337977,Thats pretty good
1615337981,What %?
1615338040,i dont even know!
1615338041,hahahaha
1615338053,when this whole move started i had 85€ at my binance wallet
1615338060,now 170
1615338064,i guess 100% more
1615338065,"I was analyzing LIT against BTC, as is usual with an altcoin. Didn't see LIT is traded against USDT and BUSD as well. I thought 3x was the highest leverage I could do. 😬"
1615338086,Ohhh okay that makes sense
1615338093,I think u can 100x
1615338118,Thats tastey
1615338154,"LITUSDT? No, 50 is max"
1615338223,"I know, because #yolo 😏"
1615338992,Is there any reason why btc fee are 27$ to transfer to syl ?
1615339054,"Oh okay, didnt know"
1615339091,Use ltc then 💀
1615339111,Bro really did 50x 💀
1615339115,Oh ltc is lower ?
1615339126,Will swap my btc to ltc 😂
1615339126,Yes
1615339137,Its like 10 cents
1615339144,Or something
1615339159,This aint happening now. BTC went up too high. We're back to day -4
1615339176,YAY! Now we're ENJ buddies
1615339527,look like they dont want my $ website is down i guess i cant access it anymore XD
1615339621,you ok @SeineJanie?
1615341557,honestly wondering if SYL will do a X100
1615341874,"This entire BTC pump and dump is a huge conspiracy to lower ENJ and MANA. BTC is scared. However, its barely scraped ENJ. Just sent it back a day thats all, while all other ALTS are crying. BTC is scared of showing people just how irrelevant it is. 

Tomorrow, the news will read: Bitcoin CEO arrested for market manipulation. Claims temporary insanity."
1615342039,I think a enj short might work
1615342054,Looks like stuff is finally starting to head back down
1615342087,About dang time. Need prices to get reasonable before pay day.
1615342347,Does anybody here stake ADA - I have a few questions or two about it
1615342410,ye
1615342424,Thank fuck I had been periodically moving my stop losses up all day. They all triggered but at least I'm in profit still.
1615342446,"Also, wtf even this is red bar cafe day."
1615342453,When will it end....
1615342456,😂
1615342592,I'm trying to stake from the Daedalus wallet. It says the next epoch starts in 1 day 19 hours
1615342609,What is an epoch? @Blackhartd
1615342620,a period of 5 days
1615342631,"after each one, coins get dropped like a lotto"
1615342646,get in a pool before next epoch starts
1615342665,"you'll have 1 or 2 epochs of test inside a pool, then you will be elegible for earning ada"
1615342681,"Awesome, thanks so much buddy"
1615343441,Lol this xsl website trolled me I bought ltc can’t buy those syl and my ltc going down while trying to access the website
1615343489,How people can do a project like that if they can’t handle a website ... make me wondering sometimes 😂
1615344263,God dammit!!! This was all batman's doing! What an ass
1615344343,https://tenor.com/view/batman-dance-classic-batman-old-dancing-gif-4867455
1615344373,Cuntfaced motherfucker trying to kill my ENJ!
1615344806,"long on ada, link, aave, xem, atom, comp, bat, algo, short on eth/btc - anyone expecting any breakouts?"
1615344819,we bullish on enj too?
1615344915,not until we know what the king decides
1615345354,ENJ is going to go MAD now
1615345375,"I excepcted a steep drop at 1.59, but noooo. It goes up bullish while BTC goes down"
1615345552,"unless I see ENJ at $25 by the end of this week, I'm afraid it's not gonna cut it"
1615345556,:kekw:
1615345760,lol im seeing 1.8~ but im down with $ 25
1615345828,So this is ALT coin
1615345843,While this is my little baby ENJ
1615345861,what about what happened today
1615345873,More for me!! YAY!!
1615345881,"btc pumped like insanity, enj remained sideways... btc dumped, enj dumped"
1615345885,so wtf was that about
1615345952,Nah. ENJ didnt dump at all actually. Somehow the moving volume in BTC affects ENJ. Not price movements. Still dont understand that completely. But still. Look at it! Its just 1 day back. We're back to yesterdays price. No biggie. And now it will go up even steeper. I love this damn thing!
1615345974,lmaoo
1615346020,Shut up. I love a coin. Theres no shame in it. Too bad im already marrried.
1615346033,OKKKKKK
1615346039,now you're reaching hahahha
1615346045,Im trying
1615346052,In a very good mood.
1615346143,Best part. My ENJ coins are at 1.3x the original count because i was able to short it since it was predictable. 1.3x bascially means $90 per coin when this is finally $70 at the end of the year
1615346359,Check out whats happening right now with BTC and ENJ. Its super strange
1615346392,bro why you sucking off enj
1615346398,I mean he's right lol
1615346425,Dont be silly. You should NEVER suck on a coin. Its a choking hazard
1615346445,bro go fuck your wife or something
1615346459,you to horny for enj
1615346489,"Stay civil, and so will i. Or else"
1615346498,k bro
1615346512,or else what
1615346524,what u guys think BTC will do? 🤓
1615346530,Uhh. I wont. Duh. Cant you read?
1615346544,It will fall again i think. To 50 or so.
1615346557,"I think it'll proceed to struggle, continue sideways movement and then slightly build back up"
1615346616,Sideways at 53k? Is that realistic? A few of the streamers iv been watching have been predicting 75K by may. Maybe up?
1615346682,btc needs a new ath
1615346701,even if it's just 500 up from the previous one
1615346764,pretty sure it'll try to build back up to 58k from here on out
1615346772,Ol m8 paper hands shiller back atit agen
1615346777,now will we see whales again try to liquidate longs? maybe
1615346781,but I can't predict that
1615346808,all I know is that 2T USD is getting certified tomorrow and that money is being printed and sent out starting this month
1615346813,btc will rise
1615347123,That would be awesome for alts
1615347165,"Not if this 75k thing is real, no?"
1615347262,😒  Drinking so early in the morning?
1615347284,"We get it, you bought enj"
1615347286,B r u h
1615347299,Its all youve talked about for a week straight
1615347359,I thought u said it was gonna hit $3 in 4hrs time 🤨 🤨
1615347373,this sideways movement on btc is scary.. it's also learning downwards... careful everyone. it could go anywhere
1615347381,"When guys like you get involved, you sort of call for that. Its called PSYCHOLOGY!"
1615347406,:kekw:
1615347492,Nice DP
1615347505,Ty i try my best
1615347519,Its been my dp for almost 4yrs now
1615347543,Id like to interject to ask what DP means
1615347555,See 30m graph. I think its going to fall hard
1615347583,"1) Double penetration
2) Display picture
3) Deadpool
4) Deep Pockets
5) ENJ"
1615347593,I was refering to no. 2
1615347610,I think PP is the better acronym
1615347615,Yeah
1615347624,Dont know why i went for the double penetration version of that
1615347625,"1) Profile PIcture
2) What I gave your mum last night"
1615347645,2) A poor personality?
1615347666,A peewee peepee?
1615347763,so pleased i sold
1615347780,even if it moons - its just too stressful to hold right now!!
1615347806,Wait you actually sell your crypto?
1615347809,Pfffft
1615347922,Facts
1615348555,
1615348565,BAN
1615349091,"Nononononono, you can't just move the goal posts like that. You can't just claim that BTC is basically dead and will be replaced by ENJ, say ""$3 within two days, most likely 10 hours"" and then retract majorly on that."
1615349225,Keep going. ENJ can hear you. SHE needs motivation to hit the deadline
1615349234,"Yeah. I went to sleep and 15 minutes later everything tanked, apparently. 😂
Luckily I only had 100 usdt in those two yolo positions. Exited BTC 125x earlier. 😆"
1615349263,Theres still like 6 hrs left though
1615349283,It's going 2x in 6 hrs?
1615349292,oh goooood!
1615349298,Never say never
1615349398,@SeineJanie Can you explain how volume changes in BTC can affect ENJ?
1615349820,"No, because you keep making this stuff up. Like ""usage support"" at 1.61... where is that gone to now?"
1615349848,It was beating that down for almost 15 mins. At 1.603
1615349939,Only finally when BTC tanked like mad did it make it through. But then the buy orders kicked in and threw it back up
1615350063,"Just one favour please. Take a 2 charts view with BTC and ENJ BUSD. 

Its super wierd. Iv seen it both follow BTC, go the other way AND be completely unaffected by it. 
Makes me think that maybe its some other metric im not aware of"
1615350197,I'd posted a chart here before.
1615350266,@SeineJanie
1615350492,"On 1m timeframe there doesn't necessarily have to be a 1:1 correlation. What you're circling is 20 minutes, that's not even 2 full candles on the 15m."
1615350559,and in addition to that you are showing BTC going up while ENJ is going down. a coin can lose popularity and go down on its own. You are acting like it going down while BTC is going up is a good thing
1615350593,"Yes, because it's *independent* of BTC. It's free! 😏"
1615350618,If BTC was plummeting while ENJ was skyrocketing then MAYBE you would have a case
1615350641,but showing your coin going down while BTC is going up shows nothing
1615350662,Right now ENJ is -11% and BTC is -0.83%...
1615350690,Oh ya wasn't ENJ suppose to be at 3$ by now?
1615350704,oh wait thats next year. Sorry I got the time zones mixed up
1615350710,🤷‍♂️
1615350712,This week
1615350723,No it's got 6 hrs left till the deadline. 😂
1615350739,Dont forget to carry the 1 when dealing with time
1615350740,Yeah. Maybe i messed that up. Theres something fishy here though. Will ping you when i can explain it better
1615350759,"I took his ""in two days"" as 48 hours from when he made that statement, should be in 6 or 7 hrs."
1615350793,Ill be watching! Also I kinda maybe expanded my ETH position because of this dip 😂
1615350803,Bet you cant even explain that
1615350816,"""Most likely in 10 hours""...
https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/818455103442386987"
1615350821,I was memeing on how ridiculous you have been with times
1615350830,Lol. You're going to be really pissed if it actually happens in this time
1615350833,There is no explaining your ridicuolousness
1615350861,Me buying 2.5 more ETH during this dip had more sense than your explanations and Im pretty sure I am half insane
1615350862,There is. Look down at your peewee peepee
1615350896,"Also, i believe in something. You guys dont. As simple as that. Its a free world, unless you want to vote trump back."
1615350915,I believe in ETH 2k
1615350928,That is about all I want to believe in rn
1615350947,"Actually, I think a downward channel seems to be forming on ENJ. Maybe I should short it... 🤔"
1615350962,"That might net you some dough when it reaches ""3$"""
1615350963,Please dont
1615350971,And I believe that long term in crypto there's only up. But not for shitcoins
1615350995,"Will be reversed to 0.3$ by then, probably"
1615351007,Why not? Am I angering ENJ?
1615351028,Its going to make people stop playing the games that earn ENJ which keeps the price up
1615351031,"This is where i stop listening and start arguing. You may not believe in NFT's, but ENJ a LOT more than that. Pretty sure Azure is running on ENJ."
1615351037,*with
1615351051,because added volume 100% = added value right?!? /s
1615351063,No. Uses 100%=value
1615351096,"Im not going into this again. Believe, dont believe, DYOR i suppose"
1615351140,"Dude, nobody wants to take away your belief. We actually don't want to see you get rekt because you're blindly in love with a coin!
Trade with your head, not with your gut."
1615351162,"I dont think you even DYOR. Im pretty sure your relying on Daxx's research as a lot of things you say ""when i can explain it better"""
1615351203,This^ You gotta think logically. You cant get emotionally attached to a coin
1615351206,Thats how you lose money
1615351254,"Its not the belief in the coin for me really. Its the concept of what it does and what its for. Again, read up if you care, not about the coin, but about the stuff that integrates with the coin. No one cares about money, you care about what you do with that money."
1615351289,"But yeah, not so blind to not have a stop loss in place"
1615351303,"Okay, that's good!"
1615351316,I am. A lot. But that doesnt mean i havent done my own
1615351336,"I could research for an hour straight, and it still will be 1% of all the images and links he's sent me"
1615351595,"Another thing, its good to be hopeful for your coin for sure but you should stop putting dates on value marks"
1615351639,"Sure we all want our coins to 2x in the next few days but just focus on getting green days. Don't say ""3$ by this day"". You are going to burn yourself out real quick when you keep pushing the goal post back"
1615351698,You seem passionate about ENJ which is cool and I really do hope it succeeds for you but you gotta stay deattached from it too. trading is a mental game
1615351700,True. Its ok though. This is just a hobby. I rarely finish those on time 🤣
1615351732,I was stressing the fuck out when I first got into futures. I still stress out every once in a while
1615351747,Sometimes you gotta remove emotion from it
1615351757,"I aint getting into futures ever. Never took a loan, never got a credit card."
1615351778,"Its not really a ""loan"" persay even though they are lending you crypto"
1615351782,You cant go into debt
1615351806,"your loaned crypto is attached to your position and if your loss equals your position size, it closes itself"
1615351814,There is no way to end up owing money to the exchange
1615351824,"if you put 400$ in, you cant lose more than 400$"
1615351844,so youres saying theres no way it can go tits up
1615351849,Oh. thats nice
1615351852,You can lose all your money
1615351853,which is why it's so sick
1615351857,but you cant lose any EXTRA money
1615351870,I think im getting into futures next
1615351870,there is no way for you to be in debt to Binance
1615351881,🤣
1615351887,Thanks!
1615351889,let me know if you need help. Futures is my favorite
1615351895,Oooo. Fun.
1615351898,I currently have like 40k in ETH loaned rn lol
1615351903,Its pretty insane
1615351909,fucking hell lol
1615351913,Oh yeah. its because of the USDT thing that i didnt get into it also
1615351922,Lolol
1615351927,"40,527.39 USDT is the size of my current position"
1615351944,I kinda maybe am a little insane
1615351952,but hey gotta make that tesla money somehow
1615351956,#JeremysTeslaFund
1615351960,hell yeah
1615351969,"nah man, futures is so freaking fun and exciting"
1615351977,and can be so damn rewarding
1615351998,I kinda added more ETH to my pile during the dip like a insane person 👀
1615352007,"with no ability to go into debt, with stop-losses, ability to choose as little or as much leverage, market orders so you can go in and out at any time, it's really not that scary"
1615352013,you have all the tools to help your self and avoid loss
1615352029,My recommendation is throw 100$ or less in the ring
1615352036,and stick to 2-5x for your first few trades
1615352041,dip your feet in the water
1615352044,get comfortable
1615352049,then start moving your trade up
1615352062,im trading with 12x rn because I am comfortable with that
1615352089,Start small then increase
1615352120,"Then when you become real retarded like some of the futurist, you can try out 125x 😂"
1615352136,lol
1615352142,well said tho!
1615352171,Thanks! I setup a futures 101 course. Just waiting for Alan to add it
1615352213,"Its currently barebone. Just explaining cross vs isolated, liq price, and things of that nature"
1615352231,but it will at least get some of the people started who have never tried it before
1615352251,Ill add to it when I have time. This week has just been busy af for me
1615352266,also ETH is almost back to 1800 🙏

1615354877,@felguerr @Jelle if you guys want to look into it I honestly think it's a good shout up 50% from the time the tweet hit 4h ago with minimal volume
1615354904,

1615355505,Check on how ENJ has recovered
1615356424,b r u h
1615356573,>10%
1615357207,It’s more volatile than other coins at the moment. Hasn’t recovered just yet. Good to make money off though if people are swing trading
1615357277,"Here, have some english."

1615358044,Good morning :) Maybe I should cancel my newspaper subscription. They don't have any crypto news  😁
1615358051,Everyone was freaking out. I just bought more and watched a movie 🍿
1615358070,Now im just watching ETH recover

1615358134,He’s not having a great time
1615358167,He will get punished if he doesn’t give me his binance password
1615358178,I’m money hungry
1615358201,Thats unfortunate. I can give you some of my negative money if that will save matt
1615359226,STMX having a run
1615359781,LIAR! I thought you said futures meant no loans. Then how do you have negative money
1615359801,I meant -money as in loss
1615359804,not like owed money
1615359807,like loss money
1615359820,"Oh, in that case, @NotMatt Im in too"

1615368852,where is it going down
1615368854,?
1615368869,dont see it. tell me I'll buy more :))
1615368887,ws 1.06 this morning now 1.07.. ( gbp) so dont see any down..
1615369289,"the new ""basic premium""  with 2000 staking will atract more people..  as 1.5 Yield nd 0.75 % on transaction fees"
1615369300,I can tell by my value
1615369425,Team ETH to 2k 💪🏻
1615369450,"can u explain to me ""3 weeks old"""
1615369491,i dont get it. time to sale and buy later? or buy now more as its going up up up? or u mean fallin value AVAIlable for sale?
1615369570,can someone help with margin stuff?
1615371172,0.75% is what Binance charge on trading if you pay with BNB. Whats the benefit of SwissBorg?
1615371197,"sorry 75% of 0.9%, so even less"
1615371211,(only learning about it today tbh)
1615371282,i thought it was 0.075% with bnb)
1615371303,1.5 Yeild. Id benefit. Plus price appreciation of token.
1615371379,Also fixed 1% fees otherwise. Good price.  Easy translation. I send money form my bank. It got credited in 3 seconds. A like Bnb takes sometimes an hour. So if any price spike I can’t buy it. As money take time to come ..
1615371418,Me personally seeing Swiss borg as easy use friendly and with room to grow
1615371546,"Thanks to Swiss  mentioning It, I got in. Got for 1 usd. Then a bit more. Since the day I’m in it’s the only “green” balance I have from investment.  They keep it all simple. And I like it. And I’m sure many more will that’s I’ll help CHSB to go up 🙂"
1615371586,Also I buy to hold not to scalp 5/10% here and there
1615372485,Thoughts on $DEGO ?
1615372509,I'm gonna buy some but it's currently overbought so a bit skeptical
1615372530,But long term it's definitely gonna rise. It only has a supply of 21mil
1615372658,Did the big announcement binance founder was talking about already happen?
1615372701,i wanna know if it has anything to do with the 933 BTC that suddenly got transferrer lmao
1615372731,What's this?
1615372740,Hope that person goes all into BNB :godsgardener:
1615372759,this. @AJ777
1615372826,$DEGO is out in 20 minutes.
1615372837,It's one of the few coins with a low supply...
1615372857,It's risen to 12USD already I think after getting listed on Binance it will go very high.
1615372905,$50m of BTC shouldn't be too hard to weather
1615372910,Long term I think 100USD. I envy the guys who bought at .38 and are still holding😭😭
1615373063,thats why I'm sticking to ICOs - loading up when prices are at their lowest
1615373083,Where do you buy them on?
1615373093,their website
1615373107,well before they hit exchanges
1615373187,Oh ok
1615373191,"But the issue is, there are tons of new ICO's coming out on a daily basis. It's tiering to keep track of all of them and hand pick the ones with potential."
1615373197,I tried tried buy some from DEGO but it was very hard...
1615373214,but thats the same picking any already existing coin
1615373221,wroth trying to buy some?:)  or im too late as its 12 USd lready lol
1615373226,"take ADA for example - so my hype, yet I'm down 20% since buying last week"
1615373226,DEGO is definitely strong.. but its just too hard to even find..
1615373253,I'm still buying  a little even if its a short term hold. After getting listed there will be the usual pump and dump
1615373273,it will go up. im bit down still but not worried. slowly its getting stabler and will go up up up.. mean while staking gives few extra Adas.)
1615373282,"But yes for a healthy rise it has has go down again
.."
1615373295,"putting only $100 on each ICO that doesn't look like a scam, some return 10,000%, some are rugpulls. Thats why you gotta spread your bets. ICO time more likely to get hundreds of thousands of tokens/coins, rather than have already missed the boat"
1615373318,Which ones have you made the most out of?
1615373387,"not bought an ICO for years, but take a look at post-grads-podium for the calls there"
1615373410,"$FLOW - Had a sale price of $0.10, the price currently is $20.53. This is a profit of 20430%.

$SOL - Had a sale price of $0.22, the price currently is $17.66. This is a profit of 7927%.

$NEAR - Lowest option sale price $0.29, highest is $0.40, the price is currently $3.62. This is a profit of 1055% - 1493%."
1615373417,CHZ is almost 20% down USDT. time to buy some?)) any CHZ owners?:)
1615373529,Damn alright! Did you buy any of these
1615373545,"Right now my bets are ok DEGO, ADA and VET"
1615373557,"like i said, i've not done any ICOs for years. last one 2016/17 Bancor"
1615373559,lets hope XYL will do same trick:) or casper 🙂
1615373575,Gonna get some today
1615373583,registrations closed on SYL
1615373591,maybe just temporarily

1615373687,could be cause of website down? or we cant buy more at all? i got 100k.. was hopin to get 100k more
1615373688,Casper then
1615374738,Is there a way to get to know about coins that are going to be listed on Binance before it happens?

1615374797,any thoughts on ACRIA network? worth buying in now early?:)
1615375338,You guys should go check up on HOT(holochain) it's a really good project and at a low price atm

1615376413,"Does anyone have COTI in their wallet, nice little jump today; guess this might be one of those coins that will go down as quickly as it goes up in the short term but looks ok for holding"
1615376433,I got this issue 1 min after my registration so didn’t have time to buy 😦

1615377126,Haha yeah but they call it that
1615377140,Phb pair on binance show larger volume
1615377469,"yo. i just realised. the only reason indicators, chart patterns and retracements works is because people believe that it will work and buy the coin and thats what the actual reason is for the coins going up. because everyone collectively believes it will go up when they are the reason it will go up."
1615377521,It's like a grassroots ponzi scheme 😆

1615387445,@Cryptoknight do you still own full bag of enj?
1615387450,I think it was the other way around
1615387452,Yeah
1615387479,Why?
1615387486,so you mean Enjin needs microsoft for microsoft's own project?

1615387751,Ofcourse not to bad
1615387759,Only 20%
1615387766,Strange
1615387812,nah didnt change
1615387829,Its ok. Thats not bad either
1615387830,🤷‍♂️
1615387871,finally you fixed it
1615387898,I put a careful bet on ENJ which I expect to get fulfilled today 🙂
1615387934,Going up? Might be a little dangerous. ENJ has a habit of staying still for a day
1615387973,"that's too careful with 50x man, you gotta at least increase the risks a bit"
1615388014,50x is the maximum. Maybe if I remove some USDT so that the liq point comes closer to the current rate?`😬
1615388042,"well, see? there are always workarounds"
1615388108,Actually I meant to do 30x but I forgot to change the factor before placing the order. Guess it's meant to be then
1615388179,"not as bad as me, today i wanted to go short on ETH with 10x, but I realized I forgot to change it from 100x lmao"
1615388187,I am in x75
1615388189,for real in xrp
1615388194,its like 2hour
1615388204,and I still +10% -10% it's not doing anything
1615388490,y not stop loss?!
1615388502,It's cheaper than liquidation
1615388503,"so if i wanted to margin trade SUN with the 3x option available, what would i need to do?
transfer funds into the right account is the first bit, but what after"
1615388524,SUN/BTC or SUN/USDT?
1615388530,btc
1615388530,"Do you expect ENJ to go down to 1,49? What SL would you recommend?"
1615388561,"No, not anytime soon. But before you remove margin to increase the liq price, set a stop loss... I dunno, 10% below entry?"
1615388574,so 1.503
1615388598,"I'm not actually going to remove margin. But if I do, I'll set a SL at 1,503 🙂"
1615388629,Then transfer BTC into margin account with the respective button:
1615388658,
1615388658,"once ive transferred, im not sure what im meant to do after"
1615388666,Wanna go long or short?
1615388670,long
1615388678,at 313
1615388682,til 333
1615388700,"Leave the ""borrow"" selection, then just issue a regular limit order. You will have more BTC available than you put in because of margin"
1615388720,oh really? when i tried that it felt like the same amount
1615388725,let me try again
1615388784,yea its the smae
1615388787,same
1615388798,And when autoliquidation kicks in you have to pay a fee
1615388834,"oh right, I think you have to ""borrow"" too"
1615388841,right next to transfer
1615388848,that's why I only got 2x the other day 😄
1615388861,so i borrow btc?
1615388907,@SeineJanie Could you please take a look at the chart of ENJ and of KAVA. Is it possible that we have an accurate trend prediction  using that?
1615389090,"I think it's explained here: https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/360030486551
But I haven't done it yet and it says i can borrow 0.000000 BTC 😄 So I'm obviously doing sth wrong"
1615389103,yea hey
1615389108,its confusing me too
1615389114,thats why i asked about it here
1615389129,against BTC or $?
1615389134,$
1615389152,Btc is too erratic. Havent seen that chart in ages
1615389171,Although i think KAVA is btc only
1615389185,
1615389188,Nm
1615389295,this isnt making any sense at all
1615389303,am i meant to borrow the asset i want to buy
1615389306,Now I'm confused. Did I get 30x or 50x?
1615389308,and then repay it later
1615389315,"KAVA is on a slight uptrend, ENJ looks steeper.
Of course all the coins dropped last night (14 hrs ago) when BTC dipped. That's what alts do..."
1615389316,how do i set an order with that
1615389318,30x
1615389363,This is the same position
1615389389,"Oh, i meant from last year KAVA. Sort of a history repeats itself sort of thing. Like if accuracy is likely, then ENJ is at the green mark IMO"
1615389405,The fuck?
1615389413,Its like margin never likes me now 2 times in a row lol. Just as i sell there is a huge bump up @IllegalSkillsException
1615389441,I have been waiting for 56400 in BTC for 10 minutes. Eventually decide to sell at 56385. And then it bumps to 56500
1615389458,"550 now, i feel offended"
1615389497,It's because you sold. It does the same when I sell. We should coordinate one day and find out whose luck is worse.
1615389504,guys who does margine trading on Binance  if one can DM me.. i need help asap. bloody clock somehting.. and now cant find my monye to tranfser it back.. and here is no hystory in transactions.. nore my USDT balance in main wallet... i ether lost it as clicked somethig i should or its somewhere there need to be transfered back to main wallet
1615389521,@Jeremyfto
1615389549,But I only sold 5 dollar @ 125x. That shouldn't allow BTC to change
1615389571,like less than 0.003BTC
1615389575,lol
1615389619,I'm buying at 56200 again. Should hit it sometime later
1615389638,SKY is so low now damn
1615389670,I heard that's the limit?
1615389680,"Nah pluto, take the sky and moon wit you"
1615389699,if my money wasnt in this ENJ dip :p
1615389724,When did you invest? 1.8?
1615389734,Try again
1615389737,I woke up at 4
1615389744,and bought at 1.62
1615389755,If he invested at 1.8 it's your fault for relentless shilling :kekw:
1615389755,You're still in profit then arent you?
1615389773,I never said invest at 1.8
1615389785,1.8 was also a dip
1615389793,I had like 10 entry points :p
1615389794,Things become shilling when theres too much opposition and critisism.
1615389835,but I got completely kicked out yesterday in the dip around 1.67
1615389850,but there is so much resistance today to move up
1615389870,The day is always like this. Tends to move when japan is waking up
1615389899,yea it seems to pumps atleast once a day
1615389907,your $1 got liquidated?
1615389918,Its not pumping. Its getting used. Most of this is being used in Japan
1615389932,Nope made profit. Was just setting limit sells around 15%
1615389937,just because it was me trying it out
1615389958,"that's good, now you are ready for some $100 125x action lol 😄"
1615389975,100?!?! I already opened a 10k @ 125x on Doge
1615389984,lmao
1615389986,"damn you are ahead of me, im missing out all the gains"
1615389991,you just need one green candle then 😂
1615390001,then I would be a rich mofo
1615390015,So how much profit can you get betting 1€ on 125x ? 😆
1615390030,I just made 50 cents within 30 minutes on BTC
1615390032,125x whatever you would have gotten
1615390059,And worst case scenario?
1615390064,You lose the $1
1615390070,yes
1615390070,Sounds fishy
1615390075,I KNOW RIGHT
1615390077,👀
1615390088,you will get liquidated instantly I assume :p
1615390093,You know there is barrowing part there....doesent make me comfortable
1615390108,yeah if it drops even less than 1% you get liquidated lmao
1615390128,Just make sure you set a sell limit. Stops you from getting a 200k fine
1615390142,you can go negative lol?
1615390143,but on binance that actually can't happen because you only lose your $1
1615390148,"lmao, thats how u learn to get rich"
1615390150,Robinhood GME
1615390153,gotta get destroyed once
1615390162,but I don't have 200k lmao
1615390169,*yet*
1615390179,"yeah you dont go debt in Binance, you just lose your €1"
1615390188,which means ur ass got liquidated
1615390196,You know I have not failed a trade once in my short time as a investor & trader
1615390201,But liquidation fee?
1615390214,Just set a limit sell above the liquidation point
1615390222,then you pay normal limit sell price
1615390244,You can calculate the liquidation price beforehand
1615390252,I buy 10000000WIN and 100ETH
1615390350,Bad time to do that!
1615390361,fcking stupid people here
1615390386,what do you think cz will be announcing tomorrow?

1615390457,"So basically i put 10€  lets say 50x
Thats 500€
Price goes up 5% thats 25€ profit. I sell and walk away with that and in worst case scenario i lose my 10€
5% swings are quite common and in this example its over 200% profit or loss of initial investment ...

1615395538,😩 why doesn't swissborg support caaaaards
1615395584,Because btc is pumping
1615395598,yup. BTC pumping tends to cause alts to bleed
1615395613,Alts will follow once btc settles
1615395803,Such a stupid and inconsistent trend
1615395807,Fuck the market
1615395846,Thats basically prostitution
1615396543,Theta has been killin it lately
1615396576,What are the odds of a 20/30$ theta?
1615396600,"100 by the end of the year for theta, thats what im hoping for 🙂"
1615396609,gonna be holding on to theta for a while
1615396638,thats cap
1615396649,this is the first time ive seen alts bleed while btc poomps
1615396666,SKY has a great entry point yet again. not financial advice.
1615396689,Nah its always inconsistent
1615396698,"Sometimes they do, sometimes they pump also"
1615396703,ive been looking at the positions of all my alts and they are either bearish or too weird to determine a trend
1615396725,"Yesh the last part, very difficult to find a trend"
1615396741,How is it possible ??! Did you built a weak portfolio ?
1615396746,Hiiii all

1615398639,"no stop limit brother, I ride this wave"
1615398651,except of cz himself lol
1615398656,let me tell you a story
1615398670,dad started trading stock
1615398682,worked his way up to 70k
1615398691,put it into a natural gas company
1615398704,had no stop limit and liquidated his portfolio overnight
1615398711,😭
1615398714,BROOOO
1615398721,what happened after
1615398734,he stopped trading I guess
1615398740,stayed poor 🤷‍♂️
1615398762,When will it fly to the moon? @skycoin?
1615398809,good question
1615398815,can you leverage sky
1615398844,I think ENJ is about to explode
1615398849,lol
1615398851,I hope so
1615398855,Again?
1615398857,fudging ENJ 😂
1615398879,altho I probably got myself in this mess
1615398914,I have to say. It gave me some profit. I sold it almost 1£. It went 30p up more after lol
1615398929,I got like 4k out off ENJ
1615398939,but now I'm stuck in it
1615398954,Greed 😦
1615399053,If u got 4K out of it. U can’t be stuck lol or u went all in ?🤔
1615399072,I am now yea
1615399073,:p
1615399077,and I am in limbo
1615399082,and its not moving
1615399090,Im positive thogh it will go up at East to brake even
1615399107,I need to get to 17.5 and then I can exit
1615399113,1.75*
1615399133,and it got there already today and then it stalled
1615399278,WHO THE FUCK
1615399282,just pumped ACM
1615399284,LOOOOL
1615399295,my binance notifications went off like crazy
1615399296,All fan tokens pump
1615399307,Why tho
1615399325,nah it went from 12$ to 17$
1615399329,in like 10 sec
1615399348,50%
1615399565,How to catch these stuff damn
1615400574,"CHR sweeet
From 0.12 to 0.3 in few days"
1615400725,Thats tough
1615400798,ETH sort of on one place all day. 🤔
1615400811,Time to buy before it goes up up up ?:))
1615400878,I’m yet to own any of Eth 🙂
1615400948,I expect a drop or jump when it hits 2k
1615400951,probably a drop
1615400962,so maybe leverage it or future trade it w an oco?
1615401025,Need to look in to future and leverage. Maybe buy order for 1.5k in case it drops :))))
1615401043,"1,5k price I mean not funds lol"
1615401047,I don't think its going to hit 1.5k for a while if ever
1615401056,I might take my own advice tbh
1615401082,then again eth stagnates so much I would probably overleverage and slowly kill my position
1615401083,🤠
1615401280,If it goes to 2k it’s gonna go higher than that
1615401287,you guys think xem will fall more?
1615401306,Maybe it will need a couple of tries
1615401496,march is bearish month
1615401505,I think it drops :<
1615402172,
1615402259,Really bullish so far
1615402447,Right now im paying 40$ every 8 hours on my position
1615402457,Too many people longing and its killing me lol
1615402474,Hahaha
1615403257,@Jeremyfto how do I add to my margin
1615403264,On an existing leverage position
1615403289,Cause my maintenance balance is dropping and my maintenance margin is high
1615403301,And the margin ratio just keeps going up
1615403763,Still the same position you entered in the 1500s?
1615403864,how much you holding rn
1615403867,in $
1615403929,There should be a + next to your margin amount on your position
1615403933,unless you are doing cross
1615403952,"25 ETH which at 2k price is 50,000 USDT"
1615403963,Around 3800 margin
1615403969,no but i mean how much of your money
1615403971,you got there
1615404007,"3800 of my portfolios money. 1,200 of that is from fiat, 2600 is from the position itself"
1615404052,"Although I will say that at the beginning, I did lose 200$ and closed a position"
1615404064,"so technically from the 1500 position up, I was using 1k"
1615404087,I fucked a few positions earlier and lost a few bucks. but was trading 1-5 dollars at 125x lol
1615404121,Thanks for the intro into leveraging btw 🙂
1615404144,Anytime 🙂 Its one of the most enjoyable ways to trade IMO
1615404174,spot is boring once you get used to future leverage trading
1615404191,its more like gambling
1615404195,gambling is a game
1615404199,thus its enjoyable
1615404263,The USA covid relief bill passed.
1615404271,This is more like investing with margin as you can be strategic. I didnt throw my 1k at ETH for no reason. I analyzed the charts. Was there a chance it could have failed? yes. Is there a chance I can still lose all my money? Absolutely but the fun part about this vs actual gambing is you get to decide your risk tolerance
1615404272,Some big gains coming
1615404277,time to put a long on BTC
1615404286,They said they are going to try to get it out by the weekend too
1615404299,It technically hasnt passed yet but its basically passed
1615404302,Biden still has to sign it
1615404305,hes going to
1615404307,but he hasnt yet
1615404310,That's beautiful. Another green weekend!
1615404325,Ugh don't know what to do with the green money
1615404330,lol
1615404338,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/stimulus-update-house-passes-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-sends-to-biden.html
1615404340,and the best part is this will be a double green weekend for me
1615404346,I get the stim check too
1615404351,Haha
1615404354,"green on my crypto, green in my bank"
1615404366,the natives are sending me 500$ too
1615404367,"Well green weekend, but adjusted for inflation I wonder how much you actually get out of it"
1615404369,its green all over
1615404391,noooooooo
1615404394,you lost the rank!
1615404413,"I did a big cash out today, since Feb have made 35% total profit and transferred that into my long term holding"
1615404430,I am going to retire at 45
1615404441,Buy a boat
1615404445,And become a pirate
1615404480,THen get arrested and spend the rest of your life in prison as you will not be having any impact on society anymore anyways since you are retired
1615404662,😘
1615404686,BROO WTF
1615404697,since when was it 50k 💀💀
1615404712,I thought u were waiting till december for the Tesla
1615404729,unfortunately I dont get to keep that 50k. its leveraged
1615404734,but ill get to keep 9k of it
1615404737,Ohhhh
1615404745,That makes sense
1615404745,Thats still a nice chunk of change
1615404753,For a second I was like 👀
1615404761,I wish I got to keep all 50k
1615404775,If I got to keep all 50k Id get the tesla TODAY
1615404786,For real
1615404791,I was like
1615404797,Why u waiting till December
1615404801,Unless u want a model S
1615405136,I dont know if I can recreate these gains
1615405292,Making almost 10k from 1k is going to be insane enough
1615405303,turning 10k into 30k is going to be a challenge
1615405323,I should be able to do it
1615405341,but prob will take me that long to accomplish it
1615405357,You know what a fun goal could be for the long run. Earning enough money to pay off your parents' mortgage (if you still live at home :P)
1615405370,by the end of the year
1615405373,you be riding that tesla
1615405375,wildin'
1615405377,Thats possible if u have fat capital
1615405381,trust me
1615405388,My mom rents and my dad and step mom are top level execs so they have their house paid off already
1615405397,Yeah. If I earn 1 mil that is the first thing that I would do
1615405412,Oh I trust. Its just going to take careful planning
1615405413,Well then buy a house for yourself out of cash
1615405421,Yeah lol
1615405433,I like my apartment for the time being. Ill get a house eventually but tesla is higher prio
1615405446,"Worst case, you can live out of the tesla"
1615405454,plus my car is getting close the 150k mile mark
1615405463,I don't have a car atm lol
1615405467,I cycle everywhere
1615405470,So im prob going to need the tesla by the end of the year
1615405475,ya you cant cycle everywhere here
1615405486,it would take at least an hour for me to get to work cycling
1615406292,Electric bicycles are a thing :p
1615406311,They go pretty fast
1615406342,I dont live in the US
1615406353,But i feel like buying a house is a liability
1615406359,Unless its for rent
1615406370,But id rather buy a car than a house lol
1615406375,Maybe its stupid thinking
1615406380,Id rather rent an apartment
1615406394,Ye the stealth bombers are fuckin nutty
1615406401,2wd electric bikes
1615406406,buying a house is normally the same if not cheaper as far as mortgage to rent here in oklahoma but its 100% dependant on the state
1615406406,Do like 60mph
1615406411,I would not be getting a house in cali
1615406414,Is this frat chat or crypto only?! 😂
1615406417,I can't tell rn
1615406424,Hey

1615406780,I usually go all in on that
1615406863,There is some resistance on it tho
1615406952,"Yeah but once the support has been reached, it's max profits every time"
1615406952,Thats because you are using the wrong exchange. You have to use €LUBE / €ANAL
1615406964,are we about to see another BTC dip? hit peak about an hour ago again
1615406966,i trade on xxxchange
1615406983,I think so yeah its getting time for one
1615407008,Does the BUSD follow the USD?!?
1615407008,Still frat talk
1615407009,probs to around 55100
1615407034,"Thats inevitable, but this time it will have higher support"
1615407042,What’s your long term holding? A crypto or something else altogether?
1615407061,BTC & ETH
1615407106,Yeah the best stores of value for the next 10 years I imagine

1615407966,His last tweet was 2 days ago. You're welcome
1615407971,ye
1615407995,its just this eth fall is bugging me but we are getting close to a support/resistance zone at ETHBTC
1615408090,two days straight falling in that chart
1615408122,https://twitter.com/crypto_birb/status/1369737689646432256?s=12
1615408140,Whaaaaaat? Xrp 0???!?
1615408222,🤣
1615408291,i wish there was a channel for dumb newbs so i can ask stupid basic questions in it without cluttering up the crypto chat
1615408325,just ask here
1615408330,everything in one channel
1615408371,"If it's crypto related, it belongs here. And there are no stupid questions."
1615408383,Check #🔤crypto-101 #📈trading-101  if ur newb it can help also!
1615408648,Sign be in lol@
1615408870,Almost did the most stupid thing
1615408881,I was about to try ny first short at 25x
1615408887,But with 4$
1615408902,I got so mad it didnt hit my buy point by 3 cents
1615408912,I then went to the leverage calculator
1615408921,And saw how stupid of a trade it wouldve been
1615408940,It wouldve been worth 50 cents max
1615408943,💀💀
1615408953,Dont jump in without calculating kids
1615408992,lool
1615409008,that calculator is just there to make you invest more
1615409024,@Jeremyfto would you be able to explain basis risk to me
1615409087,did you used the calc poperly
1615409091,im reading that basis risk strengthening is beneficial for short hedgers but i dont understand why

1615409192,The sell difference from the buy difference was like -1.50%

1615410784,I want to be able to hover over BTC and control it
1615410789,How can i do this?
1615410792,@Cryptoknight tell me everything will be Allright please :’)
1615410799,I need some shilling
1615410820,lmao i am stupid. thanks
1615410849,Guyyys it happened phb on binance front page
1615410852,"I aint worried. I am scalping though, so the dip didnt really hit me"
1615410853,I had the same issue thats why I knew how to fix it. Its nnot super intuitive
1615410863,Off to the moon
1615410930,@kittiewitty Do a split between ENJ and BTC. You'll see what i mean
1615410958,
1615411462,u were right
1615411485,What can I say? Iv been enough partys to know what the correct amount of dip is 😉
1615411507,"If you are cheaping out with these gas station sized dips, I'm not even adjusting my position"

1615412140,u think phb will get a lot of interest because of this?
1615412159,id buy some but its only BTC and ETH pair or binance
1615412229,You see CHR is staked for ALICE it’s the same except PHB staked for HZN.
1615412292,Now you have an idea of the potential date
1615412611,Someone of you withdraw ever from letmybit.com 🤔? It is a Scam or Not !? Thank you in advanced 👍
1615412704,Anyone interested in ENJ - https://www.twitch.tv/bcdcdaz
1615413055,go dazz:)
1615413167,Great news on the casper sale
1615413181,They changed the supply on option 1 to 800m
1615413187,:kekw:
1615413192,is it good?:)
1615413199,thoigh less more:)
1615413220,also i hope i can grab some on sale. as it suppose untll stock last lol. first come first surved
1615413255,I think casper is a good project. But decide for yourself😉
1615413287,"by the way if anyone knows.. is Coinlist IP related as in, Ive registred for sale as resident non US canada and china, but I might be in county outside my residence for  days of sale..  would it be a problem? or need to leave someone  good  log ins to buy it for me:)"
1615413342,They doubled the supply bc it was the most registered sale on coin list so far
1615413413,sounds good! hopefuly it will be good one. I need to cover my reds:)  so far Swiss borg  loved me:)  the rest nahhh... though i hold some Ada and positive it will be green pasture for me in a few month or a year :))
1615413474,"You need to do a kyc, this contains proof of residence so i dont think this works"
1615413578,i did already. passport selfy and bill:)
1615413590,but i plan to be a way few days
1615413598,cant change days unfortunaly
1615413613,Yeah you can for option 1 if ik correct?
1615413666,ive registred for option 1 and 3
1615413680,Without proof residence?
1615413720,no all confirmed
1615414048,Enji to 70 dollars by may 🤔
1615414099,ye? mke it 100 🙂  dont be shy:)
1615414131,watching dazz lol
1615414297,Cool
1615414315,So that’s *35
1615414338,If I hold I will have 350k then in June
1615414358,Why would you not hold until June
1615414371,send him my regards:)
1615414435,Does he take into account the marketcap in his calculations?
1615414454,I can’t even talk myself into it 😦
1615414581,who cares markecap:)  u just got to believe in it!  no offence to dazz but he does seems a bit overly hopefull. mabe it will be 100 one day as rear coin for collectors.
1615414593,but if it gets 10 would be alrady WOW
1615414598,I'm very curious about BTCs next bigger dip
1615414625,Can't take that long at the pate it's gaining again
1615414692,but just setting realistic stop losses and worst case it sells somewhere in the future automatically
1615414705,but at least you don't lose money
1615414735,Stop losses are hard on such a volatile coin
1615414747,It has such huge swings
1615414784,I mean as soon as the bull run starts
1615414790,13% today beTween top and bottom
1615414793,now its not really realistic yeah
1615414808,If there ever will be a bull run again :p
1615414825,I read that bulls could push it to 2 and then sell off again
1615414827,true lol assuming some bull run will start forming soonish
1615414860,It does try sometimes

1615415579,16 right now.
1615415601,not sure why you want to join pumps
1615415607,there are less risky ways
1615415616,they are in essence still a scam
1615415621,"You can set sell limits immediately after buying. Won't scrape the top, but it's the safest method if you don't use unrealistic profit targets"

1615415988,I know how to ask for half a kilo of butter and whether you've done your homework in German
1615416102,I'm no longer interested in pumps at all – coins with some volatility and good volume work nicely with autotrader bots so I seek those atm
1615416398,Tausendfünfhundert is ne Menge Jeld
1615416415,Y'all think BTC might break it's ATH this push?
1615416436,"If not, then next one and so on"
1615416449,Question is if it will stay there
1615416464,Yes.

1615417463,very low activity still but finally the right direction

1615419682,Just btc attacking the resistance level
1615420699,I think phb will rocket March 22
1615420812,Why?
1615420858,I watched one video about them rebranding. I think it will go up. I just got 100$ worh of it 🙂
1615421139,Matic is listed on Coinbase tmrw so I thought it could be a catalyst
1615421248,Fingers crossed 🙂

1615421331,March 22 binance staking
1615421558,Getting closer…
1615421609,about to pump 1100 euro into binance. not sure if should buy BNB for storage until I make trade moves or just BUSD
1615421782,If you go for BUSD you won't lose anything
1615421799,if you go for BNB you will either gain a lot or lose a lot after the announcement
1615421811,yup
1615421831,I would go for BUSD
1615421845,"Still BNB is a great long-term, so you'd probably get it back soon"
1615421846,But maybe you like to take a larger risk with a chance of reward
1615421859,2 days is long term for me
1615421900,you could also speculate on a lower USD price due to the stimulus and keep your EUR as such before exchanging them
1615423707,thanks for reminding me of this
1615423721,hadn't thought to switch stores
1615423756,Maybe that doesn't happen. Nothing makes sense anymore in the market these days 👀
1615423782,Maybe that's just a red herring? Those dates are just comments that don't affect the script
1615423787,"(mmmh, herring)"
1615424497,@David R. the theta dip is there 👀
1615424567,I’m big sad buying in at $6.6
1615424583,I’m praying for another huge spike over the next coming days 🙏🏻😂
1615424948,OH GOD ITS HAPPENING
1615425182,so i should put 100$ on Matic?
1615425913,ouch
1615425915,ada
1615427035,:kekw:
1615427050,Nano going back to 5.5 so i am not complaining
1615428229,Yeah im gonba wait til tomorrow
1615428257,Hopefully btc crashes doen to39k
1615428680,I guess that would cause a few people here to get liquidated 👀
1615428716,eth 2k and THEN a market crash pls and thx
1615428821,any ideas whether matic has reached its bottom ahead of the coinbase listing?
1615428886,.34 to .28 is a big move. there's obviously still a bit of time before 9AM PT
1615428893,I'm trying to figure out the best entry here
1615428931,is matic a good coin to by rn?
1615428949,"getting listed on coinbase tomorrow at 9AM PT, 7PM GMT"
1615428952,it's gonna blow up
1615428964,just unsure whether it's gonna continue dipping before that time
1615429005,are you gonna future?
1615429021,"yup, that's why I'm wrapping my head around this"
1615429035,"wouldn't mind a higher leverage, but not one that will get me fcked"
1615429078,"1,5billion market cap"
1615429084,can easily go up imo
1615429088,absolutely
1615429125,the problem is btc crashing at the time
1615429149,btc is always a problem for altcoins sadly
1615429188,"btw, how much leverage do you want to use?"
1615429207,<= 10x
1615429216,"not more than 10, I think anything past 10 is too risky"
1615429229,places your liq price really close on these small priced coins afaik
1615429262,wheree does coinbase announcee listings?
1615429271,keep in mind matic will be very violatile when it gets listed
1615429285,and it may pump beyond the moon right before... and then it may crash after the initial listing
1615429294,so you'll have to be there right on time to monitor
1615429305,you mean when?
1615429316,"9AM PT, 7PM GMT"
1615429317,i mean like binance has an announcement page
1615429337,"oh, it will just get added to coinbase, doubt it's anything like binance's countdown"
1615429339,not sure tbh
1615429494,or you can just set a TP/SL and then you dont have to be right there
1615429538,usually the best way to go when dealing with major volatility. Sure you miss out on possible extra profits but its safer that way
1615429551,good point
1615429715,it's already making a move

1615443048,"Changpeng keeps delaying the ""announcement"" and seemingly hypes it up. Wonder what he is going to say"
1615443179,hostile takeover of the entire binance market
1615443199,"convert everything to bnb or else, cz exclaims"
1615443332,"hopefully, would boost the bnb i have haha"
1615443363,"$FET, fetchai. nice coin & cool project. wouldn't be surprised to see it moon soon."
1615446747,Didnt FET already moon?
1615446764,It already did *8 :p

1615449702,thank god I hit that ENJ sell order 😂

1615449772,"CZ Announcement, CZ continually hyping BSC on his twitter"
1615449801,Maybe time to tap into some BSC tokens!
1615449911,Thanks for this. Started the bot at a perfect time
1615450313,What??? Why?
1615450326,Enj did good yesterday
1615450332,/today
1615450397,because I had sales order a 1.75 and 1.775
1615450405,and I can rebuy in a dip again now
1615450412,Ahhh. Good call
1615450440,Risky though. Could have very well gone up and stayed up
1615450456,every sell is a gamble :p
1615450469,Life is a gamble.
1615450487,but when it reaches 2dollar there will a be huge sell
1615450493,so thats the current top I think
1615450502,Walls eaten up fast now.
1615450505,(not saying it can again rise after that sell)
1615450517,Hope some Ethiopian kid is not reading this.
1615450521,but the sell wall is like 600k at 2 :p
1615450549,but ok man

1615450563,Me too 😫
1615450612,"The last time I said eh fuck it I'll buy the dip, it went from 1.36 to 1.7 and never came back down. Same sell walls were there then."
1615450638,yea when it pumps; it really pumps 😂

1615451918,providing that BTC doesnt dump further
1615451969,"IF the Announcement is something super boring, I'm hoping to get some more BNB out of my ENJs"
1615452543,"Delightful#6962 spam in md >:c win giveway
@Delightful
is bot?
or account"
1615452639,"Thing is, since it was whitelisted for use as an in-game cryptocurrency in Japan less than two months ago, ENJ is now a real world usage coin and there are dozens of games using it and more are announced frequently. So I'm not really expecting it to go stagnant. It doesn't only exist in traders' wallets, it's also virtual things & characters inside games."
1615452653,HELP ME IN
1615452657,HELP PLEASE
1615452659,NO IGNORE
1615452668,what do you want?
1615452673,that the account is banned?
1615452867,"Also, this ""nft craze"" that I see mentioned that's also surrounding enj… If any crypto trader thinks nft is about selling unique gif's or such then they're not very clear on the fundamentals and the possibilities"
1615453777,Swiss abit down. Wonder if it will go 1.2 again
1615453914,"im closly watching it.  got 100  more of it yesterday. im positive it will keep stable and  go back up and up up up. They have safety thing, to burn tokens and buy back token to preserve price, if I understood it correct.  Also ETH bit down.. I dont know if it make sense, but Eth down so and  Swiss with it as its ETH based of what ever...:p"
1615453951,can you tell me a coin that is not down? :p
1615454051,Psg
1615454260,Am i the only one here on CHR train?
1615454277,The coin made 400% in 2 days
1615454688,400% why im not on the train lol
1615454780,Too late to jump on I guess
1615454934,SYLO 😀
1615455755,I believe it can go much higher
1615455967,"I bought it when it was 0.16 its over 0.41 now
Coin is connected with nft hype, the same thats partially driving ENJ
If ENJ can gi from under 0.6 to 1.7 in warpspeed .....
Crazy times. Every other altcon could flip and fall aswell so im not giving any financial advise. Its just good to jump on hype and get some quick profits"
1615456157,U understand. Not planing to hodl it 🙂
1615456704,"I will Hodl ENJ though😆 
I believe in the coin, even if there could be a correction in the future it will inevitably recover. It has one major benefit - its being implemented for practical use. Thats something not every shitcoin has"
1615456882,I’m sure it will go up slowly but steady until new ENj take over. But even then Enj will be rare coin to have 🙂 for gamers or something
1615457293,"Maybe someone experienced here has done some reseaech on CHR?
Has it long term potential or should i jump off the train before it rides off a cliff
Im not mister paper hands so im prepared to hodl through wind and storms"
1615457631,I am mister paper hands :p
1615457639,I am happy with 20% to move one
1615457762,"Haha, yeah but than there is always that bitter feeling when the coin rockets further when you have jumped off"
1615457788,+ you have to find another rising coin to make profits off
1615457856,"you can always wait for the coin to go down a bit and enter again if the forecast is overall good, then you hold until another rocket jump"
1615457978,10-20% is quite easy on crypto coins
1615457989,you dont need a coin rocketing for that
1615457995,look at the swings that FET makes
1615457996,true!
1615458011,its can go up 5% in a 15min candle :p

And Enjin are really far with building the networks to power all that stuff"
1615458037,if you can make 20% every trade consistently ud be a millionaire within the year
1615458039,easy
1615458046,I aim for 2% a day tbh :p
1615458057,Damn I should probably go get Enjin stock
1615458082,actually im curious
1615458083,is enjin the biggest player in NFTs?
1615458089,Yes at the moment
1615458090,"20% every day, starting with 10 dollars"
1615458095,for a whole year
1615458146,"yeah it'd be really difficult to have consistent 20% profit, cuz papa bitcoin could drop at any point and take you down on whatever coin you're in trade"
1615458152,so you'd have to calculate some minor losses there
1615458153,lol
1615458160,in the millions I think lol
1615458167,yea
1615458169,not even close
1615458194,164x ur value every month
1615458220,2 months is already in the 200k range
1615458311,imma enter long enj I think
1615458314,it's kinda smiling
1615458329,just expect a big drop back when it hits 2 I think
1615458350,"oh yeah I'd probably close at 1.8-1.9, not go too crazy"
1615458365,it hit 1.81 again this night
1615458374,instantly dropped back :p
1615458438,"I did miss out my entry this morning, bummer"
1615458458,hmmm
1615458461,enj or matic
1615458467,I guess I could 50/50 both
1615458498,I think I'll just paper-hand out as soon as it's green again and then buy in again at a lower rate
1615458536,not always that easy to time
1615458544,yesterday I thought I bought the dip
1615458553,before I knew I was -1.5k in te minus lol
1615458578,"before I know is perhaps an overstatement, was 10 hours later :p"
1615458600,you don't use stop losses?
1615458603,or did you forget
1615458613,cuz I do sometimes and I hate myself for the rest of the day
1615458618,until the coin goes back up
1615459363,Heared from friends that BNB gets recommended everywhere rn
1615459388,Think we're about to start something big again  this month
1615459422,well CZ has that announcement coming up so probably
1615459478,This better be a banger
1615459543,🙂 time to buy BNB? or CZ?:P)))
1615459545,4 hours
1615459559,Either BNB will hard dip or skyrocket
1615459567,CZ is the binance owner guy
1615459571,not a coin lol
1615459592,If it hard dips I'll just restock
1615459612,🙂
1615459647,ENJ is so volatile
1615459654,where do you put your stop losses
1615459659,and dips it bounces back so fast
1615459683,so worst case you put it on the end of the candle and it shoots back 4% directly and you are stuck
1615459703,"As bitcoin is going to become more relevant over the year, Binance will gain a ton of users. Which ultimately means 🚀BNB 🚀"
1615459750,Put that money on  table
1615459759,Yum
1615459800,Hoping for 0.5% of americans pumping it into btc. That would be 5 billion
1615459839,actually i wonder how many people believe in cryptocurrency around the world
1615459874,%2
1615459881,Most people get it wrong in my opinion
1615459898,its not cryptocurrency but blockchain tech I guess
1615459904,yes
1615459907,not every coin is perse a currency
1615459918,They wanna invest into crypto as long as it goes up and don't care anymore when it goes down
1615459923,Only %2 of earth owns bitcoin and shitcoins
1615459932,Thinking it's dead or something
1615459935,that was what i meant
1615460033,"im totally sure if nothing comes in the future, blockchain can easily be the invention of the century"
1615460081,btc making a move potentially
1615460100,cmon enj follow
1615460128,"hour candle closing in 5, btc has a fat one stacked rn"
1615460131,could be a nice breakout
1615460143,Let’s hope
1615460255,"it makes me pissed that altcoins almost always keep the same value with btc going for example 20% up, but then btc down 0.00001% and alts drop a lot"
1615460272,Either a whole Bitcoin/ shitcoin or a part of a Bitcoin/ shitcoin? 😮
1615460284,DUDE!!! This is the one thing I hate about all of this
1615460292,btc needs to be stable for alts to do stuff :p
1615460300,"exactly what you just described man, it drives me INSANE"
1615460311,"like look, btc is shooting to the moon, enj is like 0.00% change"
1615460323,"btc drops $100, enj -30%"
1615460324,WTF
1615460332,or any other altcoin for that matter
1615460335,some coins even drop when btc going up
1615460343,was gonna buy chr to stake at 16cent.. it going stupid nearly 50cent now..
1615460368,Both btc and altcoins
1615460379,"Isn’t it just random? Like yeah generally there will be an increase in altcoin price in relation to BTC going up, but for the most part isn’t it random or am I big dumb?"
1615460390,its always
1615460398,BTC takes the money when pumping
1615460405,CHR had a really quick rise to 48c then back under 47c lol. Was so fast
1615460409,and people panic sell when BTC is dumping
1615460419,Oh
1615460422,yup btc is going
1615460433,hopefully someone got in off that call
1615460437,might have been a little too late
1615460438,chr gotta stop at some point right? xD
1615460446,but it was before the 1h candle closed at least lul
1615460507,now I'm afraid for my enj long when this btc bullrun eventually gets whaled on
1615460509,fack
1615460510,"idk where, but i saw in a video a guy talking that altcoins panic sell are mostly from bots because people who have them are mostly holders"
1615460536,makes sense but idk if thats true
1615460559,yea ofcourse
1615460562,yess enj
1615460568,letsgoooo
1615460571,the big candles are bots I would assume :p
1615460602,Hope not lol. Jumped on at 44c
1615460623,😬
1615460639,Feels like it breaks 50c in the next 30mins though.
1615460654,volume facking low as my balls rn
1615460656,cmon enj
1615460658,A lot of volume going into it
1615460681,it aint stopped since the alice staking was announced lol
1615460685,has to pull back soon
1615460692,What wallet is that for Alice staking
1615460701,binance launchpad thing
1615460736,i decided to stake in bnb.. could have bought chr at 16c an staked that
1615460750,"As soon as CHR breaks through 49, I reckon it’ll be quick to get to 50"
1615460774,There’s 49 lol

1615460841,tellin me that aint gonna have some nasty pull back xD
1615460854,"Nah, she’ll be right"
1615460880,Why such pump 700% on CHR last few days?
1615460881,Anyone joining the Okex pump tomorrow?
1615460896,binance launchpad and hype around gaming coins i guess
1615460988,"As a challenge for myself, I put in $50 to try and turn it into $500"
1615461011,need to stop watching it lol the fact i coulda bout a 16 cent daunting on me xD
1615461040,"Don’t worry, it’s profit"
1615461063,Oh wait you didn’t buy in sorry
1615461066,wish my bag of vet would do the same xD
1615461070,:kekw: more red pls
1615461078,no pls
1615461083,i mean i got bnb staking for alice so alice can pump when it lists
1615461094,enj pulled back bcuz btc showed red for 0.3 seconds. ffs
1615461104,I swear I'm gonna start trading btc only
1615461107,I want to see -30 across the board
1615461109,:kekw:
1615461110,this altcoin crap is pissing me off
1615461143,Altcoins are gr8
1615461153,I mean they are..
1615461164,"Ahh damn it, people selling it now since it broke 50c"
1615461176,Was hoping to get a quick sale at 50.2c
1615461180,i hope bitcoin getting overwhelmed by any other coin in a near future
1615461191,that would be the day
1615461203,Never gonna happen
1615461221,Adoption by another coin is more  possible
1615461250,yeah gotta have a few hours down soon i think
1615461269,i think it will be like the steam engine
1615461287,I’ll probably just sell at 49.6c and then sit on the pullback
1615461292,Buy back around 45-46
1615461298,What coin?
1615461304,you got your shopping list ready? 😄
1615461310,Ofcourse
1615461311,CHR
1615461315,CHR at 0.5 already jeeesus christ

1615461332,I want nano to hit 5 bucke so can buy 200 bucks more

1615461389,nice lol its on thin ice rn its gotta cool off abit you would think
1615461442,Might have to find another alt coin now to have a play in
1615461443,I took out a tiny bit when it reached 0.45 was expecting to put it back when it drops a bit.....this shit never drops for fuck sake
1615461485,it has to have a red day soon just look at the stonk its got on

1615463946,I often am
1615463965,Matic hasn’t changed much
1615463970,THETA just broke $7 and I’m very happy although people set sell orders at that so I only saw it for a split second 😂
1615463979,is skl the best one to buy because its low market cap?
1615463996,I'm getting matic and skl
1615464006,"enj is not moving at all while btc is skyrocketting. I think I should exit... when btc corrects, enj will drown"
1615464021,CHR is on the verge of going red candle
1615464033,"Currently I have a tp at 0,61 for skl. If it reaches that and dips afterwards, I'll get more"

1615464702,i think it's dipping now
1615464713,perfect time to add more?
1615464769,From the graph it looks like a good time to buy
1615464778,Not as experienced as others though
1615464862,you already got your HBAR stack ?
1615464879,"No lol, I haven’t bought in"
1615465088,CHR is finish or do you think its going more up?
1615465207,I should just go out I think
1615465209,:p
1615465230,rarely works out for me 😂
1615465409,"Tough one. It feels like there’s enough volume going around to make it likely to keep moving, but no telling whether the whales are just trading it hard"
1615465552,which pump is going today 20:00 gmt?
1615465556,Is it a good time to buy Ada ?

1615465607,CHR dropping now hard lol
1615465659,I cant decide if i should have 50% in ada and 50% in xrp or all in one
1615465669,i have now 50% 50%

1615465749,could keep going or could cool of for few days
1615465882,still holding enj long

1615465924,@That one belgian super cunt  is that what you bought?
1615466001,"Fark, held onto CHR too long. Will have to hope I sell it at 60c again in the next 24hrs"
1615466022,HBAR starting to move now
1615466118,remeber i said fomo decisions arnt good 😆  look at the bigger picture and you might fomo in less lol
1615466152,having a bit of patience pays off
1615466158,Lol I’m still in profit regardless
1615466177,If it gets back up to 60c it’s 20% profit for my initial investment
1615466190,well dont hold on to it all the way down
1615466202,key word 'IF'

1615466270,well the aim is to make money right?
1615466309,fuck bogs
1615466313,"Of course, but if I lose a little on this, it’s not the end of the world. Can’t have big attachments to the money we invest"
1615466338,but you can be smart with it
1615466345,thats all
1615466371,I think you’re mistaking the context in which I put this money in lol
1615466403,i aint arsed mate
1615466409,"It’s more fun money to try and build it up. If it’s a slight loss today, no problem. I’ll have fun investing in something else tomorrow"

1615466833,bought into STC the other day
1615466920,Oof was just the right time to sell all my small altcoins and go back heavy on btc/eth/bnb
1615467146,for some reason that link doesn't always work. here's another https://studentcoin.app
1615467289,I'm going to wait a bit to see if that spike is sustainable before going back in HNT
1615467466,More more
1615467481,+%80 almost compared to yesterday
1615467492,nice
1615467500,but keep in mind that it is only a gain once you have realised it
1615467509,i've already taken out half
1615467511,at 52
1615467515,now i wait for 1$
1615467666,only things green in my favorites are btc and enj 🤔
1615467720,ENJ is red for me lol
1615467730,only BTC is green from the 24 pairs I follow :p
1615467756,Swissborg is green :kekw:
1615467779,swissborg is not gambling enough
1615467789,doesnt fit my rich or rekt filosofy
1615467809,HBAR looking like it’s on a roll now too. 2c the last 30-40mins

1615469648,BNB approaching the 300 mark again
1615469860,So at what time is SUSHI announced on Coinbase?
1615470198,Matic going up 🙂 thanks for mentioning it. I’m 20$ up 🙂
1615470621,anyone keeping an eye on BNB? 🚀
1615470987,What price should I fix my tp with sushi ?
1615471249,Matic go go go 🙂
1615471335,Yup. You need to watch in in one hour
1615471983,skl for 0.62 is a good buy?
1615472107,ENJ making a move
1615472138,"took a bit, but waiting for it was worth it"
1615472147,"it just started, may not be too late"
1615472172,will probably test 1.81 and maybe even pass it
1615472174,at least I hope
1615472179,🤞
1615472334,thanks btc.
1615472335,dick.
1615472346,Having tough time deciding whether to get more enj with all my bnb 😅
1615472363,waited all day for enj's break
1615472370,and btc comes and poops right when it starts
1615472373,just my shit ass luck
1615472375,fuck me
1615472621,"slightly annoying indeed, sir!"
1615472646,thats like what ENJ does all the time
1615472653,go up and then instantly down :p
1615472670,the big push is mostly my night time for some reason
1615472682,"sure, but it didn't reach the full potential of the run, btc literally pooped itself and all other coins with it right at the same time"
1615472716,what do you mean by this?
1615472906,when is the #skycoin pump
1615473191,thats its seems to be in the Japan morning time if you look at the graph
1615473220,ahhh yeah you're probably right
1615473230,When you say in japan hours  🧐
1615473237,coming back now
1615473243,just cum already
1615473274,Anyone staking Alice?
1615473349,Does staking mean the same as holding?
1615473370,which day ?
1615473390,"Yes and no, it's on the Binance Launchpad"
1615473526,bitcoin can you chill tf out
1615473543,let enj have a moment you selfish fuck
1615473563,it goes again and btc AGAIN pulls down
1615473677,take a xanax bitcoin
1615473693,??????
1615473738,I feel like most of the pumps happen between like 23-5 GMT time
1615473754,but they are always short in nature :p
1615473759,a peek of 15 min
1615473771,i think that guy is here looking for group pumps
1615473776,"you know, the stinky shit"
1615473780,oh ok
1615473786,yea its not like that lol
1615473859,i will join the skycoin pump
1615473894,"enj still managing to go up while btc is still pooping, nice 😄"
1615473900,keep it up ay
1615473900,when?
1615473909,Whats the opinion on ESS? They have a master node option that costs about $1k to start and supposedly pays 160%
1615473915,"HEX coin supposedly pays around 40% right now, heard some shady stuff about it but people seem to be making money. Anybody here have direct experience with it?"
1615473952,I'm looking for pump time too
1615473967,"i have seen some news regarding ETH miners going against eip-1559 on april 1st by transfering hash power to a single pool for 51 hours... i'm not well informed, but a friend of mine says that it could cause some massive crash. What do you think about it?"
1615473992,very likely
1615474028,"I mean, I think eth guy really undermines miners and undervalues their presence and how much they made eth what it is today"
1615474048,the moment miners are out of the picture... oof.
1615474093,"nvm, there goes enj"
1615474097,btc is dumping harddddddd
1615474111,goddamnit
1615474185,It is said that there is a pump on March 13? #skycoin ?
1615474234,I dont do / follow scam pumps
1615474256,I buy coins that are low and hope that they regain momentum :p
1615474294,smart
1615474316,I've been waiting for a long time to sell
1615474331,can the ENJ whales just wait a little bit for btc to settle down and continue pretty please? 😄
1615474344,I'm epicly failing today
1615474348,I bought it hoping it will rise but it keeps falling
1615474375,"I'd say the same but I'm still in profit, but it's far less than what I expected by now after waiting a whole day"
1615474379,its only been falling for a day?
1615474387,I bought it this morning
1615474399,on a USDT level its break even I think :p
1615474427,I bought skybtc
1615474431,bitcoin. bitcoin. will you stop you asswipe
1615474444,It has been falling steadily for 1 month
1615474447,yea well I need a crash tbh
1615474452,we have conflicting interests 😂
1615474455,hahahahah
1615474459,that's okay 😛
1615474462,i need a crash too
1615474463,often eating small pump
1615474465,"you cheer for your side, I'll cheer for mine"
1615474470,so i could put in some
1615474475,that i dont have
1615474498,If you have 100$ and want to take it out tomorrow. Where should i put it? I have an experiement lol
1615474502,i'm gonna be millionaire with 20€
1615474537,👍
1615474777,"i have a little on eth now, more than i have on btc, but i'm unsure if to sell or to hold..."
1615474979,IMO hold.
1615474988,Where is that damn announcement
1615475029,"afraid of this, now i started seeing memes of it"
1615475060,"and when there are memes, the thing is serious 🤣"
1615476093,chz blasting to outer universe
1615476096,EVERYTHING BUT ENJ
1615476099,my luck today
1615476111,I want to twist my asshole right now
1615476288,😮
1615476313,OH SHIT
1615476315,ENJ GOING AGAIN
1615476323,BITCOIN I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU INTERRUPT IT FOR THE 3RD TIME
1615476525,Does btc and enj counteract each other?
1615476536,Opposite movements?
1615476743,OMG
1615476746,BITCOIN AGAINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
1615476748,ok.
1615476749,I'm done.
1615476756,FFS
1615476765,seriously guys you can't argue this
1615476773,this is the 3rd time now
1615476845,Everything dropping
1615477161,"ENJ is unusually unrelated to BTC, which admittedly dazzz has been going on about for a while"
1615477410,Seems it's hitting $1.80 soon
1615477464,Could it be because ENJ can be earned through the games rather than just being traded on an exchange?
1615477578,Lmao what happened to CHZ?
1615477607,people taking mass profits
1615477777,Should I sell my stuff ?
1615477798,Im like 1% down should we expect a bigger crash
1615477829,That’s the theory rn
1615477867,anyone in on HOGE? huge gains so far
1615478802,hi what do you think about TCT ?
1615478822,When does sushi are available on coinbase ?
1615479339,Don’t remember
1615479590,run up to coinbase listing has begun for matic
1615479598,it's getting listed in 40 mins from now
1615479629,not sure if it will reach the hype peak at the time of the listing or shortly after
1615479749,"if someone has witnessed a coinbase listing before, please share the experience"
1615480137,I have 1k matic. Never got anything before listing.   Best to sell right before ? Or after ? Lol it’s +20$ up for me alrady
1615480173,I would expect an initial spike up
1615480185,after getting listed?
1615480196,assuming because coinbase community will be snatching it up?
1615480200,But considering everybody already know it will fall quickly
1615480213,Maybe I’m totally wrong
1615480235,does coinbase even matter don't they just have their own supply?
1615480251,i doubt when you buy from BTC that they first buy stuff from a exchange and then send it to you
1615480268,so they should of already bought a couple million USD worth of the new coins
1615480277,which is probably the big rise before a listing
1615480287,Btc is trying again
1615480293,If it fails i’m scared
1615480300,*should have
1615480322,a german being a grammar nazi.

1615480410,
1615480436,@SeineJanie what's your take on matic and coinbase?
1615480447,"sorry, still busy with fkn OVH fire"
1615480452,LOL
1615480466,what of yours was affected?
1615480588,lol how are you affected?
1615480623,he may have lost everything that he hosted on the burned servers
1615480643,hopefully he had a backup tho
1615480692,If a host service doesnt have back ups then they are a shit service
1615480712,yea would be strange if they didnt replicate to an other site
1615480714,depends on what kind of service you are using
1615480715,"COS/BTC easy money right now rumoured pump at 5pm , 22mins away"
1615480792,:kekw:
1615480817,Sure thing for pump organizers lol
1615480829,"i heard from minecraft server owners that some server blew up because they had backups, but on the same site (backup for game crashes, not for actual server crash)"
1615480861,so they lost everything because they didnt have off-site backups
1615480881,yea but thats minecraft
1615480885,not business data
1615480900,"Long story short: Customer of ours had a production site in SBG2, which burnt to the ground. Off-site backup latest was Feb 17. So we're basically rebuilding from scratch and re-piecing bit by bit. Making progress though."
1615480919,"minecraft was one example, but it's a business application like others, if you run a server for money"
1615480966,"it's not just ""site hosting"""
1615480972,"That's the thing. Off-site backups are expensive, so they don't do it daily. Maybe the last daily was in one of the other datacenters in SBG, but connection is still not regained although SBG3 and SBG4 seem to be undamaged and operational. But they can't wait until Monday or Tuesday to access the backup."
1615481016,that sucks man
1615481018,"By chance an admin made a database dump from the day before 😄
Still a lot of work to rebuild it"
1615481118,"I still have STL and MATIC. STL is going to reach my tp before 5pm, MATIC I'll keep to see what happenes"
1615481122,you mean its not a single click :kekw:
1615481165,Btc for the 4th time couldn’t keep 57k
1615481197,"ENJ just crossed 1,85 for a brief moment"
1615481201,My alts are bleeding
1615481238,Enj is looking good
1615481505,@Jeremyfto What would u reccomend i do my first 100$ future on today?
1615481575,$2.4 tonight
1615481607,#NFA
1615481615,I’m also positive it will go up
1615481686,I personally would put your 100$ into something you normally would go for anyways on spot. Market has been weird lately with BTC going up and down so much. Normally Id recommend ETH but its not doing great rn so I'd just mirror what you would do on spot trading!
1615481701,So ENJ?
1615481705,they do have ENJ futures if you believe its going to go up!
1615481715,It already looks pretty green today tbh
1615481734,"Thing is, i dont know how it works. Is here a timeframe?"
1615481741,Nope
1615481744,Its perpetual
1615481756,"you can keep it as long or as short as you want. Keep it 5 minutes, keep it 5 months"
1615481778,OOooooo. Are you saying i could have invested in that instead of ENJ directly?
1615481783,Yep!
1615481802,"So long is up and short is down, right?"
1615481807,Yep!
1615481816,What about REALLY long for ENJ?
1615481819,Pick a small leverage please
1615481833,Wait what? Whats this?
1615481841,Like a 3x
1615481841,The 3x 5x?
1615481852,Don’t go 20x if it’s your first time
1615481854,What happens if i pick 125x?
1615481856,I always recommend 2-5x for your very first few futures trades
1615481867,then move it up when you feel comfortable with how it works
1615481868,your ass belong to binance
1615481878,Your ass is gonna get fucked
1615481899,I thought u cant be in debt
1615481904,You cant
1615481917,They are basically just saying you will lose all your money
1615481925,So how does my jmetaphorican ass belong to binanass
1615481971,"The only thing thats important to note is you do pay a fee on what you own and its based on how many OTHER people have futures position. For example I currently am paying 0.0991% every 8 hours on my margin. Keep in mind you arent paying a fee on the borrowed crypto, just on the money you have in"
1615481988,"so if you have 3k in at 10x, you wont be paying the fee on 30k, just the 3k"
1615482018,Do you also pay a fee for unused margin?
1615482045,If you mean added margin then yes
1615482057,You pay a fee on even the added margin that brings your liq down
1615482075,what have you done lmao
1615482081,you have unleased the mega white knight now
1615482083,"Ok. Too fast for me. So what do i do? First i open a margin account, add $100 of USDT. Then select 3x or whatever and go Long on ENJPerpetual. Correct?"
1615482085,thats why its recommended to max remove your removable margin right before the countdown timer ends to minimize fee cost
1615482091,matic seems unaffected
1615482104,interesting
1615482106,You are going to want to do a futures account not a margin account
1615482108,Very ironic conisdering my reply to Jeremy
1615482110,that's the one thing I didn't expected
1615482113,still says unavailable on coinbase
1615482114,is that correct?
1615482115,I thought we'd see a pump or a dump
1615482119,Woah.
1615482128,oh hmmm
1615482134,Gona sale half of my matic. It’s still up since morning
1615482135,Maybe it's cuz I'm on a vpn idk
1615482136,Ill send you the link to ENJs futures account
1615482140,I only have these on ENJ
1615482141,good idea

1615482155,because you are on margin
1615482159,not futures
1615482167,I just sent you the link to futures
1615482175,So margin is the one where im taking a loan
1615482177,eight?
1615482200,Where?
1615482203,Oh. Nm
1615482208,dropping
1615482219,Both are loans but margin is a loan you have to manually repay
1615482227,future's loan is attached to the position
1615482230,I recommend futures
1615482232,Ok then. Fuck margin.
1615482253,Whats cross collateral?
1615482285,I don't know what to think about the state of eth right now. Any comments ?
1615482293,Sold@half still over 10$ plus.
1615482316,Whats the minimum i can do. Super uncomfortable right now. So will just simmer the water firist
1615482322,If you believe in ENJ so much just 125x it
1615482333,This damn thing just broke my brain
1615482343,@Jeremyfto is that correct?
1615482344,LETS GOOO
1615482352,I'm a believer. Not an idiot
1615482360,Lol I’ve tried the other day too.
1615482361,The minimum you can do is 1 ENJ
1615482373,Going to figure MF out and make x5 more money 🙂
1615482376,That is almost correct
1615482376,Ah ok. So with like $25 or so.
1615482386,@Cryptoknight are you longing ENJ?
1615482391,you pay fee on the margin 4 numbers to the right
1615482394,That's a solid dump. 👀  I market sold my matic just before it crossed the entry point. And made a nice profit on selling skl before the full hour 😄
1615482400,Might. havent decided yet what i want to loose $25 on yet
1615482404,you dont pay a fee on whats in your futures account
1615482410,same here 🙂 well done!
1615482420,I wont long ENJ right now though. Pretty sure it will fall back a bit. It will pump again in about 8 hours
1615482432,on that one?
1615482436,Yep!
1615482441,Where do you think ENJ will be by like end of week
1615482447,Not trolling legit curious
1615482459,25$ is a decent amount to test the waters
1615482467,is this definitely some sort of rule at this point?
1615482471,how dare you
1615482472,I tried to limit sell but it plummeted too fast. Good thing there's an ejection seat for when the emergency brake fails  😄
1615482497,for sure!
1615482572,SUSHI is actually gaining solidly since 1 hour ago
1615482585,next time buy the one I'm not getting 😄
1615482587,matic recovering
1615482590,overall decent
1615482593,cmon ENJ push!
1615482607,ENJ heading for an all time high
1615482621,think it's gonna reach it?
1615482626,that'd be like $2
1615482627,big one
1615482627,i have 19 usdt
1615482633,what should i yolo on
1615482635,hmmm
1615482636,"short ENJ at 1,95?"
1615482649,hard to tell sadly :/
1615482653,if it doesn't reach ath now
1615482659,maybe tonight when asia is up
1615482690,matic recovering really gud
1615482711,wouldn't
1615482728,nafa
1615482754,Dont mess with ENJ right now. Could go anywhere with BTC volumes all over the place
1615482778,👀
1615482783,What a big sell wall at 1.93
1615482796,Im not worried about 1.93. Im worried about 2.1
1615482802,Is this coordinated I wonder
1615482807,Sold half. Now waiting to sell half of other hal. And the rest will live on sale other 0.50 lol
1615482814,That they can just destroy all sell walls so fast
1615482889,MATIC moving now
1615482893,I wonder why the 3 coinbase-candidates behave so extremely different
1615482907,No. It's the servers updating shit that people do in games and nfts
1615482929,Always at the same time everyday twice
1615482956,matic ath soon
1615482957,goddamn
1615482965,reached
1615482991,What a run for tfuel
1615483041,Does anyone have an idea why the 3 coins that started trading on coinbase at 5pm (MATIC SKL SUSHI) behave extremely different on Binance? Is that related to the listing on coinbase? What can we learn from that for the next time? @Post Grad
1615483142,I backed out from enj for now
1615483148,it's struggling for too long for my taste
1615483150,I made 8$ on MATIC. Could have been 100$ 😦
1615483155,not sure if bulls have the advantage
1615483162,I could be wrong ofc
1615483176,"Hand me your crown @Cryptoknight , I am the king of paper hands now. :virgin:"
1615483188,I just now I’m having a week full off bad decisions :p
1615483190,"I just got so burned so many times when I would just sit and wait while it stagnates and holds, it ends up always dropping on me 😦"
1615483193,so I backed out
1615483194,"I can't speak entirely about the difference in markets BUT from my past experience with coinbase, they inflate purchase price quite a bit especially with fiat. I remember trying to buy ETH at 1700 and their charts showed 1700 but the quote I got was like 1780 and they throw a fee on top of that"
1615483239,you can see this happen when you try to make a purchase on the charts page. Type how much you want and then press see more and the price you are buying at will be inflated from THEIR OWN charts
1615483262,I'm only trading on Binance though
1615483267,Its literally scummy af so I buy from coinmama now. Its just a funnel for currency to Binance anyways
1615483305,Hoping for enj to cover up my dumb decisions today
1615483368,"@Jeremyfto So just to clarify, an example

I put $100 into a futures thing at $1 value per coin at 5x. Going long. 
If the coin goes down to $0.8, I get liquidated.
If it goes up to $1.2, then I can sell and my $100 at $200.

Is this correct?

Also, cross collateral is like if a man wants to dress up as a woman at the expense of his manhood. He doesn't HAVE to do it, but doing it ensure that u don't get liquidated until your manhood is completely gone. Correct? Also, u can decide how much of your manhood is at stake. You can simply wear women's clothing, or add a pushup bra, or take the ultimate plunge into chopping off your dick. This will secure u from liquidation. Right?"
1615483386,Naw. One mistake doesn't count for that
1615483586,I highly recommend avoiding cross collateral. Cross collateral is only if you dont want to convert other cryptos into USDT. You will be paying a 0.65% daily fee ON TOP of the funding fee so you will more than likely be looking at close to 1% loss a day. Your math is correct on the liq vs 200% though
1615483607,"at 1$ a coin 5x, your liq is 0.8 and your 2x is 1.2"
1615483626,Yeah. Wasnt planning to. Sounds like margin again
1615483660,]You're right. Someone is fucking with this
1615483667,Keep in mind these are estimates. There is an added maintenance margin in play as well but its not large. 2x leverage on btc 50k was liq of 25100$
1615483684,so instead of 25000 your liq is 25100
1615483684,I also sold SKL way too early and could have made 100$ more on that 😦 so annoying
1615483715,Must resist buying ENJ right now
1615483721,"very close to the same number but not the exact. To get an exact liq price, you can use binances calculator above the place order screen"
1615483759,Same
1615483761,"so basicaslly kanye was right? Red buy, green sell?"
1615483772,FOMO has been hard with ENJ
1615483773,no no no no no
1615483785,it will fall again.
1615483791,Im confused by that statement
1615483801,I have a trademark buying into green candles
1615483804,Joke. That was Kanye's estimation on trading
1615483821,ah gotcha! Jokes sometimes dont translate on text XD especially sarcasm
1615483831,I always have to put /s at the end for my jokes to land
1615483832,Forgot to put the emoji. Lol
1615483835,😂
1615483836,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1615483840,Lo. nice
1615483849,Too bad I stole his knowledge of futures
1615483864,How?
1615483869,i get a shrug with that
1615483879,/s means sarcasm
1615483882,||Cool||
1615483886,It was something they started doing a lot on reddit
1615483894,Why i left reddit
1615483903,I love parts of reddit
1615483905,stupid meme culture destroying our youth
1615483919,it entirely is based off what subreddits you follow
1615483927,I dont mean young childrten. I mean MY FUCKING YOUTH! I lost it on reddit
1615483929,I love the financial subreddits
1615483937,there are tons of great tips
1615483949,Yeah. Im just 'shilling' now. Excited for ENJ
1615483962,ENJ is looking kinda spicy
1615483964,ngl
1615483985,what isnt spicy is my negative PNL. ETH pls
1615483999,still 2x off the initial climb but man is it fucking me over today
1615484000,ETH is what is fucking with ENJ i think btw
1615484024,ETH is fucking itself over too so you know how it be
1615484036,Its literally suffering from its own success
1615484040,"Thats ENJ saying if i go down, i take you down with me"
1615484046,We're just bystanders
1615484055,Fucking politics
1615484060,Coin poilitics
1615484069,🤣
1615484073,can i name this chat to jerermy-and-whiteknight-only
1615484080,Yes please
1615484099,Hey iv been providing helpful futures info to many people in this chat today 😂
1615484103,If anyone is still in ENJ. I'd say dont sell. Wait
1615484112,@Cryptoknight but what if I wanna buy
1615484138,love u
1615484141,You'll get a better window IMO. We're full steam ahead right now.
1615484145,❤️
1615484152,See the history to udnerstand how much it could fall moire than this
1615484183,"BTW guys, when i talk, its Dazz talking. THis is all his wisdom. Would check out his stream today"
1615484187,Yeah I’m just edging on FOMO that’s all 😂
1615484190,"i still havent been able to properly figure out margin trading, futures seems way easier to understand, i dont get why it doesnt work the same way in the trade tab"
1615484192,"Alright fuck it, you win. Ill buy some ENJ at 10x futures"
1615484200,Bad idea man
1615484217,Not yet anyway. I've been watching this for 6 days now. BTC has a sun and moon effect on it
1615484224,"oh also, whats the liquidation fee"
1615484231,I'll probably do my future on something else
1615484257,I think what you are asking about is the fee that is placed when you sell
1615484261,You pay no fees when buying
1615484264,I almost bought 2k worth of enj today when i sold off my bnb during the dump
1615484266,you pay fees when selling though
1615484272,If btc dumps again we can see ENJ low 1.60 again
1615484280,are there any fees that you get when you actually get liquidated ?
1615484287,No
1615484287,Nope. ENJ will skyrocket if BTC dumps
1615484291,oh ok
1615484300,Everything dumps when btc dumps
1615484312,ENJ included :p
1615484313,"ENJ doesnt care about how much BTC price is. The more the volume change, the more ENJ is affected from what i've seen"
1615484318,This morning was an example
1615484327,Didnt happen the last time
1615484337,"It dumped a bit, but because people panic sold"
1615484337,It dropped to 1.61 this morning when btc dumped
1615484345,From 1.7
1615484359,It was 1.81 also this night
1615484365,So that 0.2 down
1615484377,But i rebought my bnb so still no enj position :kekw:
1615484378,Not that far from what we have now
1615484380,"So whever it peaks, it will come down atleast 0.15 pts"
1615484392,Even at $3 this will happen proportionately
1615484457,@kittiewitty look at depth right now. Its should be going up fast. But is not because BTC is going up
1615484484,And that doesnt mean that it goes up when btc goes down. Theres some other shit happening there
1615484524,Chr lost 150% :kekw:
1615484630,150%?
1615484810,@Cryptoknight Yeeeeeeeeeah... about that. you may want to scroll up in this chat...
1615484844,"ENJ was having a bullrun and was interrupted by btc 3 times, it always went down with it... thankfully it recovered and finally had a decent run now that btc has calmed down a bit"
1615484850,I was losing hairs earlier today
1615484992,I made 10£ this morning on it. Sold and moved to matic. 20£ on matic 🙂
1615485020,"https://www.twitch.tv/bcdcdaz
Watch Dazz about whats happening"
1615485199,Is this true?
1615485277,No first word was DAZZ 🙂
1615485315,you mean $DAZZ?
1615485403,"I will say I just tuned into just a few minutes of his last stream and he properly called out the spike they had. One thing I will say is he is overly bullish on his predictions though. He said it was going to go ""to the moon"". The spike isn't even close to it going to the moon but still cool he was able to predict the spike"
1615485500,One of the things I personally think is that he is good at analyzing BUT gets too emotionally attached to his coin picks hence why he is overly bullish when making his estimates.
1615485685,"""I think it will go up because of x"" ""its likely to gain value because of x"" ""Id keep an eye on this coin because of x"" are things someone who isnt emotionally attached would say. Saying things like ""Its going to the moon because of x"" ""its going to skyrocket because of x"" ""Its going to 300x its value because of x"" are things that people who ARE emotionally attached to their coins would say. We can predict bullish coins base on factors but no one knows HOW bullish a coin is going to be. predicting bullish/bearish is something that is achievable but quantifying that factor is very unreliable and most often wrong"
1615485687,how was he able to predict the spike?
1615485695,based on his beliefs or actual TA?
1615485729,"There was a market that was adding ENJ as a pair and he predicted because of the added ability to purchase it from other pairs, it would gain value"
1615485765,he said it would go to the moon though which not only was inaccurate but it also was a bad prediction. Having more pairs to trade with DOES add value but its not to the moon value
1615485767,"gotcha, that's pretty good"
1615485778,this I agree with 100%
1615485823,"Like I said, I respect his analysis skills but I think he needs to take a step back emotionally to be able to give more accurate predictions"
1615485830,Instead of selling my dumping chr I bought 6k dollar instead lol
1615485850,And then I made 100 dollar on selling them again :’)
1615485885,"He does substanciate though,but yeah,maybe we are emotionally invested.might be a reason for that. Time will tell"
1615485906,"in a market this violatile, we have to stay clear headed and think with our brains, not our hearts. nobody knows what's happening in the next 5 minutes, or 5 hours, much less 5 weeks"
1615485943,lmaooo
1615485974,what was your entry price for chr kittie?
1615485983,Original 1.6
1615485995,Euhm 0.6
1615486014,"I shouldn’t gamble on green candles, bad habit"
1615486018,looks like it is slowly recovering!
1615486048,I made it breakeven with my derping
1615486053,fomo is difficult to deal with
1615486056,"Deattaching emotion from trading is how you get to the next level of accuracy when trading. Fear of loss, emotional attachment, Fear of missing out. All of these are factors that make you lose money by giving way to your emotions. I respect his analysis skills but his predictions are overly bullish because of his emotional attachment to the coin. Im not saying he is bad at analyzing. He is probably far better than I am and I respect his skill in that aspect but its also inaccurate due to his emotional stake in it"
1615486061,I understand exactly where you're coming from
1615486086,Cant believe I still have profit with the shit I do tbh
1615486134,"Its really hard to remove from the equation though. Its not easy to stop being emotional when it comes to trading and the more capitol you put in, the harder it is to be completely emotionless but thats how you enhance your trading skills and prediction accuracy"
1615486166,Who are we talking about?
1615486176,Dazz
1615486281,"Thabks, will convey the message to him."
1615486286,He left because we laughed at him :kekw:
1615486293,Thin skin
1615486325,Don't get me started. Thin skin is far better than indecent people.
1615486336,I am emotionally attached to XSH
1615486337,Orbehaviour
1615486358,I do want to reiterate I do respect his analysis skills. If he can get emotions out of the equation I think he's going to be insane
1615486392,Its not easy to analyze the market past trend watching
1615486408,Im gonna make a PND group specifically to pump xsh so i can sell my 2.5 million :kekw:
1615486431,"I'll be a ""mod"" 😉"
1615486442,I’ll be a “helper”
1615486464,K
1615486467,"He's new too, and while I though initially it's beginners luck,I saw how much he puts into each analysis he does. You might be correct about his bullish predictions, but from what I can tell, he's a lot more emotionally invested in CRO. Enj might just be that off think. He also helped me with xvs,his tip, his direction. Had no issues with asking me to get out."
1615486496,Strangely xsh still has relative active trading. Even though its dead
1615486511,Makes me wonder if the japanese community is gonna take it back
1615486521,Im emotionally invested in ETH but it might be time to take the old pup out in the forest and send him to the farm
1615486528,💀
1615486533,:kekw:
1615486546,Long ada with us
1615486559,"Ok.no one panic, buti think enj about to skyrocket the moment it touches down at the 1.8 mark now."
1615486588,wat
1615486590,it's 1.8 now
1615486600,
1615486610,:kekw: i should of bought that 2k of enj :kekw:
1615486616,LMAO
1615486629,matic seems to be recovering very well
1615486635,might be chasing a new ath
1615486638,it's looking nice
1615486639,Mmmmmmm FOMO here
1615486644,at least at the moment
1615486660,"I'm now down over 25% in my ADA/BTC purchase. Thinking of cutting my losses and Short it to make something back. 1D graph just shows downward trend now BTC 1D is steady upwards for days
ADA is clearly linked to USD value rather than BTC"
1615486660,Its my favorite meal since door dash takes 5 hours

1615486746,I go all in on 1 coin because yolo
1615486748,Question is. What value will enj have end this year
1615486751,👀
1615486765,"0,3"
1615486770,:kekw:
1615486775,When we are 3 month into bearseason
1615486781,"No the real question is, what value will doge have after the americans get their stimmy checks 😉"
1615486796,ADA will rip soone
1615486803,"But see, that's different. I'm invested in eth to the extent that I KNOW it will be 5k but the end of the year.might be right, might be wrong. With ENJ,I don't care about the price. I care about hamy coins I have because this will be the currency of the future. The coin could be $1 or $10, it won't matter. It's not so much an attachment to the coin, as much it is with what it will bring to our lives. Btc and eth will naver become mainstream enough because they are focusing on the wrong market. This will. Btc mainstream is like asking a bunch of uneducated unexposed people (like villagers) to use plastic cards for the first time at atms..enj has already solved this problem by focusing on the right audience."
1615486821,"As you recall, us americans are idiots and I guarentee 15% of the stim check money is going into doge"
1615486838,"He doesn't care about the money, he cares about the project"
1615486841,Fair
1615486872,Im@out alrady. Too much dropped up and down lol still made my 20£ 🙂
1615486898,nice one!
1615486899,Almost 1.8 guys

1615486909,"I take your point though @Jeremyfto 
You're not wrong"
1615486909,lol
1615486928,Nm it bounced back
1615486929,ETH MIGHT be mainstream enough after 2.0; There is a lot of uncertainty on if 2.0 will come out in time to get that spike
1615486935,"Man. CHR built different, that's no cap"
1615486961,CHR on futures NOW
1615486967,Nooo CHR whyyyyy lol
1615486968,where u at binance
1615486986,I had a very strange feeling that 2.0 is still in its concept phase and what we saw was a prototype
1615486995,60 denied :kekw:

1615487026,momentum is looking good
1615487031,it just needs more volume to break
1615487032,No fees. Instant.
1615487036,I sold already :p
1615487041,ah
1615487042,God dammit.i think enj is going down again in a bit.no $2 today in that case.

1615487046,Apparently nano ATMs coming
1615487046,I hope so! I think nano's speed is a winner for my book. I hope it works out
1615487055,🥲
1615487062,Its probably my favorite as far as design is concerned
1615487066,that's kittie right now
1615487068,Enj can crash for abit.
1615487071,Instead of putting a limit sell order it put in a limit buy order
1615487078,With 100% of my usdt
1615487095,I need Jeremy's future tips to pay off so I can buy more before it goes higher haha
1615487109,ooo btc going for it again
1615487130,Careful. I lost a bit today trying that.been experimenting with various ways of losing money today
1615487167,"""been experimenting with various ways of losing money today""
hahahahha love that"
1615487168,Break even again Now
1615487179,Trading with 10k instead of 2k is more stressful
1615487191,"To give u a sense of things,I was trying to increase enj coin count by shorting it. My 4200 enj is now 3500"
1615487193,Why do I move it around that much also is the question
1615487210,jesus f
1615487211,10k
1615487213,you crazy
1615487230,what leverage do you use the most?
1615487237,None lol
1615487238,Actually very wise if u can part with it for a few months.
1615487243,ah spot trading?
1615487256,Not that much off a gambler lol
1615487259,aw
1615487263,why not lose money?
1615487267,I started with 3k btw
1615487268,:kekw:
1615487274,Sticking with my tactic
1615487279,Oh no 4K sorry :p
1615487288,"hell yeah, do what is going best for you"
1615487305,But if I just stayed put in FET
1615487308,Oh well
1615487324,FET on a dip
1615487334,Its a real hold coin
1615487339,I entered FET at 0.1 the first time
1615487342,Sigh :p
1615487354,Who knew :’)
1615487361,Enter before $1
1615487386,"My friend did apparently, he went all in on FET with 20k when it was 0.1"
1615487427,Reminder to self: listen to him
1615487432,I tried the other day lol sucked at it big time -2£ for 2 min lol
1615487473,"Another reminder, add him to group"
1615487501,Yeah man.i keep not listening to dazz and fucking it up
1615487538,He is looking for a *100 coin now
1615487544,"ada has formed a bit of a symmetrical triangle, no? might have a breakout very soon, so I'd keep an eye on it..."
1615487565,also it's been very tame and silent for several days now
1615487569,the beast might wake up soon
1615487592,11 days so far
1615487602,9 of those 11 were negative
1615487614,and that bigger drop was btc
1615487628,"yeah if we exclude that, very sideways movement"
1615487637,def opportunity for something soon
1615487643,"doubt it'll go down, it's ada"
1615487675,@Jeremyfto how long do u usually stay in a future? 10 mins? 1.hour?
1615487702,2 minutes for me
1615487715,leverage?
1615487727,I think leverage matters a lot in time you keep your position open
1615487732,40
1615487740,makes sense yeah
1615487750,I'd do minutes max for anything above 20x
1615487751,@Jeremyfto has been in ETH for days lmao
1615487762,2-10x is pretty chill.
1615487779,btc testing 57.5k again
1615487796,finally broke 57.3k after 4 rejections today
1615487902,I'mma listen to this guy
1615487910,I dont have patience for days
1615487919,ENJ might fly now
1615487966,Futures can be as long as you deem necessary
1615487978,damn btc is doing fairly good rn
1615487983,ath is so close
1615488015,@Cryptoknight do you think it might be worth getting in around now?
1615488127,I have 0 patience so high leverage is good for me
1615488146,Buy a nice dip cash out done for the day
1615488193,"what's your success rate, by your estimations?"
1615488224,When I don’t be retarded and fomo its pretty solid
1615488248,hahahah
1615488248,i have patience but watching coins stopping moving kicks my nerves
1615488257,Really dont know which way it will go from here. BTC is at 57k already. Dip in BTC incoming.
1615488261,have been on eth since 1530 but fuck it today
1615488264,That’s the only time I’ve really lost a lot was buying high and it crashes
1615488275,"I love wootloops' strategy, seems pretty safe tbh"
1615488286,Or not. No idea. Some say BTC will be 75k in a few weeks
1615488290,might even long btc 50x
1615488293,If we get to 1850 I might pull the plug
1615488299,Haha. Was just about to do this
1615488308,I’m aiming for 20% on my trade a day and in months I’ll have a ton
1615488312,But why not wait for a zigzag?
1615488329,"yeah I think we've all gone through at least one of these scenarios. hey, it's a learning curve for everyone"
1615488336,Ya defineitly
1615488361,"do you mind me asking how much you do per trade, considering the 40x leverage?"
1615488363,Imagine if jeremy closes his long
1615488368,Eth to 2.5k in two days
1615488395,"btc 80-85k usd by May, eth 4.5k by May"
1615488418,^ here is ur perfect long term exit strat
1615488422,"@Jeremyfto Bit confused about this. If i short it now, how do i 'sell' that order?"
1615488448,I usually set the slider to 50% right now I’m only using a couple hundred since I lost like 300 from fomo
1615488452,"You ""close"" the position with either ""Market"" or ""Limit"" in the positions tab"
1615488490,Theres not close button anywhere tho
1615488496,Will it come only after i buy>?
1615488497,"playing with similar amounts here too. good stuff, cheers man"
1615488504,yes and it's not labeled close
1615488519,Confused
1615488521,Figure if I can’t make it work with 200$ I won’t be any better off putting 2k into it lol
1615488525,"man i cant remeber who said ""yo you all should get out of ETH at 1800"" BLESS THAT DUDE BC HE WAS RIGHT and right now look at ETH/BTC"
1615488532,that bitch only does falling all day
1615488538,word. couldn't have said it better
1615488548,like 7 yo me falling of the stairs
1615488606,Yeah ETH/BTC is what doesn’t fill me with confidence
1615488606,This is correct if i want to limit my liability only to what i put in?
1615488609,those buttons
1615488621,@SeineJanie
1615488625,ETH just feels slow and past it rn
1615488648,Ahhh. Got it. It will come under the order
1615488653,Isolated is good if you have multiple positions open. It shields you from getting liquidated on all of them like when you use cross.
1615488666,But you have to manage margin for each position as well. Cross is fine for only one pos
1615488675,Just want to make sure it cant touch me anywhere other than what i put into it
1615488723,More in the same row:
1615488740,i think we are falling until 1700~~
1615488742,might be wrong
1615488743,It only ever takes money out of your futures wallet for liq
1615488747,Your spot wallet is safu
1615488752,but thats just my TA mixed with my rage and FUD
1615488781,fucking hell SaneJan
1615488783,125x again
1615488791,I'm getting nervous for you and it's not even my position
1615488791,even tho i put 85% more of the initial amount i entered this future position i only made 14 $
1615488793,ahhhhh
1615488865,Everything else is boring to me lol
1615488870,what does FUD stand for?
1615488881,Thanks. This helps
1615488885,I ain't got time all day 😄 Quick in 'n' out (title of my sex tape)
1615488889,I’ve closed my position. I’m done with ETH

1615489291,Damn g uys. Futures is so much more fun than regular old spot
1615489295,to happen i mean
1615489303,Welcomeeeeee
1615489315,"it really is. after futures, I'd never do spot trading"
1615489324,futures is great until youre on the wrong side of the trade and get liquidated for all your bankroll
1615489336,"if you wanna do spot trading, just do 2x leverage on futures... literally lowest risk, possible 2x gains"
1615489358,wait I heard my name? Whats going on?

1615489367,^^
1615489371,^^
1615489385,tru tho. Sometimes it be like that
1615489393,although I never short
1615489394,I love futures but be careful
1615489406,I have never ever ever gotten out with profits shorting cause Im shit at it
1615489414,He wont stop until he pulls up to school in a Lambo
1615489420,So who needs a Tesla anyways?
1615489422,i did only when I yelled at the coin to go down
1615489424,it works guys
1615489425,try it
1615489428,me!
1615489429,ye now he pulls up to a hot wheels lambo
1615489433,not financial advisor tho
1615489440,I’d like one
1615489444,Even a model 3
1615489449,It’s growing on me
1615489454,we can get matching model 3s ❤️
1615489468,Lmao
1615489472,I didn’t really like it at first
1615489490,But now i’m into it
1615489496,Im going for a white model 3 with the white interior and the white tires
1615489507,With 20’ plates
1615489522,Not white tires but the metal thing on the tires
1615489522,It’s 57k in my countri
1615489526,I forget what its called
1615489550,Mines going to cost 47ish with all my customizations
1615489559,Does it do everything the model x does?
1615489567,Im saving 30k and loaning the rest
1615489577,Cause I really like the model x
1615489590,Im pretty sure autopilot comes default on model x and model 3 its an add on but I could be wrong
1615489601,I just want a model 3 so I havent really looked into the others
1615489607,"58,7k dollar for the standard model here 😦"
1615489609,It’s a default thing
1615489616,For the model 3
1615489622,No its not. its a 10k add on
1615489641,Every single one i saw up for sale had it
1615489648,Even the 43k one
1615489653,That’s the cheapest here
1615489662,43k euros
1615489670,"when you buy new, you are building it. Its an option not default"
1615489687,entered ENJ again
1615489695,why do I keep entering ENJ
1615489699,What price?
1615489707,it really harrassed me today
1615489715,1.81
1615489727,Ouuch
1615489738,Not a good entry
1615489749,"bounded off 1.80 twice now, let's see"
1615489751,I was on the buy button when it was 1.8
1615489762,But it always regret
1615489769,"I know it's not a good entry, but it ain't going down past 1.8, is it? lul"
1615489771,CHR entry point now. A small dip
1615489773,So it will go up now for sure since I didn’t do it
1615489800,"not on futures, idc"
1615489804,:kekw:
1615489810,:kekw:
1615489821,@NotMatt
1615489834,10k damn
1615489842,That more expensive then mercedes
1615489850,Im still squirmish about futures. Dont want to take that risk
1615489855,ya but its almost not worth getting a tesla without autopilot
1615489862,its kinda the whole reason to get one
1615489876,they are nice for sure but you kinda look lame not having it
1615489881,"try 2x leverage, basically no risk there"
1615489891,lol we don't have autopilot
1615489898,well you ALWAYS have autopilot
1615489899,"just to learn and understand the UI, options, and what not"
1615489901,they are talking about making it a subscription add on and not a full add on
1615489902,Whats the point of buying a car with autopilot? Public transport is pretty much the sane thing tha
1615489920,just not the auto lane change and fully autonomous driving and traffic light stopping
1615489927,Public transport cant take you from florida to cali
1615489933,I don’t even know what that is
1615489935,https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-meme-gif-7715402
1615489937,but you can just turn it on and it will brake and accelerate and do simple turns
1615489944,Damn that’s not cheap
1615489953,But buying a tesla without that
1615489963,kinda stupid that traffic lights isn't included in base autopilot
1615489963,It’s like having a girlfriend
1615489971,And not being able to fuck her
1615489975,I thought owning a car was all about the driving experience
1615489978,"""SAFEST THING IN THE WORLD oh right we don't do traffic lights unless you pay up the price of a car"""
1615489983,Keep on the look out. They MIGHT make the subscription autopilot compatible with previous models
1615489991,so you might be able to get autopilot on your tesla
1615489991,Did that not use to be like 2500 dollars or somethng @Jeremyfto
1615489993,when they switch
1615489996,i have autopilot
1615490000,just not the full version
1615490016,you might be able to get the full version during subscription model
1615490023,i don't think fully autonomous is even legal here technically
1615490030,10k that is expensive for software for hardware you already have lol
1615490033,Iv only seen it at 10k BUT I have only been looking for 1-2 years
1615490047,Thats why they are trying to make it a subscription model especially when you lease
1615490055,no one leasing is going to want to add 10k to the price
1615490090,Just get a muscle car
1615490104,Nah I love teslas. Im not into muscle cars
1615490116,Im saving for offroad van
1615490122,"tesla is a muscle car, have you seen the power in that motor"
1615490137,And no charisma
1615490140,it isn't considered a muscle car. It doesnt have a loud engine
1615490147,true
1615490155,Its more like a less sporty sports car
1615490219,muscle cars make alot of noise but fucking japanese cars and robot cars beat them :kekwcoin:
1615490224,honestly their new 6 figure tesla I would consider a sports car
1615490229,the roadster?
1615490231,yep
1615490241,my dad bought a corvette
1615490253,only 200 in all of europe. its showing up end this year
1615490423,rich
1615490439,All this NFT craze. Should render some of my 3d models and try selling them but you have to pay etherium gas fees and there is no guarantee anyone will buy the thing unless its some pixelated stuff some influencer with large fallowing posted
1615490482,"NFTs will go one of two ways, they will become more prevelant in the normie market and gain value or they will die out and become a niche thing"
1615490491,it would be cool if NFTs were here to stay
1615490496,just gotta wait and see
1615490552,"The current NFT market is super bubble, it will burst and fall down hard bit i think the principle will stay, just the pricing will be more realistic"
1615490585,You dont think that a picture of a doge is worth 1 billion USDT?!? You're out of your mind
1615490589,/s
1615490752,has cz already make the announcement
1615490763,talking about NFT's 😛
1615490778,yes
1615490791,cant post links here but yes
1615490809,binance hired ex US senator Baucus as their foreign advisor
1615490834,I can't either lol
1615490845,you can check BNB's graph to see how much shit everyone gave about the announcement
1615490867,Still up tho
1615490874,true
1615490881,WTF WAS THAT PUMP
1615490886,the announcement hype
1615490900,like I said
1615490906,nobody gave a damn about a US senator
1615490913,so it dumped back to where it was prior
1615490917,lmao depends if he is friends with trump
1615490980,it didnt dump down to prior
1615490993,Yeah may short it
1615491003,too late to short it now imo
1615491009,agreed
1615491225,Uhm MEANWHILE BTC is gonna hit its all time high
1615491233,Thanks bud. Futures is gold. Have already lost $10. Time to make some now
1615491251,I still think its going to crash
1615491254,on USDT its only 200ish under
1615491268,"If it hits 60k, no doubt it crashes"
1615491280,At this pace it will hit it by sunday
1615491329,I bought a bit of ENJ
1615491339,We're even
1615491341,I own 2139 ENJ
1615491359,You'll have 42K by dec
1615491369,I own it in futures though
1615491370,maybe you can do a co-op with @NFT Nazzy ?
1615491377,so paid 10x less
1615491378,Huh? How?
1615491392,"Oh, you're going really long then?"
1615491395,I went to futures and bought 10x
1615491402,yep
1615491407,have made 20$ so far
1615491409,At what price did you buy?
1615491412,not complaining
1615491417,"Dude, careful"
1615491417,yeah TBH longing ENJ is probably a good choice
1615491424,What price did you buy at?
1615491431,1.847
1615491437,Djeezes
1615491442,Can you still exit?
1615491444,What’s your liq price?
1615491451,1.67
1615491454,There will def be a better entry
1615491456,I can exit whenever I want
1615491464,One sec
1615491469,Ada is currently dead
1615491470,Ill make 20$ and then prob get out
1615491476,20$ more
1615491485,And i have to hold it
1615491488,Fuck
1615491499,When shit goes up it doesn’t
1615491506,But when shit goes doen
1615491510,Down
1615491520,It loves going down
1615491540,do you guys think XEM will dive after the split?
1615491546,Im really not comfortable right now with BTC at ATH
1615491561,Im pretty comfy for a short day trade
1615491568,im not holding it for more than today
1615491570,Im actually considering a long
1615491578,i am at +31$ rn
1615491582,off 400
1615491585,:virgin: i should of bought that enj damnit
1615491586,oh well
1615491588,whatever
1615491592,Best way to make some money is to wait for the 'crazy spike'
1615491606,it hasn't monned yet
1615491622,It will mon tonight
1615491644,SO CLOSE
1615491645,But whether it crosses 2$ is another question. It will try very very hard after todays announcement
1615491651,"I'll sell at around 1.90, then re-enter the dip and dump it on the asians later"
1615491652,Alright Im +10% now
1615491702,Goddamn I had to go and run an errand and I miss ENJ
1615491728,:virgin: I don't have my credit card reader I can't even join in
1615491731,i guess I could sell a BNB
1615491731,Whos nazzy?
1615491908,well its pretty obvious futures is how you make money. not doing actual trading. :kekw:
1615492086,"actual trading is just slow. Why buy 10 coins when you can buy 100 coins. Even 2x is great for long positions. Your liq is at a 50% drop range which is generally pretty safe and if you are right on your trade analysis, you make double the profits"
1615492096,@hollowviper Your window is back. Wait a bit and see what it does
1615492111,@Alanox whatsapp
1615492145,me
1615492239,mhm. I would probably long nano.
1615492384,bnb needs to go past 290

1615492493,1.70304
1615492500,What an awkward deliveroo order i just had delivered
1615492500,That ain’t too bad
1615492514,How bout this. Buy both ENJ long and short for exactly the same amounts
1615492530,🤯
1615492532,Condoms and orange juice
1615492535,Yummy
1615492546,Gotta have an afterwork out drink
1615492561,Thats smart. Incase you want to carry the juice but not hold the carton
1615492566,Yep
1615492570,Raspberry shot to warm up?
1615492572,I feel like a fat ass after having sex. Im always huffing and puffing even though Im like mega skinny
1615492574,Little shots of orange juice

1615492682,Oh. Lol. I've already lost $10 to liquidation. Bit freaky.
1615492696,It could go down now though btw. This is the first time its hovered around its ATH
1615492776,@Jeremyfto 😳
1615492782,so if I get it right. liquidation is just. you go 0. you lose all the money which unlike normal trading you cant get back
1615492788,negative isn't possible right?
1615492801,Just happened to me. Lost only what i put in
1615492810,VIA PUMP!
1615492823,yea @That one belgian super cunt
1615492824,they need to pump fucking GTO
1615492834,FUCK! Why cant these assholes pump something thats on futures
1615492850,they purposefully dont
1615492855,btc at it again
1615492860,:kekw:
1615492866,BTC is gonna get jeremy liquidated
1615492888,O fuck there the bears go
1615492900,6.7% ... meh
1615492905,Good thing I pulled out before it could bite
1615492907,Kappa
1615492913,Can't wait to see it overgo it's ath by 20$ every day
1615492978,Stop selling bnb before 290 tf
1615492994,No please continue so I can buy more
1615493052,You can go to jail for market manipulation.
1615493067,Good thing crypto is not a regulated market then
1615493067,Which coin is best to buy
1615493081,Also ENJ is bringing in the dough
1615493084,Guy just stopped me from selling my 60k BNB
1615493093,I'd reeeaaaallllly let go of this 'advantage'. Things are going to change rapidly soon.
1615493093,Manipulative af
1615493116,:virgin:
1615493120,feel bad man
1615493124,"Seriousy doubt it. The way politicians are, most dont even know what a crypto is"
1615493127,Wow. You do what you're told!
1615493142,Politicians dont rule the world
1615493154,They make the laws though
1615493154,They arent the ones to worry about
1615493160,No
1615493167,We THINK they make the law
1615493179,Richie rich makes the law
1615493185,Yes. They may be controlled by an external force but you cant create a law when you dont even know how things work
1615493192,even a lot of the rich people dont know what crypto is
1615493195,they just buy it
1615493195,lol
1615493215,do you remember Gene Simmons shilling ADA?
1615493216,"True, I remember when DN got arrested here by the SEC"
1615493231,Nope lol but I also dont follow any famout people
1615493236,"Yeah, as long as its rationalized. Its easy to rationalize why crypto should be regulated. I myself find it hard to find more pros than cons."
1615493239,We all know it's Bogdanoff
1615493246,Also I got out of ENJ
1615493257,DN?
1615493259,Im up 77$ from my trades with ENJ though
1615493265,almost 25%
1615493267,Deez Nuts lmfao
1615493270,and thats after fees
1615493272,😂
1615493274,Got em
1615493298,Pump is overrated
1615493306,Sensei. Teach me. Patience more than anything else
1615493321,@Jeremyfto You betting up or down>?
1615493325,bro you are the super bull on ENJ
1615493330,I was betting up
1615493334,going X10 long for you should be a no brainer
1615493335,was?
1615493341,yeah he got out
1615493344,Ya I closed my trade at +50$
1615493354,Too new to how this works. And i do expect ENJ to fall atleast 3 times before $3
1615493366,but how low do you think it will go
1615493384,IMO the floor is now 1.75-1.8
1615493387,"so this just happened again. I think I don't understand limit buys

I just wanted to set a limit short at 55000USDT to start shorting BTC
I setup my size and put in a TP/SL
Then I pressed sell/short
And it went through instantly at the price of 57155"
1615493392,"Unless BTC collapses, it will hold"
1615493400,"Sometimes you have to be patient, sometimes you have to not have patience"
1615493412,And sometimes you're left a patient
1615493424,man I should of gotten my fiat changed today
1615493425,
1615493435,1000 euro X 10 long enj :kekw:
1615493445,This Gene dude just woke yo?
1615493477,"Sure, heres my futures progression.

$3 > $4 > $10 > $1000"
1615493496,1000 euro for one enj:kekw:
1615493510,No. My first few trades on futures
1615493517,Last one because of you
1615493522,nice
1615493539,if you made mad money because of me i want a cut bro :kekw:  il shill enj with you
1615493557,Damn it. Im actually considering doing 1k now.
1615493573,"Actually, lemme do $100 first, then 1K"
1615493615,if you truly believe in the coin you can do 1K :godsgardener: not financial advice
1615493633,"That is because limiting a short is similar to selling. Selling will always sell at the limit price or HIGHER. If you want to enter at exactly a certain price, do a stop market"
1615493656,Well I just made $50 on ENJ
1615493660,Might dip in again
1615493671,Stop markets will market enter you at a price no matter what
1615493691,"so if you set a stop market to 55k short, it will enter you at 55k no matter what"
1615493716,but it won't enter until it hits it right
1615493723,that is correct
1615493731,Yeah then that is what I am looking for
1615493757,Limit buys always buy at x price or lower. Limit sells/shorts always sell/short at x price or higher. Stop markets will enter you at exactly that price via a market order. Stop limit will create a limit order at exactly that price
1615493845,^^ 🙂
1615493873,Now I need to get rid of my accidently shorted witout losing money lol
1615493880,wtf is this shit
1615493887,@Jeremyfto My prediction for BTC is that it will start its fall on the 12th. Back to 48K. Makes sense?
1615493901,I was thinking the exact same lol
1615493907,I personally dont know what the fuck BTC is going to do. A LOT of big money is involved on both sides
1615493923,it just depends on which side has the bigger whales
1615493928,Dont particitpate in the first pump.
1615493956,i’m not doing anything idek what it is
1615493974,i don’t do pumps
1615493975,
1615493992,Its danger.
1615494010,Honestly BTC could just keep going up or it can crash the fuck down. Normal chart patterns aren't something I am going to rely on for the BTC war
1615494023,Too much big money manipulation
1615494038,"Yes, but 58500 is all time high so psycological effect may cause a lot of sells imo"
1615494039,Thats my personal opinion on the matter though
1615494053,"The problem is that its halfway through its second M on the daily. If projections of 75K by the end of the half year are to be believed, this is the only route it can take. @Jeremyfto"
1615494056,cant do nano futures. damnit
1615494092,Futures is the trend now or what
1615494099,If you ain't on futures you ain't hip I guess
1615494111,or you can do futures on nano and I am just retarded
1615494115,probably the second one
1615494120,ENJ testing 1./9
1615494144,Fuck. Its going to go through to 2 most likely
1615494171,:virgin:
1615494177,there's not much volume atm
1615494179,maybe not yet
1615494219,In another 5 hours
1615494224,but these continued attempts make enj very bullish to me
1615494228,When will be a good price to fill up by ENJ bags some more do you think?
1615494241,*My
1615494248,it held support pretty good at 1.80
1615494250,50xing DOGE. Please forgive me crypto lords
1615494251,aim for that price for now
1615494263,"if btc falls, it may go lower than 1.80"
1615494267,With your entire college fund??
1615494272,🥺
1615494279,😂 Nah just 400$
1615494286,"right now we dunno what btc will do nor where it will go. it's gonna on standby, while also very near an ath"
1615494291,so wait for now
1615494291,Just gotta wait till Elon tweets
1615494293,Boring 🤪
1615494294,Well 475. I made 75 off ENJ 50x lol
1615494318,I've found out that there is some crazy connection between Elon and Doge-prizes!
1615494332,volume increasing on enj
1615494343,And **BOOM** Lambo
1615494348,"speaking of boring, DOGE is fucking boring. Its tick speed is sooooo slow"
1615494362,I'm out
1615494374,ENJ finally hit my sell-order
1615494388,nice
1615494398,ENJoy your profit
1615494405,lol
1615494411,I am done for today. I am turning depressed. :kekw:
1615494430,im a fucking dumbass I swear to god just shoot me
1615494440,"you mean you'll miss out on some amazing money making opportunities, therefore allowing others to take advantage of them while you won't?"
1615494442,wow.
1615494445,:kekw:
1615494460,Alright I lost 6$ thanks to fees on Doge. I stick back to my shit coin status opinion. Doge not worth
1615494464,I can't fucking take advantage because I don't have BUSD :kekw:
1615494469,oh shit lmfao
1615494481,it really is poopy
1615494506,enj is really struggling to get that 1.90
1615494515,volume is decentish
1615494522,but no where near enough to break through resistance
1615494530,unless a whale jumps in 🤤
1615494531,Just one big dip before the Japanese step in please
1615494541,"Speaking of fees, for eth futures other than the binance fees do you pay gas fees ?"
1615494549,Nope
1615494557,it just the binance fees
1615494559,?
1615494563,All you pay is funding fees and sell fees
1615494565,lol
1615494569,Phew
1615494573,VOLUME SPIKE!
1615494579,1.90 breached
1615494584,You’d think I’d know this by day 7 of trading eth on futures but
1615494590,a whale just came in
1615494592,knew itttttttt
1615494606,Dont sweat it.. Futures are confusing as fuck
1615494686,Lol. They removed their tweet about the pump. Is that normal?
1615494718,1.9 bounced
1615494776,In again at 1.81
1615494778,FOMO'd in with 1 BNB :kekw:
1615494792,Don't worry
1615494802,There are enough asians for all of us to share
1615494823,ENJ Bullish

1615494832,I didnt

1615494860,I did snatch 1.80 like an hour ago

1615497060,the best layer 2 solutions for eth rn are matic and optimism
1615497079,"optimism has no tokens so you can't buy, just runs straight off eth"
1615497083,aka matic to the moon
1615497149,so what is the deal with coins being listed on coinbase? The bot just gave an alert that skl and sushi were listed there right now
1615497197,this is skl. imho skl was listed on coinbase 2 days ago - first spike on the chart. Then trading started earlier today (2nd spike) and now it gets listed on coinbase again 3rd spike coming out of the 2nd one)?
1615497224,what????
1615497225,lol
1615497235,seriously guys
1615497243,there's something extremely fucking bullish about matic
1615497267,"it has insane surgers, then stabilizes, rides sideways, until it blows up again"
1615497271,super fking bullish lol
1615497274,it repeated that pattern at least a dozen times
1615497366,big oof

1615497716,sometimes I want to just take my profits and run for my ETH position but I kinda dont wanna quit on it. Im a little too attached to it after walking it down this far
1615497725,you will die on 2K
1615497733,Started it off at a wee 1500 entry price
1615497739,@Jeremyfto I’ve closed on ETH I’m sorry brother

1615499905,Matic got listed on coinbase
1615499923,"Remember the days I said Matic was a must, at 0.02, 2 months ago"
1615499929,coinbase's stock of matic was almost up so they went and bought some million
1615499979,"Some followed me, others said that I was only calling for a coin cause I had money there 🤦‍♂️ ahaha"
1615500000,oh they are trying to go back up
1615500050,am i the only one watching theta? nearly down to 7.2
1615500084,"I say Matic will go to 1$ at least, not right now, but it will"

1615500138,5 bil market cap at that price... i see it
1615500165,link next... most of you probs hold it but dont sleep on link

1615500250,like 100+ to a couple hundreds
1615500256,yup
1615500328,"basically the best oracle for all blockchain rn, chart setup looks primed to either explode on the upside or dump on the downside"
1615500335,but link is too hype and too important to dump
1615500356,basically any institutional transaction on blockchain will utilize link for security
1615500671,"Yup! And it could be the L2 solution for Uniswamp for example.
Has partnerships with graph, ethereum, sushiswap, quickswap, etc etc ... ATARI, fucking atari ahahah"

1615501991,Best privacy ever

1615502034,@Jelle any thoughts on fetchai
1615502042,"really cool project, i've invested a bit into it"
1615502056,Can you send the link to the site?
1615502067,https://fetch.ai/
1615502073,"read the use cases as well, very interesting"
1615502073,casper ICO hasn't even opened there is no sail yet
1615502184,found these two too
1615502293,I mean CHSB:))
1615502297,oooh
1615502301,casper Ive registered:) and waiting:)
1615502319,well TBH I wouldn't mind more money in CHSB since its super duper stable
1615502351,Fuck ye.. lol
1615502366,I regret now not buying more as i got it it was 1USD:)
1615502474,i have some USDt a side  for Casper sale:)  got bit of SYL and  when I have casper. Plus i have soem ADA and swiss. I'll just sit back and wait    coins to be listen on echanges and price go UP:) mean while   staking and Yeilding. evry little helps. 1 token here one there..:)
1615502492,i wonder if CHSB will ever be on binance
1615502525,that wild be FIRE... CBSH has BNB  🙂 so why binance not to return favore lol
1615502543,probably because of the massive amounts of manipulation with super whales
1615502562,Ah fack was in a meeting and I feel like I missed a good sell point in matic smh
1615502563,greedy cunts u mean?:)
1615502575,we are all greedy in some ways
1615502670,"we all want more. but there shoudl be room for others. that what  like in CHBS.. they seem like ""everyone welcome"" yeild form 1 token.  2k coins now premium basic. NO  lock it for 7-10-30 days. only 24 hours. plus burning tockens things. to me seem like fair chance given."
1615505410,why is LTC taking such a shit
1615505470,"is anyone able to explain this? :/ Matic followed suit a bit later, but there was no new alert about it being listed. What I don't understand is mainly how the same coin can be listed twice."
1615506109,nvm it's not
1615508160,ive said this before and ill say it again... if ur gunna buy ltc might as well just buy btc or eth
1615508163,btc or eth will do better
1615508172,Look at enj!
1615508179,"also matic was listed on coinbase bro, not coinbase yet"
1615508237,"so for all these coins the listing 2 days ago was coinbase pro, then they started trading there at 5pm today and **then** they got listed and opened for trading at regular coinbase?"
1615508266,oh coinbase PRO
1615508267,lol
1615508270,with matic still being due for that last step? 👀 👀 👀
1615508275,"yes, but not sure about the timeframe between a coinbase pro and coinbase listing"
1615508287,"thank you, it all makes sense now"
1615508441,lol i just realized i wrote bro instead of PRO
1615508443,hahaha
1615508512,failed again
1615508598,"Well, my sell order got reached"
1615508603,Not complaining
1615508779,so so so close to btc ath
1615508908,might hit soon
1615509833,"Do you think it will moon or crash ?
What do you think about Ada 1d trend ? 7Ma about to it 25Ma"
1615509873,Not anymore.
1615509935,wow chz still going up even if BTC was dropping
1615509935,It’s crashing right now
1615510105,did you manage to get some btc in your wallet?
1615510466,BTC at 46K again soon. Hide your children
1615510554,lol
1615510563,i wish
1615510641,"Nah not yet, unfortunately. Haven’t found a person yet."
1615510709,"Well I have, but they haven’t made a decision yet. I’m just waiting for it"
1615510725,why don't you just do it yourself?
1615510745,"Needs verification, I am 17"
1615510756,ask your parents
1615510764,"or wait, learn and practise for a year"
1615510775,There is this law that is called KYC. It basically means provide ID or your not getting it
1615510784,or be creative and find a way to remain anonymus. It's crypto after all
1615510805,"That’s what I’m doing right now, 4 months till my birthday and I’ll practice till i hit 18"
1615510829,Yeah once I am old enough I’ll transfer funds to an unverified Binance account and I’ll trade there too. Luckily you can transfer funds without an ID (I think) and trade but the daily limit is 2BTC. With the way BTC is doing my daily withdrawals could be up to 80K per day lmao
1615510961,MATIC hit .45 again
1615511011,matic trending on stocktwits!!! hahahahaha
1615511014,pump it!
1615511211,
1615511229,fibonacci level
1615511231,Idk if I should cashout until btc crash or I will miss a good increase 😂
1615511264,its gonna be hard to go hard again alooot of people are gonna be ready to dump their bags
1615511289,heh i lost 100€ in two days because of not cashing out
1615511296,and i could have recover from the dip
1615511308,now im even lower
1615511546,"Sell, it’s going down"
1615511574,Or HODL.
1615512068,"for anyone who cares about CAKE, it's maybe entering bearish zone again"
1615512102,broke $12 buywall ~15 min ago
1615512460,i like cake
1615512462,sold all of mine tho
1615512622,"When, u rckn?"
1615512726,Wher a u from?
1615512743,"UK, homie"
1615512755,Oh
1615512764,Betway👍
1615512775,Ez money
1615512788,I might just do that
1615512803,"Tbh this whole investing thing is a gamble, depending on how you look at it"
1615512810,Especially crypto
1615512830,How u gonna practice when u don’t have an exchange acc?
1615512845,This thing called paper trading
1615512858,Totally agree
1615512868,I’ve already started it and I’ve made +1.2% on my original investment
1615512875,Tell me more
1615512885,What’s the website called?
1615512893,It’s an app I’m using
1615512896,Better than nothing I guess
1615512903,But it’s main stocks only
1615512908,Not crypto
1615512921,The app gives you money and you buy stocks and sell them when you want
1615512939,"That’s basically it, and it uses the real time stock market as reference"
1615512943,How do u get this?
1615512965,U can do stocks under 18?
1615513026,"if u can, try thinkorswim for paper trading"
1615513075,I’m from Australia btw :))
1615513109,And I’m 17 also
1615513118,So is paper trading the same as stocks?
1615513136,Except u can do it if ur under 18?
1615513163,paper trading is fake money
1615513167,real trading is real money
1615513179,"but it works the same, just a way to practice"
1615513212,There's a site where you can trade stocks with btc
1615513225,It's somewhat limited but reasonable options
1615513665,You can chat me up for such trusted site
1615514343,Wdym by fake money?
1615514370,What’s the app called?
1615514423,best brokers
1615514467,Trust me when you download the app you’ll know
1615514495,like... fake money lol you dont put real money in. It's like a stock market video game
1615514512,try Thinkorswim its by TD
1615514596,This dude is either a narc or a person who just hasn’t done their research before talking
1615514642,Me?
1615514659,Nah someone else.
1615514731,@aChuuuuuuu let me know when you download it and actually have a go at it
1615514988,"Yeah, it’s not real money I see.....  So u practice using this app to get better at ur entry and exit points and then when u turn 18 u do it for real with MONEY??"
1615515312,"Yeah essentially. You might still not want to get into it the moment you turn 18, there’s nothing wrong with doing more research and not just wasting all your money on the stocks."
1615515421,RN bitcoin and BNB are save and easy money in my opinion
1615515473,But there is nothing wrong with educating yourself more on the topic before you actually start.
1615515509,I'd still recommend not going in with more than a few hundred dollars once you use real money
1615515643,Yep👍
1615515656,Just downloaded it
1615515712,Imma give it a shot Rn
1615515860,link converging hard on $30 on the 4hour chart
1615515864,could shoot to the upside
1615515866,~40

1615520899,theta maybe starting to recover
1615520920,good time to buy in!
1615521650,ENJ knocking on the doors of 2.00

1615530274,chz keeps pushing on
1615530343,Go go go
1615530604,Is it btc ath day?
1615530664,Possibly
1615530677,Very close to that day :-)
1615530723,Huge gains from ENJ the last 20-30
1615531281,Rip the thought of a lower re entry on ENJ
1615531337,Probably can make more money on CHZ at the moment. Lower starting price and has been bullish movement this week
1615532883,wut NFT's being explained on public radio today lmao
1615532896,*national radio
1615533647,they're trending heavy
1615533673,"Even the most casual crypto investors (just holding a bit of btc, clueless about altcoins) are bringing it up"
1615533689,nft hype/run maybe just starting 😉
1615534646,
1615534650,Good bye ada
1615534743,that's almost a BUY
1615534784,dont buy until it at least looks to turn bullish again lmao
1615534787,Dont think so ada go down all time bitcoin go down
1615534803,But when bitcoin recover ada dont recover
1615534826,So dont know if is a buy
1615535022,It’s people with paper hands
1615535028,They’ll regret it soon enough
1615535048,Is it a good idea to buy drep? The supply will be reduced to 100 million instead of 10 billions
1615535201,Sounds promising 🙂
1615535211,And price is dirt cheap
1615535223,Any thoughts ?:)
1615535520,BTC went above its All time high compared to EUR. USDT almost got there now dipping down 😢
1615535622,Not after the conversion 100 old to 1 new.
1615535877,🤔
1615535984,When do they plan to reduce  supply ?
1615536075,"No idea, just went on the website"
1615536125,In my logic it would make price higher. It’s 0.01 now I find it cheap 🙂
1615536154,:kekw: fucking enj
1615536156,Effectively 1.00 now
1615536177,Because that's the price for old token
1615536207,urgh I need to future enj damnit
1615536209,ada too probably
1615536287,I see. As I went on binance to check price.
1615536300,The belgians are missing the ENJ train man 😂
1615536342,Im for some days now. But it went up since yesterday 🙂
1615536522,eh il survive
1615536541,500 bucks into a 10X future on enj should work out nicelyK.
1615536673,Sounds like a plan.  I need to figure this x thing out 🙂
1615536970,😩
1615536988,nano down to 5.1. ada almost 1 bucks. 🥲
1615537061,ADA To THE MOON!
1615537076,i am still green on ada so I am not too worried
1615537092,I soo glad i exited
1615537098,same
1615537111,gonna be words you are gonna take back in the end
1615537127,"Oh, i'll go back in. When its 0.5"
1615537135,I already used that amount to invest in other stuff
1615537144,depends on the strat you are using I guess
1615537162,although I'm failing this week but ok :p
1615537237,"HEY! If you're in ENJ, you are NOT failing. Mind your fucking language!"
1615537256,until the NFT bubble goes boom
1615537258,I just reentered at 2 dollar now 😂
1615537279,not sure if the good move :p
1615537287,i can't do anything anyway ATM
1615537302,Nope. Most likely will fall some more
1615537320,yea thats what we were saying yesterday also
1615537331,And it did fall to a nice buy in
1615537340,1.82 or something
1615537343,1.8
1615537362,I even asked yall to set a buy limit at 1.82
1615537377,But no one listens to me 😩
1615537385,"Its ok. When im a millionaire, i wont care"
1615537402,I can hire people to listen to me
1615537410,:kekw: don't get ahead of yourself
1615537421,that is what killed people during the bear season
1615537427,Just keep breathing. Keep calm and carry on 💆🏻‍♂️
1615537448,eh ada can go down to 0.8 and then il buy some more
1615537451,"If dumbasses keep picnicing without a safety net, obviously the bears will get them"
1615537462,we have no control over bears
1615537469,the moment bears take over bitcoin its done
1615537476,ADA will bottom out at 0.6 i think. 0.8 and 0.6 are two visible floors
1615537478,if bear season is the same like last time
1615537484,we are all done for tbh :p
1615537486,yup
1615537493,enj would probably fall to like 10 cents
1615537493,Why? STOP LOSS bro
1615537494,Guys what's CHZ prediction by Monday?
1615537494,the only safety net is cashing out 😂
1615537504,but even a stop loss
1615537507,to do what?
1615537510,buy a dip
1615537511,Cash out
1615537512,that dips again
1615537513,I bought CHZ with all my money at 0.25
1615537527,assuming you know that it is bear season
1615537530,"I dont trust BTC right now, so again ENJ is perfect. BTC goes down eENj goes up"
1615537538,I'm wondering if I should sell now or wait for Monday.
1615537559,"I would sell, so you should keep it"
1615537559,Put a stop loss. Dont sell
1615537565,yea a stop loss
1615537570,also a good option :p
1615537585,Reason i say this is that BTC might very well go up even higher
1615537595,atleast the weekend is time for planning
1615537651,This weekend is going to be completely red most likely. See btc 6h
1615537669,Do we need to have a bear season what if everyone just keeps buying
1615537677,Stop loss? But it's had a healthy rise of 100%
1615537687,It creates a higher support every pump
1615537695,Will it fall all the way back?
1615537698,thats betting against history
1615537702,Whats the 'it'?
1615537709,CHZ
1615537714,lol
1615537750,It's a sports token everyone in Europe are crazy about this kind of stuff...
1615537751,I'd put a stop loss. It can go up too. Dont mess too much with these NFT coins. They are the futur
1615537761,I've enj coins i've bought at 1.55 tell me what to do
1615537762,Makes sense...
1615537821,go to Dazzy his twitch and have faith
1615537855,Leave them there
1615537856,Holly shit every time I come to this chat I only see ENJ 🤦‍♂️ some moderator please change name from crypto-only-chat to #enj-only-chat 😆 🤣
1615537880,means I've to hold them for now
1615537888,its the coin that keeps on giving
1615537904,"Idk, how much of a gambler are you?"
1615537912,the sure thing is to take profit at some point right
1615537930,Ideally. Or you could sell and put a buy order at 1.9. I ithink it may fall to there today
1615537936,No promises tho
1615537962,"Still bullish on the minute,. Lol"
1615537965,I think it'll fall to 1.6-7  lowest in 24hrs
1615537971,No chance
1615537974,I dont think so man
1615537986,1.8 if we're lucky

1615538157,Nah man. Highly unlikely right now.
1615538163,Needs a day to settle
1615538176,"If it does go to 2.15, we're in trouble"
1615538191,why?
1615538200,WOuld mean we're about to crash
1615538209,thats good right
1615538212,thats my exit point
1615538220,ideal scenario :p
1615538224,Think big. We need $10
1615538300,"If something like 2.15 happens too fast, it would mean we're about to cross to the other side of the BB soon. Which means we're back to 1.2-1.3"
1615538323,Lol swapped 1k enj coins for Ada last month.... Now I'm sad
1615538325,This also means another 2-3 months before we go beyond 2.1
1615538369,auw
1615538501,so @Cryptoknight where would you sell now?
1615538537,but like fuck me; there are no major sell walls until 2.2
1615538740,So then 2.2 is the limit we shouldnt cross. My bad.
1615538754,Currency issues. lol
1615538777,you are frow sweden right?

1615539223,DONT DO DRUGS KIDS! Stay away from @Patawic
1615539249,drugs arent that bad
1615539252,just dont get hooked
1615539268,Delusional
1615539285,"Hmmm. Just so we know, how much coke do you stake in your butthole?"
1615539295,i dont do or deal drugs
1615539295,p l s
1615539326,"ADA just waiting on some news at the moment. Once April is done, you’ll be wondering why you didn’t buy more of it"
1615539348,i've got ada buy orders set at 1.05
1615539407,"The fact that people think ADA is going below .8 again, let alone .6 after it literally held price when everything was getting ruined a couple weeks ago makes me wonder how they function"
1615539424,yeh pretty dumb
1615539436,"i bought in at 40cents, so im still ahead regardless of where it sits"
1615539473,The percentage of people staking says it all
1615539486,And it’s increasing more and more
1615539503,its like 60% staked or something crazy
1615539515,there was an infographic with all the wallet stats a few wks ago
1615539518,i wonder if its been updated
1615539566,"New wallets down a bit, but still over 4000. 

% of wallets staking getting higher and higher. People found their way to staking.

% of ADA staked getting dangerously close to 72% again.
Last time we had this a big price pump started.

Keep the 72% in mind...."
1615539585,Pieter nierop posts the stats
1615539591,On Twitter. I can’t link though

1615539712,Yes because the fomoers are getting out lmao
1615539727,And i wouldnt mind them going out anyways
1615539734,The problem with ADA right now is its reliance on BTC. BTC WILL fall. What will happen to ADA then?
1615539766,Ada is pretty strong on its own since couple of weeks
1615539767,"You actually have your head in the sand. When BTC got ruined the other week, ADA was the ONLY crypto going up!"
1615539780,because of the hype to the forking
1615539789,Fork hype.
1615539793,I was in it then
1615539796,What do you think will happen with Goguen coming up?
1615539797,CHR back in the game
1615539802,Lets go for new ath
1615539808,What do you think will happen with the next two developments?
1615539830,"When Africa announcement comes, I hope you have a spare amount to chuck in"
1615539844,But i mean bitcoin fall just 1k and ada go down 11 cents
1615539850,"Listen, i dont know why you all are so sensitive to touch. I'm with ADA. I believe in it. But theres a matter of getting in at the right time. And i dont believe its ok to do so when BTC is skyrocketing"
1615539857,Bitcoin up 3k ada up2 cents LOL
1615539873,Check the correlation chart. Its super confusin
1615539873,keep laughin boi
1615539893,whats up with this CHR coin
1615539895,"ol m8 @Cryptoknight bought ada before the fork, and panic sold when it dropped 6%"
1615539900,Who's laughing?
1615539906,i WANT ada to do well
1615539914,ADA and ENJ are my two money makers
1615539917,If Enjin his strat is to not hold coins
1615539920,you bought in 2 late b r e h
1615539925,then it was the right decision tbh :p
1615539926,YOU MADE MONEY OF ADA
1615539930,*off
1615539932,Yes
1615539934,why?
1615539939,BRO ITS DONE NOTHING BUT DROP FOR ME
1615539944,rip
1615539947,im up 400%
1615539974,Enjin made me like $20
1615539980,"You suck at crypto right now, always check with us before making an entry. Tag post grads"
1615540007,I put in like 2 weeks ago after the news said it was the next Bitcoin
1615540017,bitcoin has taken almost 12yrs to get to where it is
1615540023,dont expect a coin to pop off like it in 2wks
1615540028,Psh
1615540037,ada is a longterm hold
1615540038,It coukd
1615540039,we are in bull season
1615540040,could*
1615540052,everything is popping off each day :p
1615540066,
1615540075,Yes im making Money with ada but is so scary
1615540100,You’re showing a lack of knowledge about the product. Saying buzzwords/terms like ‘I believe in the project’ doesn’t mean you actually understand anything
1615540125,If you believe in ADA you are staking it
1615540145,but again if your goal is to high risk invest
1615540151,ADA is not the right move now
1615540158,if you did the maths on ada too
1615540162,if it had the same market cap as bitcoin
1615540176,it'd only be valued at $40
1615540187,"sure, its doable"
1615540199,but getting a $1T market cap is a loong way away
1615540210,Yeah and that’s fine if that’s your approach
1615540228,But old mate is spouting a bunch of rubbish
1615540286,I’m happy if it hits $3-5 range. Getting 360-370 free ADA a year is pretty nice at that price
1615540304,Let alone the silly prices that people are predicting
1615540304,You're too emotional about ADA. Calm it before you lose money
1615540319,I’m literally 10k up at the moment lol
1615540380,"Dude, we love to help you. But you cant rely on post grads with every trade you make. We are all people with full time jobs... You have to learn how to make these decisions for yourself"
1615540392,"Lmao, you are also too emotional about ENJ. Calm it before you lose money"
1615540444,"i am, and im trying. but someone told me i am, same as what im doing for seven dicks up there"
1615540451,ADA/BTC 6h candles
1615540549,"You’ve been called out for being an idiot. Nothing more. If you wanna keep up the charade that’s fine, but take the good with the bad of spouting absolute rubbish about coins that could potentially alter someone’s opinion of it"
1615540550,"I'd loose too much if I cut my losses on ADA, so I guess I'll just hope BTC doesn't go crazy and ADA catches up. bought in at 0.00002644 BTC per ADA"
1615540585,what exactly is this rubbish u speak of?
1615540627,This
1615540637,ADA is not tied to BTC
1615540656,"Lol. ur a retard. I didnt even say anything, moreso i asked."
1615540665,guys djeezes
1615540676,go in DM and flame on each other :p
1615540711,agree to disagree and let it go
1615540714,"Nah, I’ve said enough. He’s been called out and said I’m a retard for doing so. Good luck enjin."
1615540738,its strange that people are mocking ENJ
1615540741,"Yes, guys please. Dont start beef here"
1615540743,but its like a rocket lol
1615540769,"I haven’t said a bad word about ENJ, it’s been a good money maker"
1615540789,Enj and Celler
1615540792,so good
1615540826,it just feels that everyone is expecting it to drop / correct hard
1615540830,"lol. u have, a lot, but thats not even the point. ADA and btc are tied. Ur just too ignorant to notice"
1615540832,and its like fuck you guys
1615540840,I just keep on going
1615540861,Theres a 0.56 correlation btw. Positive
1615540891,"Enough. Dont provocate anymore. If u wanna do, carry it to dm"
1615540910,ok
1615540922,Ending with this though @seven eleven
1615541495,"So any thoughts on ENJ falling a little until Japan wakes up again in about 10-12 hours, worth selling now and buying again circa 5-6pm GMT?"
1615541605,depends how long the bulls want to push it now
1615541639,Sell perhaps 50% if it approaches 2.18/2.20?
1615541670,"Quick analysis. Not accurate. 
For every 1K of BTC, ADA is tied in at 2-4 cents. Varies based on BTC volume. Lower the BTC, higher the ADA effect. 

Now what happens when BTC falls is that ADA does fall, marginally, but panic sellers and stop losses get triggered, which means it falls more than it should. Same happens when BTC goes up, but there arent many panic buyers and limit buys are not generally set for higher than market price. This explains a lot of whats happening right now. 

ADA will soar, but not in this market. BTC needs to fall once, and rise again. The last fall was just unfortunate. 

My two cents, might be right, might be wrong. Open to criticism please. @IllegalSkillsException @seven eleven"
1615541723,"Also, ENJ seems to have floored at 1.98 unfortuantely. So if you want in, be ready for a loss if BTC drops"
1615541778,Why is ENJ's graph so weird? It's like it decides to climb 2 days before making a pause for 2 days
1615541790,Ans the pattern repeats
1615541790,Japan is strange
1615541800,I guess
1615541805,I've lost money with this assumption. Be careful.
1615541833,The spike today was not within the pattern btw. Spike generally happen at 6am-7am IST
1615541844,Sadly yeah
1615541858,Both my sell-orders went through way too soon
1615541907,"But like I said, at least they went through, so I'm not complaining. Good way to farm more BNB"
1615542070,"It doesn't matter if u do correct prediction or wrong prediction, everyone has their own opinions and beliefs. However you cant call people retard and ignorant, and then say you are open to criticism. Next time, stay away from personal attacks. If you have something to tell to me, do it via dm, not here. Subject is closed here. If u insist on keeping it going, I will have to warn you."
1615542353,"Dude, you need to see what i responded to. You want to warn me, fine. I think iv made it pretty clear that i have no issues with being wrong about something and being told that. The manner its done in is what matters. 
You want to turn this server into some sort of jungle rule, thats ok, its not my server. But you might want to not take sides like this. The only people i argue with here are you, patawik and seven. Theres a reason why im able to have a sensible debate with the rest. Maybe the issue isnt me."
1615542412,"Don't worry, i warned @seven eleven over dm as well."
1615542526,ENJ hitting 2.15 for a minute and then rejected
1615542531,What a ride this morning lol
1615542590,Keep an eye on it. I didnt expect this spike
1615542619,It might be trying to replicate this
1615542708,"@kittiewitty If BTC falls now, i think we're golden"

1615544977,Yeah I might wait to see what they say before opening my wallet. Good thing is they take debit/credit card payments
1615544979,Stc?
1615545124,This is going to be BIG!
1615545395,3rd world signal sorry sent once and must've bounced till it got a confirm on it
1615545414,Which world would that be?
1615545451,"I feel a lot of people including some experienced traders have been getting quite emotional on the subject of ENJ to a point where some want it to tank just to teach a lesson to some excited newcomers. 

Personally and as a total crypto noob I've found the predictions everywhere including technical analysis and hashtag counting but virtually no look at the underlying fundamentals a little disappointing. But then, that's what crypto market has been about thus far, because there has been no real-world application to really talk about. 

At this point I'm not sure how many coins match ENJ in the real world usage share, but I would wager not many. Enjin's partnerships seem significant and their roadmap is promising. But dyor. I got introduced to the subject at work, which was telling for me."
1615545478,South shithole africa
1615545498,Marry me
1615545539,"Awww come on. I LOVE south africa. Dont know about the internet though, but still."
1615545599,"Lol was a police officer here for 8 years, it's a shithole trust me"
1615545619,it doesnt have the best repuation for sure :p
1615545635,"Lol. Ok. Shall take your word on it. I have family there though. Apart from the kids clicking words every now and then, they love the place"

1615545676,You ok now?
1615545696,Yeah private sector security treating me well
1615545698,Almost sounds like you were in Trumps america
1615545718,Almost
1615545786,Look the experience gained was amazing since I can walk into almost any security company globally with my cv but yeah u gotta get out before 30 if u survive that long
1615545818,@Post Grad trouble?
1615545835,So I've got 3k Ada staked when moon? 😂
1615545905,Which coin is this?
1615545935,ENJ is mindfucking me
1615545962,btc
1615545968,sry
1615545970,how can you have 5% swings in like  30 mins
1615545988,3year probably
1615546020,I’v got 7k ada
1615546034,And it’s giving me depression
1615546085,Just have diamond hands
1615546100,Yes diamond hands
1615546113,But i hate ada too
1615546171,Like cant go to 1.1 again
1615546179,And btc is almost 57k again lol
1615546233,Things kind of dropping around. But u don’t rise if u don’t fall :))
1615546264,It’s due to btc not being stable
1615546322,Can ada hit 1.2 today?
1615546331,If it breaks ath and settles at let’s say 59k
1615546341,Then everything is gonna go up
1615546352,I buy long ada x15
1615546360,When it hard dip
1615546365,I ain’t no wizard but I would say a strong no
1615546376,With 1.2 i win 400%
1615546411,I would keep it until 1.7$
1615546430,Which is probably gonna reach with the next breakout
1615546446,Yes but im about to get liquidated at 1.001 LOL
1615546459,If btc fall again maybe ada touch 0.99
1615546471,At what price did you buy?
1615546473,leverage is so risky shit
1615546484,"ADA is still very high. I got in at 0.09 and it blew up, wouldn't be surprised at all to see a slow correction."
1615546498,I feel like its being hyped here but people are so close to being liquidated
1615546498,I buy at 1.07
1615546512,I’d put a stop loss there
1615546518,Thats my top price paid. But I’m breathing lol it staked anyways.
1615546518,Liquidation at 1.01
1615546541,Put a stop loss there
1615546575,In the worst case scenario you can buy back lower
1615546576,Probably i just wait for 1.11 and sell
1615546582,Then buy long x5
1615546588,No high riski
1615546600,Honestly I wouldn’t buy ada rn
1615546624,@Jelle what's your thoughts on StudentCoin ICO? https://studentcoin.website
1615546672,why do you come to that conclusion?
1615546687,I hope americanos wake up and Pump all
1615546694,They won’t
1615546732,crypto is so bot driven :p
1615546734,Probably a red day in stonks and crypto
1615546744,and nobody will bother pumping ADA
1615546816,Hope just reach 1.12 so i do 80%
1615547126,Not even swiss is safe
1615547489,"THink about the use case. This is like ENJ. Student loans, student money, the use cases are infinite"
1615547516,Its so focused that it would be surprising if this doesnt go insane an year after launch
1615548084,ENJ mooning without resistence
1615548135,Damn. I had to say it
1615548159,@JLeh22 Good time to future it?
1615548382,I guess it was. haha
1615548446,i had a 50x enj play that got liquidated at 1.845
1615548455,
1615548461,
1615548468,pain
1615548489,missed out on like 900%
1615548528,Oh daaaammn
1615548539,ow
1615548540,it was only 20 bucks
1615548543,so i dont really care
1615548544,but still
1615548545,pain
1615548549,900% on $20 = ok
1615548554,it do
1615548554,But still. 900% of 20 bucks is not smalle
1615548567,Thats 180
1615548610,900% would be 10x i think
1615548621,yuh
1615548633,9x
1615548637,lol
1615548639,100% is 2x
1615548642,so no
1615548651,oO
1615548671,investing % is weird like that
1615548684,it makes sense but its unituitive
1615548714,You're right. Damn
1615548758,you can use what you did as profit
1615548762,rather than actual value
1615548770,"I FUCKING SPEAK UP FOR ENJ, and IT DOES THIS!"
1615548776,900% from 20 would be 180 profit
1615548793,
1615548826,im actually gonna start funelling a portion of my spot trade profits into my futures
1615548851,margin trading is so fun
1615548856,"The project looks good to me. The partnerships with these universities means that some of the smartest people in the world are working on it. Also great marketing team. Their current road map says q2 is where they want to list on major crypto exchanges, so that is defo something to look out for. Not something I would personally invest in though, but that doesn't mean  the fundamentals of the project are bad.  There are just so many coins I want to invest in, that I have to make choices.😉  My choice goes to data/security projects which I believe could be adopted by in the corporate world or by the gouvernement."
1615548859,which probably means i should stop doing it
1615548962,Thnx guys for advising me to hold 👍🏼
1615548981,niice
1615549115,legit
1615549117,its hella addicting
1615549277,fuck I was gone eating and couldnt cancell my sell order
1615549279,why ENJ 😂
1615549428,Have you sold the lot at 2.20?
1615549594,lol no
1615549601,2.149
1615549607,500 dollar profit
1615549611,guess I just take it :p
1615549636,Nice; I’ve done the same. Now considering what my re-entry point is
1615549658,good question
1615549685,if it breaks below 2.10 it could be like idk
1615549685,"Been an emotional 10 days holding ENJ, don’t want the relationship to end, I quite like her"
1615549692,mid 2.05
1615549701,yea same for ENJ
1615549706,its been giving me a lot
1615549712,and then it pumps when I am out
1615549725,and then it dumps on me 😂
1615549731,Yeah I think that’s a good price; and hopefully spikes again around 8/9 GMT
1615549738,and I always keep going back
1615549751,am I ENJ addicted?
1615549770,Just ENJoy the ride
1615549800,Tradesanta has made ~130 trades on ENJ in the last 12 hours
1615549853,so roughly +5% on top of the organic gains
1615549853,it swings so much its crazy
1615550020,en the candles are so short
1615550032,you have to keep an eye on it constantly
1615550147,Im gonna do it. I am gonna 20 X enj i swear to god :kekw:
1615550405,"Just saying, it could go down soon"
1615550420,Help me!
1615550421,go short
1615550432,It could go up as well
1615550447,hedge a short with a long
1615550491,It could go up and plummet down too
1615550513,This is probably what will happen
1615550528,Funny observation – ENJ-BNB pair seems to perform nicely with the bot. Maybe because it's more even as BNB is also growing. So it's not just upslope but also more downhills as well where to do some scalping
1615550548,Its because they are inversely propotional
1615550561,I was doing this manually with Bake/BNB some time back
1615550691,I think ENJ might have run its course. Downhill now (IMO $NFA)
1615550762,thats what we always think :p
1615550771,
1615550777,"""it must go down now for sure"""
1615550790,and when it hits 100 dollar we be like damn Dazzy was our prophet
1615550805,Im just trying to figure out how its going to do this little maneuver
1615550825,This is so stressful
1615550827,Must be Futures
1615550831,"Wait, Maybe ENJ can go back in time."
1615550841,Stike mine. This is better
1615550844,Don't wanna miss that entery point
1615550856,ENJ?
1615550867,Is that enj?
1615550875,yeah
1615550880,bruh wtffffffffffffffff
1615550881,Yeah
1615550886,after 2 weeks of shilling enj
1615550888,nah this it
1615550889,You forgot a few support levels
1615550890,sell ur bags bois
1615550910,Lol. No. Talking short term
1615550924,To get all the way back there it needs to break a lot of support
1615550928,wow i thought it was gonna hit $3 24hrs ago
1615550947,Down to $2 for a few h *maybe*
1615550951,Projecting only for the next 30 mins tbh. Support would still be at 1.8 i feel. This spike wasnt really warranted for. Its because of the announcement yesterday
1615550973,But nm. Its already gone off my course. Seems to be going back up
1615551002,Do you have any ENJ?
1615551021,Hahaha. Its doing another ATH
1615551057,@Jelle I dont quite understand why theres resistence here. The depth seems clear
1615551188,"If I go in, It'll drop to 1.8"
1615551194,"If not, new ath"
1615551209,Story of my life. I took profit at 2.15
1615551268,And now the amount of $$$ i had at 2.15 is the same as $$$ at 2.2 with lesser coins
1615551287,Sell-order went off at 1.99 :(
1615551296,"WHAT 
THE
FUCK!"
1615551306,I needed some sleep okay
1615551313,You'll get another chance
1615551315,I think
1615551338,Well it sort of broke the resistance
1615551338,Main support still seems to be at 1.78
1615551358,Now it needs to retest
1615551360,"I was pissed because I bought myself into ENJ  before it was going down again, so I just set the limit and went to bed"
1615551365,So now it wont go up because its ready to shoot up?
1615551384,What time frame are you looking
1615551385,Awww. Dont go to bed like that
1615551391,1m
1615551396,Dude
1615551397,Trying to do some futures
1615551411,You cant do ta on a 1m chart
1615551422,It won't go up because it's ready to shoot up?!
1615551444,"Oh, that was only for the picture. I look at depth for predicting short term"
1615551464,Which is why this confused me
1615551474,"Yeah,, like making the M and then shooting up"
1615551526,Was 3am already
1615551567,"Most of the time whenever its up, another 15-20 mins will give you an idea of where its headed. Yesterday i was more worried about BTC falling, so i set a stop loss."
1615551579,And its on its way down now. Keep an eye out
1615551601,You might want to set a buy order at $2
1615551656,So glad I resisted the FOMO-buy
1615551678,😁
1615551725,Thx for your advice 😄
1615551731,"well thats 2 x ICOs I've invested in this month already, waiting for Casper to make it 3. Hopefully at least one will make it worth while haha"
1615551766,"@\MeeM/ Unless somethign drastic h appens, it IS possible that hte new floor is 2.03."
1615551781,
1615551795,Which coin did you use to deposit coinlist? Its 20$ fee on usdt
1615551797,Wouldn't have invested into ENJ if you didn't constantly talk about it 🙏
1615551812,Thanks man. Good to get some validation.
1615551893,
1615552133,"Lurking for a few days, but made a good buck on ENJ because of that"

1615552427,I think its different when no one was being a dick to @felguerr
1615552440,How can I invite people? The invite link from channel is very general.
1615552459,No its not. Use the link it give you. It will be your invite link

1615552525,Its your personal invite link!
1615552557,This looks like just another way of sending crypto from one wallet to another. What is so special about it?
1615552573,Phone or pc?
1615552591,Phone
1615552626,
1615552690,Make sure to put expiry date on never
1615552694,Ok thanks. This works.
1615552710,I tried from channel logo and that is the generic one
1615552713,Ugh I posted the same one twice but yeah edit the expiry date
1615552721,Yeah channel logo one is generic for me too
1615552962,Dammit: Casper reduced the max investment for Option 1 from $5k to just $1k!?!
1615553084,Thats good news actually
1615553090,Looks like ANKR is the THETA of today?
1615553100,Ensures more people can buy
1615553145,I think it's different when Swiss wasn't shoving ENJ down everyone's throat
1615553197,I'm glad they did :p
1615553218,(and that is turning out ok)
1615553468,"Did ANKR and AKRO get listed on a new exchange today, or why are they suddenly mooning?"
1615553491,"Thanks @kittiewitty 
Also, @SeineJanie You've always been my white knight, but you have to realize that resistance can only be fought with resistance. I was never shoving ENJ down anyone's throat, this started off with me addressing that we've lost something BIG by being super dicks to Dazz, who i wish really was here. Instead of tell him he's shilling, the decent thing to do was to tell him the rules here. Instead everyone started breaking the rules, including the admins. I was lobbying for Dazz to be one of you. Not for everyone to buy ENJ."
1615553629,"The only reason i feel that connect with ENJ is because im in that market. Fuck TA, fuck whatever, i know this is something that the world needs right now. Next year, i might change my mind, but with COVID taking center stage, these are the 'hypes' that have any real meaning. All other coins are simply an investment at this point. Again, not shilling. Giving my POV."
1615553656,"Dont forget, Facebook/social media was also a hype at one point"
1615553731,"I wasn't referring to you, I was talking about dazz shoving"
1615553749,And by telling him he's shilling we did tell him it's against the rules.
1615553777,"Also, more to being a Post Grad than being a one-coin fanboy"
1615553831,"Swiss and CryptoDomme have been talking about ENJ before dazz came along. Still lots of profits even without dazz. Now, he could have contributed sensibly, but it was just too damn excessive."
1615553859,We need a new channel for dazz-discussions
1615553861,"I mean, ENJ is still getting on everyone's nerves with how often it's in the focus. This is not an ENJ-focused server. But ever since dazz came along, it feels like it is."
1615553956,
1615553957,"This is what no one understood. He's not a one coin boy. Before ENJ, he's made me profits from XVS, then CRO. Like a LOT."
1615553966,"@SeineJanie true story bro.
And add matic chsb dent tel theta ada lbc cro bnb"
1615553986,ENJ is just that type of coin that deserves this attention right now. Im not even talking about it now. I come here and everyone else is
1615553989,For cro he dm me
1615553997,wish I didnt miss that bnb call 😂
1615554008,He sure made it look like he is
1615554032,I also think he went overboard trying to justify it to the haters. Cant have it both ways can we
1615554044,"On the other group, it was not overboard at all."
1615554052,Ok tell him to come back as we have no pb with him and the rules are already write he should be able to read
1615554060,He wont come back now
1615554070,So thats it
1615554076,I will not run after him
1615554079,I've literally begged him to
1615554093,"Dude, he dm'd me about it, I told him that's good stuff but I'm not interested and he **still went on and on**!!"
1615554110,I make money alone and sometimes with post grad tips in the post grad chan
1615554114,It was borderline pestering
1615554116,Dont care about him
1615554127,And we try to share proper knowledge
1615554131,He's new. I think theres also an element of validation. Something im getting only now from Kitty and mew
1615554138,"But why would he justify haters? I mean if you believe in a coin, you can tell people why. If people don’t listen, their loss if the coins moons. Why would you care so much about what other people think?"
1615554138,Not send buy buy bye bye
1615554145,I know the feeling of trying to keep justifying something or a thought process
1615554149,exaclty
1615554160,Validation
1615554169,"I give a call, I don't care about if ppl say ""nah, not for me"". That's fine. That should be fine."
1615554169,This is people 101 guys
1615554182,Because you are already an expert at this and have been doing this for ages
1615554192,"Still, after being told several times, if you don't respect the house rules and then ragequit like a whiny baby, good riddens."
1615554197,You're the person validation is to be taken from
1615554214,"Fuck that, swiss made like 100 calls that people didnt follow. He is just laughing at them bc he made bank"
1615554217,"No, because I'm a chill dude and I don't get my validation from random strangers on the Internet 😄"
1615554229,"Fair enough, but im just saying, none of us here can do the research he is able to do, but a few of us would be better at ariving to conclusions"
1615554242,The chain is incomplete
1615554252,True bro look at DENT and TEL now lol
1615554266,"So, he's new to the game but he already has a unique skill that no one else has??"
1615554268,Counting his money while the rest is crying
1615554274,who has the money to follow 20 calls 😦
1615554277,I dont :p
1615554284,or how do people do that?
1615554288,sounds highly implausible
1615554292,The number of times i've wanted your validation and the number of times you've given it to me is the ONLY thing thats kept me in crypto. Dont understimate your super powers
1615554296,I think thats even more fun. When no one believes you and a coin goes 200%
1615554325,"Seriously, if that's why you're in it, quit. Emotions should be left at the door. Trade with your head and for max profits."
1615554347,"Sure, if you can boast and get validation, it's nice. But it must not be motivator number 1"
1615554357,ooof ada dip lookin good for buyin
1615554358,fuaaark
1615554360,Good point. Calls will lead you to research and learn about the project. Then buying is if you believe or not
1615554362,"See, i run a company with multiple people in it. I get over 200 recruitment profiles a month. I understand how different some people can be. It might not translate well in other aspects of life, but sometime, a knack is a knack"
1615554379,Should I sell $ANKR now?
1615554404,ETH is getting close to jeremy liquidation again
1615554434,and arf at ADA :p
1615554464,LETS GO
1615554499,my ETHUP just stop-lossed as well
1615554509,"shorted 1inch with 50x at 3.925, closed at 3.85"
1615554513,almost doubled
1615554519,was like +80%
1615554523,bitcoin dropped 3-4%
1615554526,altcoins followin
1615554526,Fuckign BTC again!
1615554531,3%?
1615554533,no way
1615554536,that like idk
1615554551,oh no it is lol
1615554552,2.7
1615554574,I always ask myself
1615554578,Who tf sells
1615554650,If there is any new crypto kid that need just some@quick advice to start making money just ask
1615554668,I dont know you money management
1615554692,fuckkkk i sold my KEY position too early
1615554704,I’m up 25% on my Eth long.. thinking of closing it
1615554705,couldve gotten another 40%
1615554734,Whenever swiss and jelle post stuff i am like
1615554747,"Why are ANRK, AKRO, CHZ and LUNA (and potentially a few others) suddenly falling rapidly at the same time?"
1615554751,
1615554761,Where’s support for ENJ?
1615554768,BTC dumping :p
1615554769,bitcoin is dropping
1615554776,Wtf i sold my kidney for ENJ and its dipping?????
1615554778,Can adults ask too?🥺
1615554790,everything will rebounce when BTC bounces back
1615554794,"Im not talking about that validation, im talking about, ""Hey, is this good because of this, this and this"" and expecting a straight reply"
1615554796,Is it going down. I might be able to setup a futures enter point 👀
1615554811,The issue was that he wouldnt stop
1615554813,Never
1615554814,so annoying 😦
1615554826,just sold my positions on 4 shitcoins
1615554828,ENJ seems to have done well in the drop this time. Last time it was belly up for a while
1615554838,At a dip?
1615554845,I bought the DIP to early on ENJ
1615554849,bummer :p
1615554852,ones i was holding hadnt started dipping yet
1615554867,He didnt stop. Every time i came here he was posting on and on on enj and how his hours of research revealed secrets which turned out to be partner logos on their website
1615554867,"all up 30-50% since buyin in, still worked out"
1615554871,Dont worry about it. You couldnt have predicted the dip
1615554887,But i am gonna try and make a enj profit
1615554909,Same :’(
1615554912,So today I learned that holding different coins is not like holding different stocks. Your portfolio is not diversified when everything drops at the same time because of btc
1615554917,I looked into the stuff you were saying was fake. None of it was. Just FYI
1615554932,omfggg can we stop arguing about dazz ffs
1615554937,ETH is also a solid buy now I think
1615554941,dont even know who the cunt is
1615554944,The other day a client came to me asked me to implement the 'ENJ Crypto' into my platform. So i know its real
1615554945,ADA also I think for a quick profit
1615554946,Great name!
1615554949,"Hey princess, got some ENJ??"
1615554957,Once again. I was talking about atari's coin not enj at that time.
1615554969,ok everything rebounced 😂
1615554970,Dont worry
1615554973,we are safe again boys
1615554974,btc has fuckall buywalls
1615554983,And once again i did research on said atari project and read papers so eh
1615554989,Gaining altitude again
1615555008,If you want to srgue take it to frat chat cause I’m just trying to find some good coins to buy and I can’t cause it’s dazz hour 24/7
1615555009,was way too close to getting liquidated there
1615555011,holy fuark
1615555039,you just missed out on sales
1615555039,"All i said at that point was ""is this from atari themselves or this would get a cease and desist quickly"""
1615555047,again with a different nickname person
1615555057,Hahahahahahahaha
1615555059,Smash buy. Love a sale;
1615555089,at that dip you should really leverage buy shit
1615555101,if only I knew how leverage worked 😂
1615555102,I'm done talking about Dazz. Can feel myself rage quitting soon too at this rate
1615555108,> bruh
1615555112,you literally bring it upon yourself
1615555112,Iknowwwww.
1615555122,Stop. Now.
1615555127,you do though
1615555127,"@felguerr while you're here, what are your thoughts on StudentCoin? https://studentcoin.website You and Jelle seem to have some decent tips for ICOs thats why I ask 😄"
1615555128,
1615555144,you've been the one who starts all the shit everytime
1615555154,WTF
1615555160,STFU
1615555170,1.93 at the dip phew
1615555171,Shut up. Go up. Read. Educate. Then talk.
1615555173,what a buy
1615555176,lmfao
1615555178,1.04 for ADA
1615555186,yeah i bought more ada
1615555221,Who was just talking about futures with ENJ?
1615555229,Its still a good time to go long isnt it?
1615555234,Yeah BNB just took a nose dive
1615555255,But then more is expected right?
1615555265,A bigger dip is coming
1615555314,Yeah 100% huge dip incoming
1615555363,someone look at sands 1m and tell me wth are them wicks xD
1615555378,Can't btc hit a new ATH before starting to dip again ffs
1615555462,look at the coins fighting it lol
1615555470,come one little ones you can do it
1615555502,What’s going on with the market today 😮
1615555532,Look at ENJ still at $2 after the dip (trying to gloat so it falls and i can buy at lower price)
1615555566,Where is BTC-support?
1615555575,1.62 was the last one
1615555584,I dont know now.
1615555591,Too fast to judge
1615555629,CHZ holding well considering
1615555639,I hope BTC support is higher then 1.62
1615555663,Imagine
1615555680,"dont look at you wallet right now, bad idea 😂"
1615555690,😭
1615555694,Yeah let’s just imagine the wallet button isn’t a thing rn 😂😂
1615555701,:kekw:
1615555734,Closed my eth position
1615555735,"I had a look an hour ago and got big depresso, not sure what to buy rn tho, maybe a bit of ADA as it’s cheap? To long 😮"
1615555738,300$ profit
1615555751,Profit is profit
1615555759,Don’t feel like risking it
1615555761,do we know where jeremy his liquidation was?
1615555769,Lower i think
1615555783,I though low 1700
1615555788,1690ish I thought
1615555800,close one then damn
1615555807,Just above what mine was but I got tf out
1615555820,Who says it’s over 😏
1615555830,You guys gonna buy anything today with this all happening? 😮
1615555835,"If BNB takes a hit, shouldnt BTC go up given that people sell BNB for BTC?"
1615555856,its like the ideal time to buy when you have stable coin :p
1615555884,BTC dropping without getting any resistance is pretty uncommon
1615555914,We are in a limbo
1615555914,
1615555932,I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a quite big drop
1615555949,this drop is stressful to watch
1615555982,Really 😮
1615556005,"ok -700 dollar, not the best buying off a dip ever :p"
1615556010,"I think once the positions I have open now close, I'll sit this one out and take a break until monday"
1615556032,You think this will dip till 46K again?
1615556040,not in 1 go
1615556044,perhaps over multiple days
1615556067,So close to ath :/
1615556070,Fuck BTC. This means ENJ will have to moon all by itself! Will take a few hours longer now.
1615556111,Alts are going south
1615556120,ADA 1.02 damn
1615556131,Still saying 0.8
1615556140,I’m down 1.5k with ada
1615556159,Dont worry about it. Will shoot back up
1615556173,My liq point is at .63
1615556178,there was a guy earlier today with a liquidation at 1.01 :p
1615556184,Ok. Worry about it a little then
1615556188,he got bailed out 😂
1615556203,If it goes there i’m done
1615556206,Cmon
1615556211,.63 is mad cheap
1615556222,Dont think it will hit that though
1615556331,I’m getting my money ready to buy
1615556338,If the ship sinks
1615556353,What leverage are you gonna take?
1615556483,Link to the news https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/98138/binance-us-investigation-report
1615556496,If the price drops a lot a 5x is more than enough
1615556691,Think at drops by a lot more?
1615556722,Who knows
1615556772,"Didn’t know that about binance, yikes"
1615556776,we are moving the right way again
1615556780,Prices could be down for a while then?
1615556793,no alt recover quite quick
1615556801,I don’t think btc will stay at 54-57k forever
1615556804,its just when it dips like 4-5 times in a row :p
1615556808,It either goes up or down
1615556817,or when it would dip to 46k in multiple stages
1615556817,"Ah, I getcha"
1615556823,I will cry
1615556824,then we are fucked for a while
1615556828,Yeah hahahaha
1615556829,I’d convert into btc
1615556836,Fr?
1615556855,Cause when btc goes back to the previous swing alts don’t
1615556899,"That’s smart I guess, moving your entire portfolio to BTC when it’s low and then once BTC goes back, rebuy your portfolio for more"
1615556900,It aint dipping mo more
1615556903,"Not saying I would like that, but I pulled out at 55,500.00..."
1615556932,Yeah let’s see if it’s done
1615556946,Why do i feel like half the world is sleeping
1615556955,"Oh wait, cause they are"
1615556973,That half is going to wake up. 50% of them will kill themselves and the rest will sell.
1615557052,sell in a DIP?
1615557066,25% of the world are just killing themselfes
1615557072,I kinda assume many stop losses have been triggered :p
1615557080,"No, because of the news"
1615557094,abandoned wallets make prices go up 🚀
1615557101,binance was already banned in the US?
1615557105,Japanese people running around screaming GOZILLA GOZILLA
1615557106,idk
1615557125,:kekw:
1615557138,YAY! US TO THE MOON!!!
1615557281,BNB is going downnnn
1615557285,thats why btc dropped?
1615557286,Sell
1615557308,Binance is being investigated and BNB stocks are tanking 📉📉📉
1615557312,Japanese kill themselfes because ENJ was dishonored
1615557334,WTF. Thought you were with us
1615557364,I am
1615557389,ENJs run was dishonored by btc drop
1615557397,Ahhhhhh. Unagi!
1615557671,Chz is actually mad
1615557694,He doesn’t know how to drop
1615557812,CHZ and ENJ are at the same level of demand right now
1615557894,I only put $10 into CHZ :((
1615557979,LUNA isn't doing too bad either
1615558107,when do the us get their stimmys
1615558211,i bet whales are doing this to eat it all
1615558239,less than a week
1615558264,I smashed buy
1615558266,Cheap coins
1615558275,It's not a dip it's a flash sale
1615558643,Fuck yes lol blood bath. I’m in red too much red.  The only thing holding me not to sale cut the losses cause it would be stupid to sale with loss. Things will recover. Keep breathing guys.
1615558725,Is there anyone in student coin? I think it will be big
1615558776,Nah
1615558782,Not yet anyway
1615558786,https://stctoken.co.uk/?ref=Sx4s33sg71
1615558801,Please use my referal if you can.
1615558916,"Also, for those who do join. Make sure you share the invite links with people. They give 30% of whatever someone else deposits"
1615558933,"How to double your money 
100x enj at 1.95
Sell at 1.97"
1615558942,THeres no 100x on ENJ
1615558964,Thats also a good way to lose 2x your money 🙂 @NotMatt
1615558965,Oh fuck
1615558983,What’s the max leverage for enj?
1615558985,And this of course
1615558990,50x
1615558992,Goes both way as always
1615559001,"50x. And if you use it now, you will most certainly be losing that money."
1615559014,Yeah but i@hope you do it because you can afford it
1615559020,The voilitility itself will liquidate you
1615559062,I feel like people don’t use leverage for the good reasons
1615559066,"wrong, you'll only lose 1x your money 😄"
1615559082,how much did you get out of interest? Does the person who uses a link get any additional coins?
1615559088,True 😂
1615559092,seeing my position go from -40 to green again
1615559096,%
1615559098,No. I dont think so.
1615559106,walking a knifes edge
1615559107,But then you share and get coins
1615559114,Lol finally did a good move by selling all my Ada yesterday night
1615559128,Haha
1615559130,Waiting for a new entry point 🙂
1615559200,I think it needs to be 2 sided to get people to use a referral link - give the new signee a chance at getting something in return for using a referral link
1615559253,"Yeah, but i didnt get any bonus to signup. 30% Of what you deposit is pretty big though. So i'd take that over some dumb bonus anyday. Already have $120 from invites in there"
1615559323,"Dont rely on these groups for that 30% tho. Mostly friends and family. I believe in it and have convinced most people around me to put in $100. Thats how i have this much only for that. I myself went in with $3000, and Dazz got $1000 from that."
1615559393,What do you think makes it’s going to be big
1615559399,I’m gunna look
1615559422,Its should be right? Student loans itself will be a HUGE usecase. And thats what they are targeting.
1615559444,Apart from other student stuff. Its a huge market. Especially when the edutech sector has BLOWN up in these COVID times.
1615559482,It says page not available
1615559515,Eh? Works for me
1615559530,https://stctoken.co.uk/?ref=Sx4s33sg71
1615559546,@fffffffffffff
1615559547,I have been looking to invest in this it has amazing benefits and is the first of its kind.
1615559555,I'm just waiting for my profits from crypto
1615559556,Exzactly
1615559572,If you don't mind can you please dm me your invite so that it doesn't get lost in the messages.
1615559579,Dont wait. You'll lose more when we jump to Tier 2
1615559592,"I had the same thing, think they sent a referral link, so you gotta go to the student coin website itself as you’re not logged in"
1615559603,Which is...
1615559607,Yes I saw this. But I currently don't have any money😅
1615559615,No. Thats fine. You go directly to sign up and it respects the invite link
1615559626,Oh okay my bad
1615559633,All of them are in trades. I might lose a little but I think there's 1 more phase before tier 2
1615559647,@Cryptoknight I’ll use your referral when I get round to it :p
1615559649,"My advice, and not because i get 30%. Sign up, make account, put $10. Thats it. Share link with friends and family"
1615559655,Thanks man
1615559675,Ill stop now before they say im shilling. lol
1615559800,Eh student coin is already up too much for hueg gains
1615559800,No jokes at all but I've got 8 USD in my bank account😂😂 3 weeks ago i lost 70% of all my money in CFDs. Now I'm just working on making it back.
1615559852,But this trade is the best decision I made... all my money was on CHZ I bought at 0.25 now it's at a 100% I'm positive it'll go up much more by the end of Monday so I sell then and diversify my portfolio
1615559937,They have another 7 phases to go i believe. So that shouldnt really matter
1615560012,0.002 to 0.0138 not exactly huge 😆  its not listed on any 'major' exchanges yet as its still technically in ICO phase. Either way its still a decent price to load up on a few thousand tokens of something that may eventually make $1
1615560068,https://studentcoin.website/?ref=Sxbe3fxri3 if anyone needs another referral link
1615560071,Dont know why he likes starting an arguement.
1615560083,Thanks for stepping on my toes
1615560092,🤓
1615560107,
1615560110,Well but once it's listed there is going to be the usual dump. So it's going to fall a lot before people realize it's potential and start investing in it long term.
1615560130,depends which phase you get in on
1615560139,price goes up the later you leave it
1615560144,Well right now I'm probably gonna get in at tire 2😅
1615560151,And yes it's on my long term hold list.
1615560170,and not all ICO exchange listings dump
1615560170,"The ICOs I'm planning to invest in are GSX, Casper and STC"
1615560177,All of then is at least a year hold.
1615560180,"https://stctoken.co.uk/?ref=Sx4s33sg71
For when do do do it"
1615560231,looks legit
1615560244,Oh lol I forgot I can't post referrals😂
1615560249,GSX - is that the one that has links to that scammer?
1615560249,when was the price 0.002?
1615560258,does enjin have an official discord?
1615560261,Def is
1615560268,Dude I've done my research on it... it looked legit to me.
1615560274,Lol. WOuld be sooo awesome
1615560284,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/
1615560287,I'll anyways double check this news if it's true.. I mightve missed something.
1615560289,"Oh yeah, theres some Casper scam going around"
1615560308,Sigh gonna take it off my list😂 thanks
1615560324,I didnt do much research on Casper. I was just gonna put in a 100$ there
1615560330,No no. Casper is not the scam. Its a scam to buy casper. By someone else
1615560342,Ohhh lol okk
1615560343,xD
1615560349,Casper is on my buy list too
1615560351,Well but you guys should check out GSX
1615560361,Do let me know your thoughts on it.
1615560369,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjjxxp/gsx_techedu_gsx_the_most_blatant_chinese_fraud/
1615560370,It's the first of its kind
1615560380,"so we have studentcoin and casper.
anything else we looking forward to?"
1615560382,"dunno whether true or not, but there's more than one link to it"
1615560409,A ton more. I'll keep updating you guys as and when something conveinces me 100%
1615560416,Oh alright.
1615560421,SYL
1615560433,"The thing is, with more coins, we start putting in less money in each coin. Hence the focus right now"
1615560463,"SYL - can't register just yet - the hosting provider had a major fire, but that's another decent one"
1615560474,link?
1615560544,"Guys, you might want to hurry up. This thing just shot up. 
https://stctoken.co.uk/?ref=Sx4s33sg71"
1615560573,Do you have in invite link for this?
1615560580,yeah but can't login to get it haha
1615560589,oh wait
1615560589,Dude your just shilling with the referral link now😂

1615560591,yeah i do
1615560603,https://www.xsl-labs.io/syl?access=49210
1615560606,Its shooting up. Im trying to help!!!
1615560626,"https://www.xsl-labs.io/syl?access=49210 (but nobody can register/buy at the moment - their servers are down, but their twitter said they'll be back up and running in a few days - they had a server fire at OVH where they hosted the website)"
1615560630,No idea what happened. Its just going crazy suddenly
1615560676,Steems to have stopped now. Maybe was 1 big order
1615560710,Please tell me that sharing referral links will not be the new hype..
1615560721,Come one. Thats still helping the community
1615560743,This invite system thing is exactly how this server got big too
1615560787,So the price in phase 1 was 0.002?
1615560787,30% referral bonus is a lot. Are you sure it's not a pyramid scheme?
1615560798,It seems super legit man.
1615560809,Like its already getting partnered
1615560811,Where does the bonus money come from?
1615560821,Its a coin. Theres no real value to it right now
1615560828,Perception only
1615560889,I dont think it has a market cap just yet. Not sure tho
1615561177,CHZ reached 2 trillion in USD trading volume on binance 😲😲😲😲😲
1615561198,If a selling spree starts it could drop massively. But i hope it finds support
1615561206,"⚓ ⚓ ⚓ ⚓  I don't know who said to buy ANKR a while back when, but I've had 4x since then 😍"
1615561582,I sold it like a jackass
1615561690,"I'm still in, I'm just gonna hold it for the long-term I think"
1615561724,I'd set a stop loss for the incoming BTC drop tho
1615561740,"Guys, ENJ is mooning again"
1615561820,I know
1615561824,where do I sell
1615561826,fear
1615562022,Btc 4hr candle is back in the green
1615562024,You can sell your fear to me
1615562032,@kittiewitty
1615562055,"Wait, are you out of it?"
1615562066,no I jumped in at 1.99
1615562086,but all in with 10k so I dont want to stay in too long :p
1615562100,"If BTC falls again, you can expect the same sort of graph. So maybe put a few orders at the bottom just in case"
1615562146,Anyone planning to buy more SYL when possible to do so?
1615562148,Eh ENJ is only +23%
1615562169,Yeah. Its best to stay away from it then
1615562175,😆
1615562177,I mean kinda
1615562185,I don’t usually buy at +23%
1615562186,You should. Good call
1615562197,"Oh. Sry, thought you were trolling."
1615562202,I was at first
1615562204,"No, wait for 1.95, buy if you can."
1615562220,We're nowhere close to where its going
1615562232,#xem will it fall or come out ?
1615562234,I should’ve bought back at $1 but I couldn’t convince myself it’d keep going
1615562257,Dont make the same mistake again
1615562269,"1.97, if BTC falls. 2.01 if it doesnt"
1615562287,first time I bought at 0.79 and sold at 0.89 or something like that @BuffWanderer 😂
1615562304,Yeah. Me too. This is when Dazz was that guy i know and not god
1615562330,don't you start again 🤫
1615562331,Fuck it I placed a buy at $2
1615562336,dude you are always here 😀
1615562337,If I lose money I’m blaming you
1615562386,Want me to get you two in touch? Could really add value to your research maybe
1615562391,DYOR!
1615562410,I'd love to but Casper ICO soon and also invested in StudentCoin
1615562434,I have him in my dms. What was his twitter again?
1615562436,Soon? Its not out yet?
1615562437,"I have and I’m still not convinced, but games are a big market and if they end up in real estate they’ll moon."
1615562456,Casper 23rd March
1615562464,Then dont invest. Dont go in for a coin you dont believe in. Small dips will freak you out
1615562478,Nah I’m not a paper handed investor
1615562486,I’ll hold it as a side bet at least.
1615562522,Watch out. BTC
1615562525,Maybe
1615562535,Besides VET is gonna make me rich anyways.
1615562555,Im in VET too. Amazing project (other than ENJ).
1615562572,It’s just so clearly undervalued.
1615562635,"https://stctoken.co.uk/?ref=Sx4s33sg71
Guys, time is running out."
1615562661,Its gone from 127k to 142k in less than an hour
1615562769,Looks like Binance will be shilling enj soon 😅
1615562792,YEAH BABY!!! VINDICATION!!!!

1615562877,my metamask is on home laptop
1615562879,fml
1615562882,Lmao it’s okay for someone to not believe in something you do
1615562884,Or see the history to see what the new price might be
1615562939,Sure. Thats perfectly ok. 😁
1615563049,Don't drag me into any fights 😅 I just like to talk about bots and real world crypto usage
1615563100,Lol. Didnt mean to.  Sry
1615563256,"Joking (mostly)  ☺️ the link is kind of representative of what nft's are about now… Which is mostly stupid s***, but also in-game stuff, and hot"
1615563289,"Oh, i care only about the in game stuff. NFT's wont last too long"
1615563422,"In a way they won't no, as in they're not going to be mentioned anymore after every contract you enter and all the license deals including their share percentages and absolutely everything that has value will transfer ownership as nft's"
1615563458,It's not about gifs people
1615563467,Well I got some price alerts set on ENJ so let’s pray for a little dippy
1615563478,is there any SXP announcement coming up?
1615563514,The prices are still high
1615563521,Enj over 2$
1615563528,I suspect people's identities will be nft's before long
1615563531,Btc over 56k
1615563583,How is that kind of blockchain related to the coins we trade on Binance?
1615563584,"if I buy, will I be able to sell anytime I want?"
1615563596,No idea. I dont plan to.
1615563625,Enjin (and others) are building the platforms to power this stuff
1615563659,are you rooting against me now? cruel man
1615563672,lets first have a new peek please 😂
1615563684,Dont worry about a dip in ENJ. Its going to be just fine
1615563699,I want to sell first and then again reenter on the dip :p
1615563719,Just a little dip for me to scoot on in
1615563723,Then up we go
1615563746,Once again i was talking about atari
1615563773,Im pulling your leg
1615563790,what entry are you looking for then?
1615563826,damn i sold reef wtf
1615563864,wauw did reef wake up
1615563871,1.95ish would do me
1615563878,Is that acceptable for you? 😂
1615563890,is it possible to change which coins are shown at the bottom of the Binance desktop app?
1615563902,if its hit 2.09 I'm out anyway :p
1615563902,"If BTC crashes, which it should"
1615563914,@Cryptoknight Just bought £100 worth of STC
1615563923,Looks solid
1615563929,Awesome! Congrats!
1615563959,Question is just when
1615563965,When did you buy it though?
1615563967,@Cryptoknight where do you see ENJ going beyond today
1615563968,"Being a first year uni student and if it does get more adoption, would be pretty cool to see it develop while I get my degree"
1615563975,"No, it's always those three. Just like on the dashboard of the mobile app."
1615563990,I think today is a day of rest. Lol. BTC is the queen today. Lets see what happens.
1615563995,Where do i buy this STC?
1615564003,Phase 65
1615564007,It looks promising
1615564008,I still think a major fall is incoming. @SeineJanie What do you think?
1615564020,On BTC?
1615564035,"Wth, it just went up 0.0001$ between the phases"
1615564039,Yeah
1615564050,"Nah, I don't see it"
1615564052,ok it can drop now @hollowviper
1615564056,I sold mine :p
1615564058,Lol. Thank god
1615564070,BTC is still meandering up on the large scale. 58k will be interesting again
1615564072,I've been glued to my PC to try and short it
1615564092,but there's no reason right now to believe it *must* be rejected there  or before
1615564092,What about when others wake up and see the BNB news?
1615564104,"#xem still falling, will it rise"
1615564109,"So anyway this stuff is kind of what dazzz was referring to when he said Enjin are Skynet… 😄 Stuff sounds pretty out there of course but it's just technology and will take over gradually, and maybe they screw things up and someone else becomes the standard for it all"
1615564125,What news r u referring to?
1615564141,BNB has been pulled up by the US Govt
1615564153,Ok thanks watch it fucking moon now
1615564156,This
1615564159,oh that investigation thing
1615564162,right
1615564187,So noto a biggie?
1615564193,"thats by default the case, it doesnt hurt me anymore"
1615564204,"> BNB, the exchange's native token, dropped by 6% shortly after the news broke. 
There's your answer. It's already priced in."
1615564222,I don't think too many ppl are gonna panic sell hours after the news
1615564227,it's not big enough for that
1615564231,Lol. Awesome. That was sort of anti-climatic tbh.
1615564245,I had a soundtrack playing in my head until now
1615564264,Weak hands selling at the first sniff of anything
1615564265,I have a soundtrack in my head as well. A State Of Trance 1007 👌🏼 😉
1615564271,The fuck?
1615564279,Hehe
1615564718,@Jeremyfto Thanks! My first successful future
1615564731,Now to do it with $1000
1615564738,Add a zero
1615564742,Congratz!!!!
1615564783,Nah. Too risky
1615564794,Not at all! You’re in ENJ 😎
1615564818,Being in ENJ doesnt mean that you suddenly lose respect for money.
1615564836,Oh
1615564841,Idk what happened to me then
1615564847,Revelation isnt it?
1615564858,You lost money?
1615564868,Hmm 1.95 might be too optimistic
1615564893,lol not yet. I did the majority of my investing a couple months ago so caught very good prices
1615564901,I've said it multiple times now. 1.95 ONLY if BTC drops. If it doesnt the support at 2.0 and 2.05 will stop it
1615564933,"Since SaneJan doesnt thing it will fall, its best to leave a sell order at 2.02 or someting"
1615564953,Lucky bastard
1615564957,Sell at 2.02? But it’s going up isn’t it
1615564961,Wish doge had happened sooner
1615564967,He wants to buy
1615564974,I caught vet at .02
1615564998,"Stop it. Theres FOMO, and theres FIMO"
1615565000,"Top 10 proudest moment in hindsight, about 3 places above my wedding day"
1615565014,Don’t tell my wife
1615565033,"Sure, just ggive us her discord and we 'wont tell her' 🤣"
1615565039,👀
1615565052,CHR dropped
1615565088,Thats not a drop. Its a dip.
1615565111,my bad srry
1615565129,"If your in it, leave it alone"
1615565140,what u mean?
1615565157,"Its ok. Im paper hands, not you. 

If you're in CHS, it will go back up most likely"
1615565168,yup agreed
1615565168,thx
1615565258,Don’t paper hands
1615565271,If you’ve got play money in there it’s a lot easier to just leave it in.
1615565287,paper hands?
1615565298,Selling at every dip
1615565304,Some random phrase these guys use for people who panic sell
1615565318,oh i see
1615565320,srry quite new lol
1615565330,Well tbf it’s more the WSB people that use that phrase
1615565332,Do you think BNB will start gaining again when BTC tops the ath?
1615565338,Thats ok. You're in the right place. Keep asking questions
1615565345,thanks!!
1615565367,Lol. Really. WTF! Never using that again. And dont any of you call me Paper hands anymore!!
1615565385,lol
1615565393,"If you're in it, stay. If youre not in it, leave it alone."
1615565403,Stop loss.
1615565411,Too panicy right now
1615565515,yeah
1615565521,not suddenly
1615565532,😂
1615565535,my futures hold on btc is doing nicely
1615565541,bought during that dip earlier
1615565543,LOLOlolol
1615565560,Whats it at now?
1615565571,im up 0.016 btc
1615565600,and nearly at my TP
1615565627,someone think in REEF?
1615565669,REEF is the polkadot solution to liquidity
1615565681,Holding my BNB 🚀
1615565707,"from dex and cex , imagine the possibilities"
1615565747,Is CHZ finished for now?
1615565967,holding or tanking
1615566123,Both ofc
1615566173,"If btc fails again today and drags it down, I'm definitely refueling"
1615566234,Guyss I'm going viral on Twitter 😅😅 CEO of chilliz retreated my tweet
1615566251,His only re tweet today

1615566920,@kittiewitty @hollowviper Your entry is here
1615567129,Wonder if VTHO will take off again
1615567137,All aboard
1615567181,I’d keep an eye on ENJ
1615567205,If it keeps on dropping I’m going in
1615567641,I dont think its dropping any more. It will stay here most likely
1615567827,I’ll just stay out then
1615567828,"My prediction: Its going to make 3 hops, then jump up to the point we think its mooning again. Then fall. One more hop, W almost complete, again false moon. Then fall again to complete its M and then it actually moons to test 2.25."
1615567865,I’ll throw in my prediction (I think it’s fun to see different opinions)
1615567867,https://twitter.com/dazstoke1978/status/1370416480685264903?s=19
1615567900,Drop to 1.85/90
1615567906,Then moon time
1615567909,Over 2.50
1615567953,Haha. I doubt this tbh. Unless BTC tanks again. Which might happen .
1615568092,thoughts on $data?
1615568151,Ask @felguerr He as some thoughts on investing in this now.
1615568181,harmony one making me moist rn
1615568185,hi
1615568208,HELlo
1615568220,I said for long it is still cheap
1615568226,Otherwise no
1615568237,Except if you trade
1615568241,And if
1615568251,Manage your risk and be responsible for the potential loss
1615568282,"Might put a little bit into $DENT, Swiss. Might only get 10k coins but leave it in there for a while :p"
1615568299,It depends of each of you my friends
1615568316,When ?
1615568341,If i enter Enj it’s only in a long with leverage
1615568359,Don’t want to hodl for the next 5 years
1615568369,This would be a HUGE risk right now. You have no idea what BTC is about to do
1615568384,I’m not doing it
1615568387,Correct. Bad idea
1615568405,I know btc is volatile af
1615568420,When i shared dent i didnt even check all the partnership and how it is huge
1615568420,Once THETA goes up to 7.5 I’ll go in :p
1615568423,https://www.dentwireless.com/partnerships-neu
1615568427,Apple
1615568430,"Dude, its recovered in what? like 2 hours. Thats crazy"
1615568479,@felguerr Do stop losses in futures actually work?
1615568496,Yess
1615568502,Shit DENT is with Apple???
1615568508,https://www.reddit.com/r/dentcoin/comments/l8jqod/dent_partnership_with_apple_this_is_why_dent/
1615568512,Guys look at this
1615568527,Ok. So heres what im doing. I put a long on ENJ with a stop loss set to 2.0. Only with 50$ just to see what happens
1615568534,Might go in now for DENT ngl
1615568551,Now it is not really a good idea (except for long term)
1615568559,As it pumped
1615568571,Money management
1615568576,Know yourself
1615568585,And when you are able to prepare fiat
1615568588,Buy the dip
1615568589,What $ are you waiting for it to go down until for you to go in?
1615568595,Or just the dip
1615568596,What’s your leverage
1615568602,
1615568605,25x
1615568614,Big man 💪
1615568625,50$ I dont care if i lose it
1615568730,Bitfinex can trailing stop
1615568742,But not sure in derivative / futures
1615568751,Or could use a bot
1615568764,Im going to test out trade santa today
1615568791,I have my own strat and i am 90% longterm so i dont care but it is my own point of view and it work for me maybe not for you
1615568819,By default buy low
1615568879,"But just remember that when you buy ENJ at the top at more than 1.5, some ppl like me bought it under 0.5"
1615568883,And some lower
1615568899,Thats the game
1615568917,So stop fomo and at the same time want to earn fast
1615568944,The only ppl who makes money fast are x125 cross leverage traders
1615568955,And its like 0.00001%
1615568960,Or lucky boys
1615568997,And most of the time somes normal ppl try to do it with 100$ to 500$ max
1615569635,
1615569735,"That’s fair enough, I’ll wait for the next dip and buy in then 🙂"
1615569883,"I'm seriously questioning the concept of diamond/paper hands. It probably makes some sense in stock where fees will eat up your profits if you make trades all the time. In crypto however optimally I want to be able to buy the thing that grows fastest next, so I really couldn't give a rat's about selling off all of my dearest hodling coins to go on the faster growing thing then jumping back in later should I feel like it."
1615569983,"So really I'm just buying percentage growth, and for BTC it's what, 1500% in the last year"
1615569990,I have friends who are just holding and they do better then me
1615570005,I’m constantly changing and trading
1615570029,He just bought FET in februari and is now *4 with his entire portfolio
1615570043,Yea that's not a bad point – it's really hard to catch only growth if you only rely on your own thinking
1615570056,Don’t you love when you buy ONE at 0.0450 and the next day it shoots to 0.06
1615570060,That's why I'm working so much on my bots
1615570068,Lol so started taking technical analysis lessions. Already started to recognise some of the trends within BTC atm
1615570089,Like 5 lessions in. Just funny how fast you start recognising patterns
1615570117,Brain is quite good at it and bots are actually pretty bad
1615570138,"what bots are good at is buying lower, selling higher"
1615570153,"True, its just I've got them all sketched out on my notepad here. And kinda quizzing myself 😛"
1615570177,You could take in history and just give a Bull or Bear in the program to the user
1615570183,like based on rules loosely
1615570565,@JLeh22 u there?
1615570635,Yea but I'm currently off-topic. Loading the dishwasher
1615570707,"So ur trading enj. Ur in it since 1.2, price is now 1.8. u expect a moon to 2 soon. Now u decide to scalp. Price is 1.8 and there's a clear zigzag pattern.u sell at the topof the zigzag and expectit to come back down. But wait,it's now going up.what do u do?"
1615570748,Dammit it's 2.0 now!!
1615570754,2.03
1615570758,2.05
1615570768,Welcome to my last week
1615570771,BUY NOW ALL OF MY MONEY ALL IN
1615570788,Great. Ur buy in is now 1.8
1615570802,"MORE, SELL MY CAR"
1615570805,Yea that's the biggest reason I use the bots
1615570831,Exactly.was giving an example. Please don't day trade like me.iv stopped cold turkey.
1615570868,I've seen day traders buy the highs and sell the lows out of pure panic.
1615570885,Hi. Hello. Nice to meet u.
1615570910,Nice to meet you too.
1615571033,I was looking for a server to talk about blockchain development but I found this one instead. I'm happy to be here.
1615571035,"So I figured – bots for the microtrends. They sell some at 1.9, then buy back at 1.78, sell again at 2.02. That's what they can do really well.

Manual trading for big moves. Decide which coin to go in on. Seek for a lowish entry point. Take bigger profits exactly when it starts to feel good and not a moment later, don't be greedy."
1615571053,@Alanox
1615571076,❤️
1615571098,Wasn't sure if I was allowed to invite him to the dev server
1615571119,"If he’s a dev, go ahead"
1615571123,Join the Okex exchange pump tonight! #📆pump-calendar 1000+% expected!
1615571141,@Kyle
1615571147,"Ohh, I would definitely like to join."
1615571173,lol they're affiliated
1615571207,Oh. Lol.
1615571218,🤷‍♂️
1615571228,So do we all participate?
1615571236,Risk free scam free?
1615571256,ha
1615571259,Definitely not. No pump is risk free and most are not scam free
1615571291,And them being on the calendar does not guarantee scam free. Even so called ”fair pumps” are usually also pre-pumped
1615571291,Understood
1615571358,"Tomorrow, let's u and me test out the future bot. I see big $$$ right now with that if it works"
1615571378,I am the admin of Coin Pump Station... When I see a pre-pump I will cancel for sure! We are all about honest pumps!
1615571406,Btc dumping again
1615571427,Ok. Ill be watching. Which coin should I keep an eye on?
1615571429,"Great, need to prepare"
1615571463,I mistake in bot and you will get yourself liquidated
1615571469,I'd be happy to join the dev server @Cryptoknight
1615571492,lol 🙂
1615571519,join the Okex exchange. or you can join our live stream
1615571752,Ask alanox
1615572502,@Jeremyfto what does reduce only mean in futures
1615572536,@Cryptoknight where does ENJ go today?
1615572562,"No clue. Btc needs to stop fucking around.until it does, were at 2.0"
1615572575,fair enough yeah
1615572588,I'm staying on the sidelines until btc has calmed down
1615572602,"Hadit not been for btc, we would have been at 2.8 by now"
1615572620,Ur not in enj anymore?
1615572629,I closed my positions last night
1615572629,Chance for a new ath approach today on ENJ?
1615572632,I'm doing futures
1615572643,"I think so, if btc doesn't slam dunk"
1615572644,Ahh
1615572672,"```A reduce-only order will only allow orders to be placed that will reduce the number of open contracts in an existing position. If you enter a quantity larger than your existing open position, the quantity of the reduce only order will auto-reduce to the size of your open position. Take profit (market and limit) and stop loss (market and limit) are all reduce-only (forced).``` AKA If you create a sell order when you have a long position or a buy order when you have a short position, it will only reduce your current position. It will not change your position direction"
1615572702,"so lets say I have 13 ETH long and I try to sell 14 ETH. Without reduce only, it will change my long into a short position"
1615572706,BTC has been going down at that time for 2 days now
1615572714,with reduce only it will only sell my long
1615572725,Yesterday ENJ just didn't care :chad:
1615572768,You normally want to have reduce onlys enabled unless you are trying to ride the waves and change directions on a whim
1615572799,and CHZ doubled in 24 hours
1615572799,Im pretty sure binance has RO enabled by default
1615572808,literally 100% since March 11th
1615572827,Neat
1615572835,And I bought chr
1615572842,One letter difference :’)
1615572847,hahahah one letter
1615572859,"chr is now on futures, so it's tasty 😄"
1615572886,"worry not, chr's time is coming"
1615572895,"chr's market cap is only 220M, that boy is gonna rocket"
1615572895,Already bailed
1615572898,aw.
1615572991,I just have to take some long term Ico positions soon
1615573019,What's this Dev server?
1615573103,Ahh. Ok.that makes sense. Like a change your mind mode
1615573135,Exactly! Without RO you can switch directions of your position
1615573147,with RO it just reduces your position to 0
1615573156,Chadcoin servee
1615573190,Cool.dont think I'll use that for now. Might try it with 5$ or so
1615573505,Did I read someone saying ENJ usually has a bit of a bonkers moment when Japan wakes up or something?
1615573578,Who knows
1615573679,Not me
1615573731,"30 minutes till the Okex pump by coin pump station  Letsss goooo

Pair:USDK 

happy friday ❤️"
1615573743,It is NOT a happy Friday
1615573746,From what I've seen.... yes
1615573748,Sometimes
1615573755,Sometimes it remains rather silent
1615573770,As long as silent doesn’t mean downwards
1615573796,Depends on btc :p
1615573834,btc's gonna make me cry today
1615573841,I fell it
1615574993,Do you think Ada will fall below 1$?
1615575116,It was 1.02 today
1615575124,na
1615575128,So falling below 1 is not that crazy to imagine
1615575156,buy walls at ~1.00 are insane
1615575166,"Tbh, I think the bulls and bears are playing a game on BTC today.
""Guys, let's draw as straight of a line as possible"""
1615575179,I’m done watching the market for today
1615575187,I’ll just stay out for now
1615575196,Have good night everybody
1615575201,Goodnight not myself
1615575203,🙂
1615575416,@Jeremyfto if you had stayed in eth would you have hit your liquidation point?
1615575576,It's a tug of war
1615575653,Lmao some day I will tell my grandchildren that I observed wars every day
1615575690,The wars for maintining crypto at highly inflated amounts when compared to fiat
1615575718,"well it was called highly inflated back in the day, now sitting at 1 million 💀"
1615575796,Elon just tweeted
1615575802,Fuck bitcoin
1615575826,no. 3 dollars off
1615575835,def not a comfy 3$ tho
1615575862,also the OKEX pump didn't even change the price of the graph 😂
1615575873,"Well, no he said its an anagram of his company"
1615575880,It already happened?
1615575888,wow 3 off hahaha
1615575890,yep. 4 minutes ago
1615575892,would have been so scary
1615575898,the price didnt change AT ALL
1615575900,Which coin?
1615575901,😂
1615575906,WGRT/USDK
1615575926,Oh not on binance
1615575928,also why is everyone creating their own USD stable coin
1615575931,Lol
1615575939,It was on OKEX
1615575945,Coin Pump Station
1615575953,I didnt participate. Just watched it
1615575961,Lol.
1615575969,So much for Collab pumps
1615576188,Anyone here actually used KuCoin
1615576357,Isn't that like a china only exchange?
1615576419,No lol
1615576421,I used KuCoin back in the day
1615576425,Not anymore
1615576464,Oh wait. Is this by the Kuber company?? Those assholes are super acammers
1615576488,"First result ""Is KuCoin a scam?"""
1615576491,lmao
1615576516,"Yeah, a lot of people have had bad experiences with them"
1615576530,Sucks because they have a lot of the lesser known coins on their exchange
1615576537,That's why I wanted to know if anyone had used them
1615576546,Kuber also has a app called coinswitch in india. Wanna see a scam?
1615576614,Install the app.open binance and coinswitch. See the rates. Coinswitch is about 18% more expensive to buy and 7% cheaper to sell. It changes the prices based on your investment into a coin
1615577067,Kucoin 🙋🏽‍♂️
1615577073,THETA is making me depresso but I’m sticking it out for the long run so we’ll see what happens in the future 🙏🏻
1615577091,How does ‘what’ autocorrect to ‘gay’
1615577091,BNB throwing my whole week off
1615577093,Okay iPhone
1615577102,Means you're typing gay way too often
1615577107,For whatever reason
1615577110,;)
1615577116,Hahaha that’s bad
1615577124,I should stop doing that lmfao
1615577134,Depends on context
1615577139,;)
1615577339,Yeah seen it. They should not have hypef that announcement lol. well at least some people have been able to cash
1615577411,People actually invest in BNB?
1615577425,Scamcoin
1615578232,I got scammed out of £2100 😢 beurax exit scammed
1615578405,ENJ moving
1615578415,theres an investigation on BNB rn
1615578420,thats why it dipped this morning
1615578433,Still holding
1615578454,same
1615578464,lol
1615578477,i love my scam coins
1615578479,they wont investigate anymore when their paychecks are in BNB 😎
1615578487,this must be people coordinating this on ENJ now right?
1615578493,Love centralization in my defi
1615578495,I dont get it :p
1615578533,ENJ is better than every pump-group tbh
1615578536,Heyyy I’m making money on ENJ.
1615578540,God I hate that sentence.
1615578553,I should exit
1615578556,doubt
1615578566,it will dump before I decided
1615578576,This is the way.
1615578577,Relatable af
1615578583,ignorant
1615578583,Set a limit
1615578590,Explain
1615578601,Is BNB not centralized?
1615578612,"BNB is, but not binance smart chain"
1615578621,"potential is in BSC, not BNB"
1615578657,...is BSC separate from BNB?
1615578669,actually yes!
1615578679,they have even though about rebranding Binance Smart Chain
1615578679,Then why do I have to like BNB
1615578682,to not include the binance name
1615578687,Lots of BSC projects do good when BNB pumps though
1615578727,"ehh simply because it centralized exchange is convenient rn, ceo has stated they are ready to switch to dex whenever consumers demand it, but seems like consumers dont really care rn"
1615578737,Need i mention ENJ again. Some might even call it the longest pump in history
1615578753,I think BTC has the longest pump in history
1615578763,In a way it’s been pumping since like 2010 right
1615578764,Yeah. This is true. Cancel mine
1615578776,also a long dump
1615578781,ENJ is the coolest
1615578783,almost 3 years off dumping
1615578804,And the winner is...... @kittiewitty !!!!!
1615578807,"I actually use Binance.US so I can’t talk too much against it, but I do feel funny buying into a coin one entity has complete control of."
1615578836,BTC has three years of dumping?
1615578849,"i can totally feel that man, but wrong to call it a scam lol"
1615578857,6 years if you include the next 3 years too
1615578864,Well that was more shitposting lol
1615578883,Are we not like just under BTCs all time high
1615578901,"It hit it like, two weeks ago"
1615578917,And it’s almost back to it now
1615578938,Worst year ever for Bitcoin 😂
1615578943,"The problem is, BTC's all time high is more like a drunk guy who's taking sterroids, and also doing coke, and is constantly getting some sort of infection. Its a very different type of high"
1615578965,Look I want my alts to hit too but saying BTC is dumping or will dump soon is somewhat ignorant imo
1615578983,BTC goes to hyperbolic first
1615578985,Yes it’s a dinosaur but you cannot put a price on being first and having that name recognition
1615578991,i see a further parabolic btc rise before quickly transitioning into a 3 year bear market
1615578991,and then alts pumping :p
1615578994,yup
1615579011,You're right. Dinosaur bones are super expensive to buy nowadays
1615579025,💥
1615579036,Calm. Im just trolling
1615579038,I know a bones guy that can hook you up
1615579047,@BoNeS ?
1615579072,I know a guy you can hook up with to bone
1615579108,"If you say Kanye, im going to lose my shit"
1615579127,🤣
1615579171,So who is on board the LUKSO train?
1615579406,watched the site
1615579425,little bit confused what the current state is
1615579469,Why is CHZ all of a sudden up 50% as compared to 2 hours ago? Did something happen?
1615579544,Hot dam
1615579551,jesus christ
1615579601,it was at half a dollar an hour ago
1615579604,wauw what happend there lol

1615579837,cant explain 😂
1615580025,Hi the exchange froze and nobody lost any money actually. all the orders were cancelled
1615580159,PSA stay away from CHZ for now because it's volatile as fuck
1615580159,:kekw: please ada dont
1615580168,trade it ONLY if you know what you're doing
1615580176,you're more likely to lose than gain from this coin rn
1615580178,Time to future it
1615580183,it's pumped and dumped by whales
1615580205,even if you know what you are doing
1615580211,its pure gambling right now
1615580238,exactly
1615580247,in the mean while BTC drops a little
1615580256,alts flying down
1615580259,never a dull moment 😂
1615580286,https://www.benzinga.com/node/20148211
1615580388,interesting thx for sharing
1615580526,chr is being pumped too
1615580529,this stinks
1615580543,stay away from CH[] coins for now lol
1615580585,"this pump is so artificial, ew"
1615580590,pls don't lose money on this
1615580594,I'm so glad that I bought bar fan tokens on chiliz a couple of weeks ago
1615580597,do it only if you got good experience
1615580639,look at this diversion
1615580656,been holding chr
1615580658,"within a time frame of a few seconds, chz dumped AGAIN and chr is now pumping"
1615580665,someone is playing with fire here
1615580690,pump my chr plz
1615580691,lol
1615580712,it's bound to dump so time your sell if you're gonna sell
1615580742,STOP LOSS!!
1615580786,"reminder again, this is an artificial pump, be careful"
1615580878,Who's doing it?
1615580893,no idea
1615580894,boom
1615580898,whales most likely
1615580907,it's too big of a coin for some discord group to be responsible
1615580915,I'd guess whales
1615580917,"sry, i just wanna have fun with the pennies i have in my wallet 😛"
1615580939,there it goes
1615580940,back down
1615580975,"sadly, they probably ruin the momentum on CHZ"
1615580993,I'm afraid so too...
1615581002,it's still doing ok tho
1615581106,which crypto scanner do you use ?
1615581154,what is a crypto scanner?
1615581180,basically what a stock scanner does but for crypto
1615581185,oooh
1615581185,scans for tech analysis indicators
1615581191,tradingview is the best imo
1615581208,what are you parameters for TV ?
1615581236,coin pump station will be having another pump in 30 minutes on kucoin because Okex was garbage 🙂 I will be live streaming it
1615581357,you should tell us the coin in advance !
1615581458,@plan_national  sorry ❤️
1615581498,don't you have a bot? 🙂
1615581600,no lol
1615581869,anyone buying MKR?
1615581977,yes yes nono?? supports optimism
1615582777,I’m excited to see how the stimulus checks next week affect the crypto market :p
1615582852,The youtubers led to some people having crazy expectations
1615582864,like 10% of all the money into btc
1615582886,Would literally be 100.000.000.000
1615583001,Who bought Lukso? LYXe
1615583010,Seems like a decent medium term hold
1615583015,On what exchange is it?
1615583039,Kucoin
1615583054,Bilaxy
1615583065,So you don’t think there will be a noticeable change in the market then?
1615583067,anyone use either? 😂
1615583073,Nah 😂😂
1615583203,I think there will be one
1615583224,I just signed up to KuCoin but their app is rubbish - it won't let me sign in despite singing into the website fine
1615583229,But way less noticable than people make it out to be
1615583289,Yeh... Utter rubbish that KuCoin exchange. It confused the hell out of me
1615583291,We're lucky when 0.25% of the money flows in right away
1615583352,BTC looks like it's in trouble.
1615583384,BTC needs to wake the fuck up
1615583388,where to get lukso then
1615583389,A imminent dump is inbound
1615583391,:(
1615583399,Yea BTC gonna drop
1615583403,Nw
1615583416,the bounce will be the ath for eth and bnb tho
1615583448,Cmon enj hold on
1615583452,What I don't get is why the heck is reef pumping
1615583652,Its crazy how ENJ follows btc right now
1615583673,This ain’t going nowhere :p
1615583682,Guys i have a question(probably a stupid one but i cant seem to find it) i am trying to sell my btc and just sell it for dollars but the btc usd pairs are moving which is something i dont want always on binance talking
1615583700,Hoping for another ENJ pump in some hours
1615583713,How do you mean they are moving?
1615583717,Usdt is a stablecoin
1615583725,Move it to there
1615583735,I mean yesterday i tried to do it and i changed to usdt
1615583751,And the money lets say was 10k in usdt
1615583773,And after a while it went to 9980 and kept moving like it was a crypto
1615583790,"I just want it to stay ""still"" if you see what i mean"
1615583798,Until the time comes to use it
1615583808,Yea that’s usdt
1615583838,So there isnt anyway for my money to stay put?
1615583849,Yea in usdt 🙂
1615583857,But its moving hahahah
1615583867,Yea but close to nothing right
1615583892,It will never make significant moves
1615583897,The money i have is way more but i lost 400bucks with that
1615583919,"Yea cant Explain that, perhaps someone more senior can"
1615583924,:/
1615584070,"On what, Binance?"
1615584268,"USDT isn’t always gonna be 1:1, it’ll fluctuate in itself and of course the larger amount of money you have in it the bigger the fluctuations might seem"
1615584301,It’s not fiat
1615584325,Or is it? idk
1615584355,So there isnt any way to just keep your money stable for a bit?
1615584376,Just convert into regular USD
1615584381,I just rechanged to usdt and i m down another 200bucks...
1615584387,There isnt usd choice
1615584395,"But those aren't 100% ""stable"" as well"
1615584425,Should i just leave it at usdt? I mean it cant go like 5-10% up down no?
1615584452,Most of the time it's a weird binance-issue
1615584481,"The money fluctuates like crazy, I click on it and it's still the same amount"
1615584482,It’ll fluctuate with the market whilst it’s in USDT but you’re talking like 0.999-1.001
1615584499,Ok thats good enough im ok with that
1615584511,So I think what you are noticing is not exactly BUSDs fault
1615584512,If you’re converting it back and forwards are you not just losing it on fees?
1615584525,I just dont to want to wake up with 5% on something i dont know about
1615584539,I don’t know if there are fees for what it is you’re doing but I just assume there’s always fees somewhere
1615584578,Well ok i can see losing like 100bucks on the fees but my sum of money fluctuates from -50 to +50bucks
1615584602,But if you say its stable i am ok
1615584616,I just need to have the most money possible for tommorows pump :P
1615584648,Be careful
1615584648,And then for next sundays pump from another group that will be the sh1t!
1615584661,Have you participated in pumps before?
1615584686,Yes but i wont enter if i see this pump not having good volume and duration
1615584734,Just make sure you don't regret it
1615584740,The last pump i was in got cokcblocked by sell walls and lasted 2minutes hahah
1615584760,This time it will last longer
1615584767,Good luck on that!
1615584784,To be honest i dont know if this group here participates on the pump i ll join.
1615584806,It will have 60k people on(but i expect max half of them to participate)
1615584833,THETA betrayed me
1615584875,Oh I know THAT feeling
1615584881,Hahah yeah it did that to me yesterday... Went in at 7.15dollars and woke up to 6.85 the movement wasnt that good so i bailed cutting losses
1615584899,Didn’t realise Binance fucking sends you a text message when you liquidate
1615584901,"Who needs a pumpgroup if you have chz, chr and theta"
1615584904,im down 400 bux since yesterday and a big chunk of that is THETA
1615584936,"I don't get it, how can liquidation be higher than my entry prize. And my pnl going down when price increases"
1615585005,Its because you opened SHORT
1615585018,Damn
1615585021,You’re shorting
1615585027,I'm going to get liquidated
1615585032,lol xD
1615585038,Good it's only training money lolz
1615585042,next time check twice
1615585054,Didn't even know there's something like that
1615585339,"So when you are shorting, you want it to go down. When it goes up, you lose money. Your liq point is always when your personal money in the position(base + added margin) equals your loss"
1615585518,think THETA will go back up? 😔
1615585614,So say you got into ENJ at 1.95
1615585655,And it dips to 1.93 but you wanna add more to your position. Is that a thing? Like what changes by doing that?
1615585676,I’ve only ever added to my position when it’s been higher like starting ETH at 1485 and adding more at 1700
1615585810,Theta brings money non stop 🤑
1615585876,If you had follow what i said

1615585897,And also before
1615585908,🤦🏽🤦🏽
1615585941,when you add to a position its always (base position weight * base position cost)+(Added position weight * added position cost) / 2 to get the new cost
1615585954,"If you buy when its lower, it will lower your entry price"
1615585958,"My mate got in at 1.9 and had to sell at 3.9 because he needed money, he hates himself now"

1615586365,Sly and casper are better cuz they are ICO
1615586370,I take that back. Your liq does go down as long as its the same leverage amount
1615586387,Did you see the reason why they pumped @felguerr ?
1615586393,You guys are really cute ☺️
1615586401,CHZ ?

1615586516,The CHZ CEO was the winamax owner
1615586521,"I had $100 in it and exited at $150, it would've been around $1,600 now"
1615586532,I saw a french interview of him end of year 2020
1615586539,"dont feel too bad. I lost 2,250$ yesterday"
1615586541,And understood his fuckin plan
1615586550,They invested 50m to expand to the us market
1615586550,ouch
1615586552,No way
1615586563,Ya thats like 3 weeks salary 💀
1615586583,That has prob something todo with it
1615586595,Imagine an experience CEO in that fuckin betting games going to something similiar in crypto
1615586595,I actually dropped down to 500$ and got it back up to 1500$ riding the ETH waves
1615586599,For sure it pump
1615586610,And from end of year to now
1615586618,He just accelerated partnership
1615586632,He already has a big big portfolio
1615586632,"If it makes you feel better, I had 1000chz this morning which I bought at 0,50 and things stagnated while everything around was dipping so I was happy to get rid of them without losing money at 0,51"
1615586636,So easy for him to grow
1615586717,FUN

1615588666,hell ye! bring it on!!
1615588876,"Silly question, but is it worth converting my spare money into BUSD or something similar to prevent it from going potentially down if I left it in BTC?"
1615588990,tbh its very reasonable to think of BTC as stocks now. It may have dips but its pretty much always going to go up
1615589008,For short term you can use a stable coin though
1615589023,"Great, thanks man:)"
1615589139,I am 100% in usdt now :p

1615590328,y u say this?
1615590380,it just pumped
1615590385,ENJ recently stopped following BTCs pattern and went on a rally to ath
1615590387,I'd wait till it rebalances
1615590417,Depending on where it dumps you can't really go wrong
1615590448,it was at its low of 1.93 just a couple of hours ago
1615590460,"it's a bit violatile, so I'd give it some time first"
1615590476,it will find its new support
1615590490,We'll see
1615591584,"Very much agree even looking at BTC price history. After 2018 great crash it probably wasn't clear for everyone if it was ever going to recover but now I think there'd be few people to think that. I'd surely sell something valuable to buy more of it if it dipped.

What one has to be careful with though is investing large sums in crypto that you might have a need to urgently withdraw in the next year or two."
1615592285,"@Post Grad This is not an ENJ question. One of you at some point said that you think ENJ is going to fall bad soon because the BB's are getting narrower. What does this mean? Is it that when the pingpong inside the BB starts to get smaller (less volitility), the price would shoot in some defined direction?"

1615594850,You'll have to wait after launch for it to be worth that much. But very possible tho

1615600415,"quick question about adding margin to the current position in futures... it decreases the liq. price, but is that additional dough that I put into the margin lost money? or do I get it back after I close the position?"
1615600435,
1615600450,does this help anyone
1615600607,That additional money is part of the pool ABLE to be lost
1615600617,Think of it as extra insurance
1615600643,"Let see if Ada keep going down I set a buy order at 0,87 during my sleep 😂"
1615600649,"In decreases the liq because when you get passed -100%, it gets eaten to hold the position open"
1615600716,"Eaten isnt a good phrase for it as you even if it digs into your added margin, if you get dug out it doesnt go away.It gets used to hold the position open"
1615600741,perfect explanation
1615600746,I get it
1615600768,thanks man!
1615600825,"No problem! Remember that added margin is very similar to lowering your leverage. If you find yourself adding 50% margin for a position, you might as well just half your leverage"
1615600870,"Added margin basically allows you to fine tune your leverage amount. If you arent using it for fine tuning, you are prob over leveraged and compensating"
1615600959,makes sense

1615610851,"Learned my lesson im in now, not sleeping on other coins again"
1615610963,That's bad I really feel for you.
1615611026,sometimes it happens but u get a 3% discount
1615611034,"this time, pay 40% extra :-)"
1615611049,Ok
1615611157,ENJ is taking its sweet time getting to my TP mark
1615611177,I just needed a 1% gain cause I was 10x leveraging trying to get 10%
1615611229,lmao
1615611231,hopefully u get it
1615611256,oh im sure I will but its being slow as fuck
1615611293,I think I was wrong about the math. trying to get to 2.2 from 2.13
1615611301,so 7 cent change
1615611405,Just got the calculator out. I wanted a 4% gain apparently
1615611413,so 40% profit
1615612205,"Oh hey, @bcdcdaz! You're back!"
1615612564,"@felguerr Thanks for the LUKSO call! I've looked more into it, and it's really promising!
I mean, NFT is all fun and games, but ""phygital goods""... Man, that's gotta be the next thing! I think LUKSO is gonna be my ENJ. 😉
Still waiting for a decent entry point."
1615612879,What the fuck is this NFTcraze all about
1615612888,Sounds like a scam
1615612938,
1615612941,Im still waiting on my TP to hit on ENJ. I just wanted 4% gains since I was 10xing it and its been taking FOREVER
1615612953,"Well, that's a typical hype cycle for you. Non fungible tokens in itself are a great idea. But then you have people who pay ridiculous amounts to own a hash for a screenshot of the first tweet on Twitter."
1615613001,"Doesn't have anything to do with NFTs themselves, it's just ppl going crazy trying to ride the hype train. Disillusionment about to follow."
1615613018,After that comes the phase of serious applications and stabilization.
1615613046,wym
1615613046,I totally agree. I think NFTs are here to stay but their hype prices are not. Eventually people will stop paying 1000 ETH for a gif 😂
1615613053,U literally OWN the tweet
1615613054,🥵
1615613064,I own ALL your tweets

1615613275,you should meditate to skip straight to enlightenment
1615613327,It really is a good representation though. lots of people dont realize how hype works and they fall for it every time
1615613333,its like a scam without a scammer 😂
1615613354,Everybody scamming each other with FOMO
1615613608,my ENJ TP is about to hit after like 4 hours of waiting 😂

1615631455,I'm great me up to almost £700  since I left
1615631517,I saw what you said earlier about lukso and enjin lol
1615631518,What Alts are going up pump when people take BTC profits? 🤑🪙🚀
1615631546,I've not heard of lukso
1615631583,I didn't either until @felguerr talked about it on the podium
1615631597,But it looks very promising to me

1615631662,@Cryptoknight  yes I cannot wait for full speed as I believe she hasn't even hit full power once yet
1615631663,Physical assets. But not like NFT's. Like Virtual land
1615631663,ooof
1615631678,@SeineJanie Were implement virtual land in one of our platforms. This LUKSO thing seems interesting. Where do i go?
1615631681,"What is virtual land, give an example"
1615631695,Like a virtual vase???
1615631702,Or like a virtual action figure?!
1615631729,"'Like how you flip a house. You can buy virtual land like in minecraft, build on it, and sell it. Think larger than a game"
1615631730,https://twitter.com/lukso_io/status/1369968852134682628?s=21
1615631733,ready player one
1615631746,"Yeah You can buy them in enjin, plus enjin ultimately control the govornments network"
1615631773,"DUde, everytime ENJ falls like this, my heart pumps now. And not because of the fall. For whats after"
1615631775,I need to google an example
1615631780,Cool tho and I will look into them
1615631783,I cant picture this
1615631835,Go to decentral land or second life. You'll understand
1615631846,"When someone says to me enjins dying, stfu you don't understand her"
1615631871,Exactly
1615631873,"Btc pumps, alts go down"
1615631881,"It dumps , alts go down"
1615631889,Are you looking at the BTC pairs maybe?
1615631893,I found atari land casino plot for sale
1615631899,No usdt pairs :p
1615631931,@ kitty enj has very little correlation with btc
1615631945,but it dropped
1615631948,quite a bit too
1615631952,"Watch the film ready player one too;  although it’s still someway off the games and peripherals are ready it’s just at the wrong price point for mass gaming to adopt quite yet but when they do, a coin like ENJ will be perfectly placed to dominate this multi billion dollar market"
1615631959,Good time to buy CHZ?
1615631962,Not really. Its still higher than yesterdays floor
1615631964,"Yesterday everytime btc moved, ENJ moved with it :p"
1615631985,In the downtrend atleast lol
1615632034,everything will scale with btc to an extent
1615632039,the correlation between the 2 is -1 /0.58
1615632047,More coincidence and more based on exchange activity rather than ENJ being earned / spent in games
1615632068,The entire market moves when btc moves :p
1615632084,the massive binance nft hoodie comp that launches very soon
1615632098,Not with ENJ. Iv seen it go both down and up on BTC tiny moons. Its just coincidence. We cant ignore that trends can be common as well.
1615632120,When it happens 4 times in a row it’s not coincidence lol
1615632123,Plus you're about to be buying property with enjin lol
1615632152,It can be right?  Because theres still a reason why its moving with it - the market trend. Peoples behaviours
1615632180,Its because people have stop losses in btc pairs that are triggered on all coins
1615632182,takes 3 use cases to make a pattern
1615632191,Im sure its the same with ENJ
1615632196,Ofcourse
1615632215,Its not ENJ related its just the entire market
1615632288,fuck
1615632290,enj keeps falling
1615632292,6 days until we leave for the actual moon now anyway
1615632293,And it has been this way from the day that altcoins were born. ☺️
1615632294,I entered too early 😦
1615632328,Entered what?
1615632331,are you looking at 1hr plus charts?
1615632366,5min
1615632367,lol
1615632375,I need to see the drop in detail
1615632377,If you enter enjin before $5 then you picked her up in a sale
1615632381,I entered long on enj
1615632390,What leverage
1615632398,You didn’t say that at first
1615632400,"but I have liq, so it's a little riskier for me"
1615632402,You won#t need that long
1615632406,5x
1615632415,You are fine
1615632420,it picked back up a bit
1615632424,$2 solid
1615632427,should be okay
1615632435,Yeah don’t worry
1615632436,100-2000k%  before the end of the year
1615632475,yeah can't hold that long
1615632480,funding fees would eat it all
1615632483,:kekw:
1615632502,Ooh enjin is for life
1615632511,lul sure
1615632515,works for me 😄
1615632582,Lol. So apparently the new floor is 1.95
1615632585,"2000k%?!? So 2,000,000%?"
1615632604,2k%
1615632614,Okay that makes more sense
1615632650,Hope you didnt pull out. We're back up

1615633924,"also a lot more ppl in japan are staking rather than selling, the japanese know good investments"
1615634040,I stake today as well

1615634407,Don't think so. It's called aenj
1615634429,"I suppose it doesn't matter, since it's a wallet"
1615634445,No I've read every white paper
1615634480,everyone is using enjin as they have the ultimate scaling plan in place
1615634527,The minecraft thing itself is scale enough for me tbh. That shit is going to go enjsane
1615634530,enjin run networks for 66% of the fortune 100

1615635014,You got a source for that?
1615635020,"Yes that was the original partnership announcement, since then samsung, enjin and windows have teamed up to launch the biggest blockchain ever jumpnet and e-finity"

1615638174,Does anyone know if Vidya is something special or just another gamercoin?
1615638239,Coinmarketkal is great for analysis of a coins history as it has every event or press release tagged on the charts
1615638285,Bro what is this bullshit

1615639028,"Fucking buy a dump truck load of Nano, VET"

1615639376,Ooh good point
1615639432,"They wanna be like ""WDY if someone gave you some free money and you happened to put that money on binance?"""
1615639436,Casper ?
1615639480,This
1615639504,Im not American. Is there a stimulus planned for you guys?
1615639523,I think any stimulus that comes will make me bullish on crypto
1615639555,"I missed a 100% on CHZ from roughly 600 to 1200 sats, but now I bought the dip and I'm back in the game. 💪🏻"
1615639573,It's recently been signed into law
1615639579,You see CHZ going up 10x?
1615639587,did my stream deck fool me or i just saw a 60k btc?

1615639801,"It is but will get higher soon, just watch what happens over the next few weeks, then you will see I know what I'm on about for the next time"
1615639839,I'd be happy with another 3x
1615639895,did anyone get in on the nft wars pre-sale?
1615640289,I expect a steady increase in enjin for the next 2 hours before a dip and the next big push tonight
1615640333,expecting another dip?
1615640436,It's not really a dip but for those day trading it is
1615640547,Right on cue she starts turning it up
1615640861,There might be a chance to enter chz again
1615640950,"I kinda don't like when BTC goes to an new ATH. It gets spotlight, some altcoins make gains, but then all those gains are lost and then some when BTC corrects by 4% lol."
1615640986,It needs sustained slow growth for altcoins to avoid crazy volatility
1615641153,You guys know where I can buy xrp in the US? Other than uphold and bitrue
1615641218,This is not signal but take look at $BLZ if it dips again to 0.34- 0.33 band
1615641223,From here DONT ENTER
1615641229,some one can buy it for u and send it to ur wallets 🙂
1615641271,Damn I have to find someone I can trust to do that

1615642307,Think its too late to get in on that action?
1615642314,Wait until the fact that enjin work with ocean finance and governments becomes public information that doesn't take a week of digging to find

1615642531,Offday for the alts :p
1615642532,Ummm. it already broke
1615642538,2.17 is peak
1615642556,Cant believe enjin white knight was white knighting for a reason
1615642566,It was 2.28 yesterday when I woke up
1615642575,2-3 day growth chart
1615642577,it's really struggling to keep 2.0
1615642582,I get that btc caused this
1615642590,Dude! I was paper hands. And suddenly im all in on a coin? Doesnt that mean something to you!
1615642620,"but motherfucker, if btc does something again, enj will just fall even deeper"
1615642621,"Not really. This is every 3 days. See the daily chart. We can expect a slight rise tomorrow, and day after, it hits the new level"
1615642627,It wont
1615642630,ETH is strong today damn
1615642630,then I get liquidated and ciao amigo
1615642650,If btc drops ENJ will drop
1615642652,Guaranteed
1615642661,"Better still download some of enjin games and earn free enjin, this increases the amount of enjin hodled and in turn raises price"
1615642693,"Now if BTC drops, ENJ will drop a bit, but as btc keeps dropping, it will start accelerating upwards and if BTC now hits the 47k mark again, we're already at 3.5$ or so"
1615642708,"if enj dropped from 2.08 to 1.91 during the initial btc swing, god help me if btc does another swing while enj is struggling at 2.0"
1615642711,fuck my ass
1615642715,But this wont happen. BTC is looking strong
1615642716,If btc hits 47k from now we are all fucked :p
1615642738,"Bruh, your long position is another matter. You're only worried about liquidation."
1615642742,Could we just kiss and hang out instead?
1615642744,Whats your liquidation price?
1615642750,"Enjin has to many sectors under control to fail because just 1 dips, 2 or 3 would have to collapse to even cut her"
1615642761,"clearly, I wouldn't want to lose the investment"
1615642765,"you know what YOLO. I am going to put more in. 
I want to set a market stop for 59300 to put 75% in a short 50x 
I would like to, at a given point in time to put in more
Do I just set another market stop at that level? Or do I need to do more"
1615642772,Whats your liquidation price?
1615642779,1.89
1615642785,Ooo.
1615642792,Little risk imo.
1615642803,Cant you add more to bring that back to 1.74 or somthign like that
1615642810,yeah I probably should

1615643051,He left his 20+ year career at microsoft to join and lead enjin on their mission to takeover and improve the blockchain forever
1615643079,Damn
1615643080,Not that guy then
1615643108,He is now enjins chief innovation and marketing officer
1615643125,Damn!!

1615643151,What a hero
1615643166,Money drives people.
1615643184,Microsoft doesn't pay as much as you probably think
1615643197,Is he their Chief Enjineer now? Tehehe
1615643212,True
1615643219,No but he launched the whole azure platform
1615643237,That’s been driven from Redmond
1615643238,that powers the whole network of microsoft
1615643244,Not ms Switserland
1615643270,He is involved with Ms Western Europe
1615643279,But the big guys are in Redmond
1615643380,I still don't get ENJ's weird day pattern
1615643388,2 day move
1615643392,2 day sleep
1615643401,Look only at 3-4 day patterns
1615643447,If you take the time to read the azure rewards whitepaper and look at the ms endgame goals for this you will understand
1615643521,"azure rewards is the next ms office but for nft and blockchains learning, development and reward"
1615643567,the aim is to ship it bundled in every windows and to become the educational standard for teaching this subject
1615643846,Not only money for a job. You won’t have the same feeling working for a big company over a startup
1615643905,MS is a great employer tho :p
1615643928,Lol. Not even in the slightest
1615643945,I have family working with them. They are simply a stepping stone
1615643967,They are in the same building like my employer
1615643976,"Great offices, good work life balance"
1615643978,Im talking about WA
1615644020,Washington?
1615644023,Yea
1615644032,Was googleing to frantically check. lol
1615644035,The city or the state
1615644044,The head office at Redmond
1615644065,I have been there but I don’t know anybody who works there :p
1615644074,Just people from Belgium who are in the team
1615644081,But they are allowed to work remotely
1615644082,Derivitive work culture is all i can judge
1615644094,What is the short form of this btw?

1615644680,I took the long profit this afternoon before new ath
1615644688,I wont short
1615644700,Woah. You went long at 57K?
1615644717,ITS A MAD MAN
1615644730,"No, he must have been pretty sure somehow."
1615644745,If only i could be too. I'd stop losing fucking money!
1615644799,But thats fine. I have like 1.5M in crypto right now
1615644802,You are all in on ENJ
1615644808,You must be loaded by now
1615644809,:p
1615644819,This is my 1.5M
1615644838,We're not even 3% there yet.
1615644847,End of april is my target
1615644854,Woa hope that some day I have that amount lmao
1615644858,- someday -
1615644862,For 1.5m dollar end of april?
1615644876,"Its really cheap right now. Buy 5000 ENJ, you'll have 1.5M"
1615644894,1.5m doge?
1615644905,Hahaha. Funny
1615644920,But HEY! Dont speak that way about my precious
1615644921,So basically you are saying 300x end of april?
1615644946,"Oh, sry. Miscalc. I meant 4M"
1615644959,800x
1615644961,"Btw, THIS is shilling."
1615644964,so 1600 USD
1615644967,lmao
1615644979,"But no, 100% faith in ENJ, not worried about losing money elsewhere because of that."
1615644990,I do feel like i have loads of money right now tho
1615644991,Crypto is the only place I’d like to be a bottom
1615645008,Might want to read that back to yourself bud 🤣
1615645025,"What was your starting amount? If you don’t mind me asking, I’m just curious 🙂"
1615645033,Buy at the very bottom
1615645064,I wonder what amount I should target
1615645073,Not 1.5m for sure :p
1615645079,Guess that will stil be 10% of BTC's market cap if i calculated correctly
1615645099,"Did the same, it actually makes sense even without TA, it was definitely going to a new ATH. I took profits and im in eth now :)"
1615645114,"Well, i started off with 15K. Lost about 6K in the whole doge scandal in Jan. Then there was the whole ADA thing so had a total of 5K left before i met Dazz. Went all in on ENJ because i believed in it, but didnt listen to dazz about day trading. Did some, lost more money there, now i have a total of 8K after all those losses."
1615645142,Entered ENJ at 0.9
1615645158,wait no 1000x ENJ IS the current market cap of BTC
1615645167,"Ouch, bit of a loss - and did you say you’re up to $1.5M?"
1615645170,Dont compare it with BTC
1615645174,Yeah I am
1615645185,I have 5K enj. Im already super rich.
1615645188,"Sheeesh, you’re set for life mate"
1615645210,Compare this with the guys saying they have 5K BTC right now.
1615645221,"Ooo. Nova seems pissed (oh. nm, thought it  was novu warning me)"
1615645230,"You lost 10k without freaking out, you definitely are super rich lol"
1615645238,60k aGaIn BtC gO DoWn PlIs
1615645261,My FA wont let me invest more than 1% in crypto
1615645302,wait so you got $150000000
1615645308,dang why u in crypto Kappa
1615645315,Lol. No
1615645364,Your math is horrible 🤣
1615645375,looooooooooool he is saying his $8k worth of enj gunna make him a millionare
1615645379,"True, maybe I should not be doing crypto"
1615645400,Not what i am saying
1615645433,"Well if ENJ goes x1000 it will, i definitely dont think it'll happen tho x)"
1615645459,"I love how LTC is like the underdog atm

BUY DOGE
SELL BTC
BUY ENJ
BUY NANO

LTC: Imma just go up steadily 27% in a week"
1615645469,"I am saying that regardless of whether i feel like, dont feel like, am or am not a millionaire, losing money in futures to the amount to $100 doesnt bother me much because i cant lose enough that ENJ cant recover and still fill up my account. Must i spell out everything?"
1615645475,But you said you were further up the convo? I'm confused
1615645497,.
1615645525,.
1615645545,"Also, im talking ONLY about crypto. Not real life."
1615645585,*confused*

1615645679,ARGGH! The conversation started with someone asking me my starting amount. We established that i lost 8K. Sympathy was given. I said its ok cause im already a millionaire with 5K ENJ. THATS IT! Forget everything else!
1615645706,I always am. Stupid real life job!
1615645715,On saturday?
1615645716,I didnt mean that. I love my job
1615645724,"I need BTC to stay over 60k for a little while lol. And i wouldnt recommand shorting it now btw, i might wait till it starts to seriously drop (like under 58,5k) and ride the wave at a high leverage"
1615645727,I run the company. No Sat/Sun for me
1615645739,ah fair enough
1615645751,@Nova is 59.2k also good?
1615645753,Wait one Enj is $300?
1615645759,This is like the only place i can come to and act like a complete bafoon.
1615645759,"So million $ in your pocket, are going to stop working irl like me at the end of 2021 ? Or you already stopped ?"
1615645765,Weekends are overrated lol
1615645767,"For me, it is"
1615645777,"Uhm
Ok"
1615645803,"Awwww. your'e like one of those cute BTC haters from 2002. Come here, lemme give you a hug"
1615645807,Just slacking at work for some years and get payed till they fire you
1615645817,I have no idea only thing i know is that next dip is going to hurt
1615645821,Bleed the Fuckers
1615645827,i would invest in real estate and keep working
1615645828,Bad!
1615645828,Lol
1615645851,"Lmao yuup, already pulled 50% out of my DCA BTC account and put it into ETH"
1615645860,Real Estate is not the best investment anymore. Please check with someone aquianted with it before investing.
1615645887,Yea make sure you check before you spend your virtual money lol
1615645893,"BTC hater? Lol no. But it's like me sayin: ""I have 1 BTC so I already own $3 million"""
1615645897,Planning on doing the same when it starts dropping
1615645923,"No, you're in 2002 saying that meh, BTC is only $2. Not realising that in 10 years, you're a fucking whale"
1615645930,IF YOU HAD KEPT IT
1615645943,If I was more sure of it going up I would have also waited. Did it at 57700-ish
1615645957,GOD DAMMIT! Missed my window again. Thanks @Vincent Scott
1615645969,?
1615645974,What window
1615645977,What's outside
1615645988,Wanted to short BTC to earn more money to put into ENJ
1615645997,Not your fault. Just being dramatic
1615646007,Are you trying to day trade when you said only a few messages ago you lost a lot doing just that
1615646029,Learn. From. Mistakes bro 🤣
1615646033,No. Futures. Just discovered those yesterday. Panic trading before the SEC bans it
1615646122,"Thats safer ig, i lost a few 100s $ on futures on the 1st few 57k tests  too lol"
1615646151,Would it be wise to short now?
1615646221,"Not yet imo, especially at high leverage"
1615646233,Even IF a new trend has started. It will still have to recover to about 57000-ish to stay in the trend
1615646233,that's my plan sit in the office trading all day
1615646234,@Cryptoknight you shared some good point but you definitively made a big brainwatch on ENJ when there is like hundred of different subject in crypto world
1615646263,I am starting to lose faith when i come to this chan
1615646274,And there is still no level up
1615646282,Ppl talks about leverage and enj
1615646302,"No new sharing about evolution of eth for this summer, new blockchain consensus"
1615646309,News about spark
1615646312,Flare network
1615646320,And big big big announcement
1615646326,Flare finance
1615646332,^^^^
1615646369,"Futures are a fun way of making money x) and ETH is definitely my long term bet. But i feel this channel is more about day trading than long term stuff, even if theyre super important too"
1615646398,No this chan his not day trading bro
1615646399,@Alanox  Maybe we could have a day trading channel?
1615646401,I'm in long with all my coins
1615646402,@felguerr @Alanox Would you like us to take the ENJ talk to a different server. Thats fine too. This is only for the community we are doing this.
1615646406,The other day we were talking about possible outcomes for the aENJ token
1615646416,If you want day trading better to catch some specialized calls
1615646419,This is a good idea
1615646450,No you can talk about day trading
1615646453,Here
1615646456,No pb
1615646460,But it is not only
1615646475,And this is not the ENJ day trading chan
1615646499,@felguerr where do you find info about those things? I'd much prefer to discuss those topics than this constant ENJ chan
1615646504,"You can talk about ENJ here, no worries. But there are many other ways to make great money. #🎓post-grads-podium is full of them."
1615646510,"Oh ofc, that just what we were talking about at thé moment"
1615646527,"But then SOMEONE needs to talk abotu something else. I was talking about BTC now, and you brought back ENJ. So super confused. Also Dazz has mentioned several other coins. No one is talking about those. The ENJ talk is what the people want clearly"
1615646530,i feel like its more up to people to actually create long term ideas
1615646544,SLP/ETH W forming again
1615646549,Sure we just @Post Grad abandonned cuz we saw so much about enj
1615646556,Where do I find this please?
1615646584,You need to be Sophomore or above. See #🔼ranks
1615646597,
1615646605,Naaaa statistics showed it the chan is full of enj since more than a week
1615646609,Ah Ok and invites are how I get ranked up then
1615646620,"confused, what does this mean?"
1615646633,Correct
1615646635,Nm. Didnt know new users cant see the channel
1615646661,Thats a good thing btw. It means people will make more money
1615646672,Can someone tell me about the free btc on swiss?
1615646680,How much do i have to put in?
1615646684,Scam?
1615646693,Really get enough of your stupid answer
1615646698,not scam
1615646703,And you said chsb is a scam
1615646703,its an invite promo
1615646705,Pfffff
1615646707,.....
1615646712,It’s posted on post grad
1615646714,although i dont know the specifics
1615646717,I said it was a scam? When?
1615646732,Lol. Im super bullish on CHSB. WTF!
1615646736,Here ? Or you ask correct ?
1615646750,Also maybe a weird idea. But the name of this discord is pump fraternity. but pumping is not primarily the goal of the community it feels
1615646755,Or maybe misunderstanding
1615646765,FREE BTC SCAM! LIKE EVERY OTHER SCAM! Damn why so sensitive?
1615646767,Corrext
1615646778,pump = short term
1615646792,"People talk about anything they want tho, and im not in ENJ, just been watching it a little but its true its impressive atm"
1615646802,"What do you guys think about :
SAFEMOON
NTRC
?"
1615646811,what period
1615646846,Who told the contrary. But what do you expect from@this place
1615646919,People sharing views on crypto trading and answering eachother's questions. And i think this channel is doing  pretty good :)
1615646924,"Ok. I need to clarify this. @felguerr @Alanox 

ENJ is bullish, ENJ has potential. Hence we talk about it. 
I am 100% in on ENJ, so apart from ENJ and BTC, i will rarely talk about something else. 

Now, if someone else wants to talk about another coin, thats on them. 

So far, no one is talking about anything else based on your stats. 

So i have no idea what you guys want."
1615646970,The community bring knwledge and try to understand the fundamentals
1615646976,There is more than money
1615646979,You are senior
1615646983,You do the work
1615646985,Did anyone manage to get in on that Taraxara before end of ICO?
1615646986,You share
1615646990,Dont care of your bags
1615646997,The community coulnt grow like that
1615647026,@Cryptoknight look i am ok with all you share
1615647032,Really
1615647035,No pb
1615647056,Maybe the issue is that you re the only senior who did some deep research in what you believe
1615647066,And others not
1615647070,Im definitely not confident enough in my skills to share calls. People who want to do this are free to do so tho
1615647072,Thats why they didnt shar
1615647084,This is not about sharing calls man
1615647086,"This means nothing in this context. I have never claimed to be 'senior' in terms of knowledge. Im far too new for that. Apart from what i come across, i have no time."
1615647090,Sharing ENJ is OK. Just make sure to find where the line between suggestions and shilling is 😁
1615647101,"See, now YOU make sense."
1615647138,"People talk about every coin they want. If there is no one else to bring up more coins, then the whole chat is ENJ"
1615647147,"@Alanox Btw, i will shill sometimes, but when i do, i make it very clear with a disclaimer stating ""I AM SHILLING, MWAHAHAHA"""
1615647162,and also understand that people may be tired of hearing ENJ all the time so it will bring less users into that discussion
1615647167,Like this
1615647182,🤦🏽
1615647185,I do
1615647217,Read rule 6
1615647255,Have never told anyone to buy anything. Not confident enough for that
1615647272,"Of course if someone asks when to buy, i give my opinion"
1615647298,decent activity from NEO happening lately (looking at usdt pairing) although im struggling to make sense of it. looks at first glance like its at a decent price point considering the recent patterns
1615647335,I suggest you to choose XsL labs or boson protocol for ICO
1615647354,XSL labs looks great tbh
1615647372,I hope we all win with that one
1615647389,I am bullish also on AKT and NGM
1615647389,considering putting in more than my initial plan of 100
1615647397,Where is this? Not on binance?
1615647404,new project
1615647407,Ah
1615647417,https://www.xsl-labs.io/m/
1615647443,"Its an ICO right now, but yeah, looks promising imo"
1615647469,take a look at their whitepaper
1615647480,I suggest you guys to have a look on AKT and NGM
1615647483,https://www.e-money.com
1615647498,https://akash.network
1615647512,Potential big gems
1615647516,i wish i had enough funds to put into more of these projects actually
1615647517,In next months
1615647527,hopefully i get some from xsl labs tho
1615647531,Both have use case
1615647535,Especially akt
1615647540,For the cloud offer
1615647543,ill look into it
1615647554,Is there anything that points to this that is clean news tho? Cause the website is super scammy
1615647576,why do you think that?
1615647582,I didnt get your point really
1615647589,Maybe my english is too bad
1615647597,But i feel like you so agressiv
1615647599,"I mean, best not to judge a product by the website, but i dont know anything about the coin yet."
1615647607,And argue with so few reason
1615647611,"No. Relax, not at all."
1615647613,maybe go learn about it then
1615647618,Ok
1615647621,
1615647629,Lol
1615647630,whitepaper is very easy to find
1615647631,"Again, THIS DOES NOT REFLECT ON THE PRODUCT"
1615647651,Ok @Cryptoknight  xsl project is based on privacy data
1615647655,"Yeah, i have a lot of apps that run that give me these metric automatically."
1615647672,My DENT has gone up 25% since last night 😮
1615647678,Ahh
1615647682,So thank me
1615647692,"I only put a tiny bit in tho so I’m a bit salty, and yeah all credit goes to the beautiful @felguerr ❤️"
1615647709,👌🏽🙏🏽
1615647721,And i think you miss the first call on it
1615647723,"Wow, it does look interesting"
1615647752,"Yeah I did unfortunately, I’m new around here, going to be following your future calls extremely early!"
1615647757,They would like to build a system based on SDI secure digital identify
1615647760,Thats a crazy market cap isnt it?
1615647770,In which you dont share your own data
1615647802,But the blockchain will confirm that it is correct personnal data
1615647817,You dont need to share anymore your name etc licence everywhere
1615647823,You share you private key
1615647837,And the network already know thanks to xsl
1615647837,"btw, what are our thoughts on cspr btw"
1615647847,offering is soon
1615647848,That it is compliant
1615647852,they just got accounts back
1615647857,Ahh. They're replicating the server-client auths over the blockchain now. Could be huge
1615647889,31 march end of ico
1615647896,Then the mobile app
1615647902,Then partnership
1615647913,They will start on binance smart chain
1615647920,Then will move on pulsar
1615647922,Their own
1615647936,its a pretty sweet deal so far
1615647958,Its still super cheap. Much more than STC
1615647963,I have a good feeling about SYL
1615647987,I bought phase 2 at 0.002
1615647993,It is already 0.003
1615648000,Made 50% before the end
1615648001,Lol
1615648002,i entered at 0.003
1615648020,do you have to provide KYC to purchase ico?
1615648023,Really hope it Works for’us
1615648028,I remember that call and left it a few days and it went up to 0.003 😭  still super cheap
1615648030,Yep
1615648059,You think there'll be a further phase going up to 0.004?
1615648072,I dont know where it is going to be listed
1615648086,But when you know be ready for you re strategies
1615648113,You could either sell it directly when it is released
1615648119,Or just hold
1615648247,I mean come on. Still. $100 gives me 30k coins. Imagine if I had 30k of ada right now
1615648256,exactly
1615648290,".I mean if be losing my shit right NOW, but long term thought"
1615648301,That's why I'm putting min $100 in most ICOs. Wish I was on the ball like this over the last 2 years
1615648303,The risk worth it
1615648321,At least it is more than leverage
1615648322,Lol
1615648336,BTC bout to hit 60
1615648391,Already done but if again would be happy i did a new long hahah
1615648394,X125
1615648412,When should I put in a short?
1615648473,"Hard to say you know why ? 
Two different pow, TA vs social news, politicals and market wish"
1615648492,Hype is saying bullshit
1615648514,Why are there so many scammers on this channel?
1615648521,Ta says down while hype says up?
1615648530,Scammers?
1615648545,Cause people keep falling for shit
1615648552,Loads man
1615648559,What type of scam? lol
1615648560,Dming all the time still
1615648566,Almost that
1615648586,"Ah, that's nothing we can stop unfortunately"
1615648593,You can turn off DM's for the server
1615648594,Yeah. I know
1615648612,"I have already received 6 messages from pages where they give you BTC for a promotional code, and you have to deposit them $ 600 to release your deposit"
1615648621,It's worse with other servers tho.much worse. This is the only server I have where dm is on
1615648634,The dms are not the problem
1615648637,ummm ok ok I'will
1615648642,But those damn friend requests
1615648650,Got 10 of them in a row yesterday
1615648651,Agreed
1615648659,yes it is...
1615648664,Oh yeah. That's so fucking pissing off.then you have people who start calls.
1615648682,Just turn them off for the server they come from
1615648693,WTF! hahahaha oh boy! what anoying!
1615648707,"HOLY fuck boys. BTC breaking $60,000"
1615648714,U can also screenshot and report here. Mods will ban them
1615648720,So @Cryptoknight so what if you use the same approach you did on ENJ to find and suggest the new CHZ potential like
1615648733,CHZ made 6000% in three months guys
1615648741,Thats the ticket for millions
1615648752,Credit for this goes 100% to @bcdcdaz . Not me. I'm just the spokesperson.
1615648789,chz is making waves as it is also enjin hodl and see what happens after the japan/asia launch
1615648804,CHZ just had a weird spike on BUSD chard
1615648808,oh btw
1615648809,can someone give me the current LTC fees
1615648820,like transfer fees
1615648886,https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-transactionfees.html

1615648942,dyor
1615648951,@bcdcdaz could you explain to @Cryptoknight that before you left we were sharing in a good way info in dms 😉
1615648957,
1615648968,And that i was already in cro and enj
1615648978,SYL or Casper potential? :chad:
1615648989,I don't doubt that one bit. You were never the target for my flaming. It was the others like the Belgium cunt and patawikshit
1615648995,we had numerous convos in which I shared and recieved good info
1615649015,What did I do
1615649023,I miss the convo but i think they were joking no ?
1615649025,Leave my country out off it!
1615649030,Lol what??
1615649043,👍🏽
1615649046,Oh ok you don’t mean me ok
1615649055,"Yeah, but dazz was not. Anyway, let's not get back into that"
1615649062,Really dont know but i bet on XSL
1615649080,"All you need to know,is if anyone targets dazz, they deal with me more than him."
1615649083,"@That one belgian super cunt last time I was here, I only had a mobile to track and analyze charts and data now i have the power of a laptop and cryptowat.ch"
1615649113,When is the next stream bro?
1615649166,"Oh welcome btw, didnt see u join lol @bcdcdaz"
1615649221,😂
1615649262,He doesnt need your help and if there is some trouble we will try to calm it
1615649279,No need to make like we are in the street cuz we dont
1615649295,It was gonna be tonight but I'm still digging up juice and anything I say in stream has to be 100% verified as I don't want to get a bad name
1615649332,"qkc guys, you wanted a different coin and topic. keep an eye out"
1615649351,Too late QKC tweet on it already made the work
1615649360,It was good like one day ago
1615649370,Still could get some %
1615649379,But was better
1615649382,Yesterday
1615649392,Yeah but they on mainnet now and launch defi wallet 2.0 next quarter
1615649417,I know but as you already know i am afraid ppl are not mid long term here
1615649431,So if they expect entering now and make 400% overnight
1615649481,"I agree and is a very valid point, all my investments are mid to long hodl"
1615649495,👍🏽
1615649577,"oh, binance related question. i cant remember if you need to confirm identity to make purchases and transfers on and from binance, do you?"
1615649584,i know you need to for some things
1615649593,but im not sure if its needed just for that
1615649705,I dont remember but i think it is needed for a certain amount of deposit and withdraw
1615649711,I think you have a limit right?
1615649716,Without verification
1615649820,yea
1615649837,friend is interested in xsl
1615649842,would be their first crypto
1615649925,how to get past xsl kyc? am american
1615649956,Lol. I know that of course. I'm just saying I take it personally now.
1615650014,Stc is also one to look at for that.would have loved if that was my first crypto.wouldnt have lost on doge

1615650645,Hi all did you hear about Pi coin
1615650709,"Yea people shill it all the time here, you can mine it on your phone and earn peanuts with it"
1615650779,Anyone staking in Alice?
1615650812,a little bit
1615650815,@everyone
1615650821,rip maroon
1615650826,you will not be missed
1615650830,You cant. :kekw: i could buy and hold SYL for americans. If they trust me
1615650841,wait! thats illegal
1615650855,@Kyle ban pls
1615650866,concept is good
1615650873,shilling is not
1615650892,Pi is closed source unproven crap with people suddenly having the app upload gigabytes of data
1615650893,why this is not selling
1615650937,this is new concept vs a lot of energy consumption
1615650948,"""new"" concept ok"
1615650949,!warn @maroonmaroon  no shilling
1615650949,
1615650956,social network based
1615650974,I accept it but sorry did not
1615650978,please read the #📜rules
1615650979,pi isnt that young
1615650992,understand that as some promo
1615650993,"Oh iv seen pi. Wonderful idea, absolute bullshit implementation. No go for me."
1615651019,for now pi is more like a ponzi scheme than anything
1615651030,Exactly
1615651057,Could have been really big.but slim chance of anyone using that concept again after the ball drops.
1615651075,but world is going in some unexpected direction look at doge look at all other  alts
1615651091,"i actually do ""mine"" pi simply bc i think the idea has at least some merit in it. there isnt really any harm in holding the coin is the way i look at it. and im not losing anything by doing it. and on the off chance something does become of it, ill have something to take advantage of it"
1615651093,really
1615651100,you could pick any crypto in the world
1615651106,and you choose to reference doge coin
1615651112,"Lol. So ur saying that the world if going in an unexpected direction, u choose the worse one?"
1615651129,I literally was typing the same thing 😂
1615651136,Heh
1615651146,"you should NEVER use doge as an example for the direction ""the world is going"""
1615651217,"its a hype coin with zero purpose, zero white paper, and infinite market cap. There will be a time where it equals nothingness and the amount of purchases it would need to ""get to 1$"" is astronomical."
1615651248,Perhaps if Elon tweets about it
1615651255,not even then anymore
1615651265,thats run its course
1615651266,With his referral code
1615651277,might be something left in it
1615651278,"Sure, ""Guys, forget doge! Check out Pi"" 

Dont think that would really work either"
1615651281,but $1
1615651282,nah
1615651329,@maroonmaroon How much do you have in Pi right now?
1615651334,"Doge is one of those things that we will forget about and then, out of nowhere, someone brings back the meme and it does a 10x"
1615651345,Pi aint gonna be worth shit
1615651348,Somehoe i doubt this btw.
1615651364,trust me if it was going to be anything it would've blown by now
1615651370,DOge is the exception to a bunch of rules no one followed
1615651395,Do you think we’ll see it pretty high on the chart forever?
1615651419,How can it grow some more?
1615651442,Now an Elon meme/tweet about it is not going to change much
1615651450,"I mean, Doge is pure hype at this point. At some point that hype will become something. Like a movie star."
1615651480,All in all i liked doge
1615651482,"Dont get me wrong, im not pro-doge or anything and have lost 50% to it. But i call it like i see it"
1615651491,I bought it at 0.01
1615651502,Hype is an underdog of the biggest nature
1615651504,And sold way too early at 0.045
1615651515,But I remember having a good day
1615651517,Its just 0.05 now
1615651527,Not really too early.
1615651553,Yeah but I literally sold when when all the doge trending stuff was going on
1615651553,im -15% in dogecoin rn
1615651555,Could have gone anywhere
1615651562,It then moved up to 0.08
1615651565,im waiting till some hype jumps up
1615651567,Huh? How?
1615651575,my dad bought at the wrong time bruh
1615651577,He probably bought the top
1615651589,Like in Jan?
1615651604,feb
1615651622,it was .06 lol
1615651626,How much do you have?
1615651636,not much thankfully only 500 usd
1615651661,I’d get rid of that once it goes back to 0.06
1615651672,"At the end of the day, its just sitting there doing nothing. You shoul def keep some of it, but seriously, you can use that money to make money."
1615651690,Yeah this is extremely true
1615651704,I'm waiting till it goes up
1615651708,Waiting on elon rn
1615651719,You'll keep waiting. Trust me. Even when it goes up
1615651730,nah im taking that shit out quick
1615651736,putting it in $ada or someshit
1615651768,0.055 should be a decent enough exit in the short term.

1615653525,really
1615653592,"You're treating these coins as if they are different directions you can take. That is not the case at all. In reality, most coins will follow BTC right now. When investing, invest in good projects, not those that you _think_ will make you a lot of dough"
1615653610,Hm so remember we were talking about BTC going to dip. Techically seen it is now doing what it was doing yesterday the entire day. After of doing that the whole day we got +4% in a single hour
1615653644,Its too late for this now. Yesterdays prediction was due to BNB
1615653646,You are scaring my alts ...
1615653658,Don’t listen to him sweet coins
1615653680,4% would be a lot :p
1615653693,that is long term investing. Imagine that you buy btc when it was 0.3 $.
1615653721,"See all coins as long term investing. Short term is a great idea, but rarely works unless you're proficient in long term"
1615653725,Then you would have sold when it was *100
1615653738,Exactly
1615653739,agree
1615653741,Who keeps an investment that long :p
1615653750,ME! ENJ!

1615653918,"The whole reason a coin price goes up,, is because a good investor buys from a bad investor"
1615653941,And it goes down when a bad investor buys from a good investor

1615658055,:kekw: @Jeremyfto on suicide watch
1615658101,Nah I have no open positions and have made my 100$ today. Trying to do 100$ profit a day by day trading. hit my mark before lunch so today is a W for me
1615658155,👍
1615658162,You go jeremy you madchad
1615658180,Loving ENJ right now.
1615658219,@Jeremyfto so when I increase leverage once I’m opened in a position how’s that work ? Like I don’t see any changes once I do it lol what happens other than obviously your leverage going up. Does it pull money from your margin ?
1615658290,@Jeremyfto Bad time to do a future?
1615658335,Going long on BTC
1615658339,125x
1615658346,Lol
1615658357,WTF Whered my money go
1615658382,I’ll go long on enj if it drops some
1615658385,"Increasing your leverage does not affect any open positions and if you ADD to an open position with increased leverage, it will not affect the initial positions leverage. The formula for leverage mixing is (base weight x base leverage)+(added weight x added leverage)/2"
1615658391,Never bought enj before
1615658405,target 1.97
1615658406,😂
1615658410,Not with crazy leverage
1615658417,Yeah that will do
1615658421,4/5x leverage
1615658431,I’ve got 1.2k available
1615658438,50x leverage!!! No clue why they even have the other options
1615658440,I did 10x leverage for ENJ last night and it took fucking forever to reach my tp of 4%
1615658454,4% x 10 = 40% profit
1615658457,I expect alts to go crazy
1615658462,but holy shit that 4% took fucking forever
1615658465,Tomorrow or Monday
1615658478,If btc don’t fall
1615658483,"@Jeremyfto You need the right timing. 
Also, BTC? SHORT?"
1615658501,I also like Dot a lot
1615658522,An example of a mixed leverage position is 100 x 10 base and 100 x 12 added = an actual leverage of 11x
1615658585,Binance will only show the last leverage mark so it will be inaccurate IF you change the leverage mid position
1615658604,Im waiting to see how high btc goes before shorting and I never long or short btc
1615658627,"The higher the value of the coin, the lower the percent of profit per movement is"
1615658628,So it increases your leverage from the price that you did it at?
1615658630,But thats the only coin that has 125x 😭😭
1615658666,"If you change your leverage, it will only affect added leverage. you cannot change the leverage for something that is already in a position"
1615658699,"if you buy 100$ 10x eth at 1200, you cannot change that to 12x down the road. you can only change what you add to it"
1615658726,So I went long on eth with 20x leverage then just changed it to 30x at this jump. But my liq price didn’t change or anything
1615658741,that is because your position didnt change. you are still at 20x
1615658743,Would be so cool if we could chamge the leverage and sell if it's tanking
1615658757,Oh boy I didn’t see ETH hit 1900
1615658762,Imagjne if we were still in haha
1615658765,🥵
1615658768,"even if you change the leverage number, it doesnt affect whats already in the position"
1615658772,Ohhhh I would have to add more in so changing it does nothing
1615658781,yes exactly
1615658786,Gotcha
1615658798,I was like what the fuck is happening nothings changed
1615658809,"if you change leverage on isolated, it will put more into your added margin btw"
1615658845,"basically since there is no way to change your base, when you up the leverage, the amount needed to keep that base is less"
1615658852,so the excess goes into your added margin
1615658861,Ahh
1615659650,"If btc fallsnow, adas going to be $0.8 again. Get ready"
1615659680,Im not jumping on the btc train but if ada goes to 0.8 ill buy the fuck out of that fire sale
1615659689,ill probably 30x it
1615659704,"Exactly. I mean I won't cause I'm 100% enj,but I would was I not"
1615659726,"Oh,this I can do."
1615659739,Anybody buying eth?
1615659742,Maybe put a buy order now itself in anticipation
1615659753,Too late now
1615659764,"If it goes to 0.8, 0.2 is a 25% gain. 25%*30 is a 7.5x profit range"
1615659765,Fuq
1615659793,Such a turn on.
1615659808,Is it likely to do that 😮
1615659816,you wanna 7.5x your money? buy the fuck out of a 0.8 ada drop and set a tp for 1$ 😂
1615659818,I keep missing the buy
1615659827,How do you know when to buy
1615659838,After a major dip
1615659841,Depends on how hard btc's balls drop
1615659841,My dog tell me to
1615659863,Ada undervalued atm
1615659868,truuuuuuuuuuuuu
1615659874,Hehe I’m gonna get on that if it does drop :p
1615659885,U gotta learn the charts bro.u can't keep missing the buy if you know where the buy is. Set a target. Stick to it
1615659909,wait wat. I got that BTC had a pump but ETH as well?!
1615659918,RSi disagrees. That's where the problem is
1615659922,imagine putting a grand into ADA and getting out with 7500 profit
1615659925,😂
1615659928,Jesus one day I am barely behind the laptop 😂

1615660054,@Jeremyfto did you get on board
1615660057,You gotta diversify if you want profits in day trading
1615660086,Where do u get these images from?
1615660093,I did but not that hard 😂 I got in at 1.04 and got out at 1.10
1615660108,I was in the bath during the big drop
1615660119,so I had to scavenge the scraps of the aftermath
1615660128,
1615660128,@SeineJanie title of his sex tape
1615660143,dont you love seeing those 4 lines all red
1615660145,What do those red exclamation marks mean?
1615660148,its my favorite for profit positions
1615660169,it means you made too much profit and binance might fuck you by lowering your position when you close it
1615660173,its really really fucked up
1615660180,but hey 🤷‍♂️
1615660186,For real...?
1615660190,yep
1615660206,I just really don’t know where ADA is going to go
1615660207,That’s fucked
1615660208,Ahh.thanks
1615660220,That low-key puts me off futures a little bit
1615660230,I hope back down for one more buy in. Kinda depends on what BTC is thinking of doing though
1615660237,Don't look at it. look at btc.
1615660248,"if BTC crashes because of this 60k mark, the market will with it"
1615660257,Yep
1615660266,All except for my little enj
1615660271,Enjel
1615660277,Christ we almost had it
1615660284,Five minutes without ENJ
1615660285,BTC is a bitch cause you make very little profits day trading it but it fucks the rest of the day trades up when it goes down 😂
1615660287,Hehe
1615660288,We were so close
1615660289,I know.
1615660317,its so big that there is very little reason to day trade btc
1615660331,No Nm
1615660336,I can look it up
1615660341,Don’t explain it again for me
1615660348,No 651.08% of their original investment
1615660353,thats profit range
1615660358,so you need to add 100% to it
1615660364,cause you keep the base
1615660366,I should try it with 10 dollar to see
1615660413,Whos in mana right now
1615660495,"Also, both enj and mana mooning rn"
1615660857,"I teach people how to earn daily from working at home and working less often than ever through the innovation of bitcoin, Send me PM to get started"
1615660916,Get the fuck out of here
1615661066,did you really closed your eth position?
1615661075,can't remember if you said anything about it
1615661119,Ya I closed it at the 3x profits mark and honestly it was the right decision. I have made more day trading then what I would have had waiting
1615661143,damn
1615661155,i lost big on it
1615661723,Moon
1615661727,whats your COTD guys? (Coin of the day)

1615661785,chad of the day👀
1615661849,can anyone help me with the swissborg bank deposit?
1615661858,"like, which direction do i have to send it to?"
1615661879,its at Swift tab?
1615662149,They give u details
1615662175,And u send it to them. When u click “buy” it will twll@u what bank details
1615662191,At least it was like that for GBP transfer
1615662211,and the
1615662225,"""Bank"" ""Bank Country"" Bank address and beneficiary address"
1615662236,is necessary to input it
1615662285,whowhohwo whoa wait nvm
1615662288,Guys can someone give me their opinion on Mana?
1615662288,just saw the fees
1615662294,😂
1615662295,I doubled my money
1615662319,There was no fee to transfer for me.
1615662320,Don’t really know if I should keep it or take out the profits
1615662330,where do you live at
1615662354,isnt this a swift transference
1615662409,@felguerr  if you could share any wisdom to me i'd appreciate ❤️
1615662421,when you are able to
1615662573,ngl I might get into ENJ at 2.05 and get out at 2.1
1615662595,3% change at 10x brings 30% actual profit
1615662605,sounds like a good idea 🤷‍♂️
1615662625,gonna wait till it drops a lil more tho
1615662630,why dont you short it till 2.05 too 😂
1615662641,That is actually big brain!
1615662653,Thanks for the idea!
1615662654,https://tenor.com/view/bogdanov-bogdanoff-igor-bogdanoff-grichka-bogdanoff-gif-12078175
1615662672,not on futures
1615662676,different market
1615662773,alright shorting till 2.05
1615662787,TP at 2.05 then buy at 2.05 TP at 2.1
1615662795,wish everything drops to the ground rn
1615662808,whats TP
1615662815,oh nvm
1615662845,anyone could help with this? about CHSB bank deposit
1615662852,from another country of the EU
1615662965,Sounds like a way to lose money
1615662990,its only a 2 cent drop from actual
1615662999,and im only 10xing it so not much risk involved
1615663023,UK.
1615663037,im more confident about it dropping 2 cents then it gaining 22 cents
1615663106,I had “local bank details” for my transfer. Not swift.
1615663133,Also u can send some BTC or eth to your Wallet and exchange feom it to CHSB
1615663186,@Jeremyfto ADA time?? Long?
1615663211,im currently shorting ENJ till 2.05; let me check ada rn
1615663243,im gonna wait on ada. 1.1 is still pretty up there
1615663253,its record high was like 1.2ish yesterday
1615663256,Ok
1615663258,Ty
1615663268,ye but fees are high
1615663273,That's how solid enjin is
1615663284,"Regarding futures, if you go sell/short does that mean you make money from it going down?"
1615663285,hope its not swift because in that case im gonna lose like 50% of the transfer 🤣
1615663293,another day another loss in this fucking week
1615663294,yes
1615663309,"Oh interesting, thank you"
1615663391,Meh. This guys back.
1615663524,All done? Howd it go?
1615663550,Still havent hit 2.05 yet
1615663552,Werent you banned from this group?
1615663559,so still waiting
1615663562,It did
1615663580,not on futures
1615663583,different market
1615663583,SO strange. There are a couple sell orders at 2.05
1615663590,Obviously
1615663598,What market are you on?
1615663600,lowest it got on futures is 2.053
1615663606,It even says you are muted
1615663612,@Kayne
1615663619,futures market binance
1615663632,Haha
1615663691,"Dude, just stop. Mods are letting you be here to learn and trade wisely. I dont think they want you to be talking. Why u trying to push them"
1615663723,😒
1615663753,Ok. so then lets talk crypto.
1615663768,This is different from what im using?
1615663803,$4 in a couple of days
1615663808,"also lad did you use this info they had below the reference, IBAN and Bank Code"
1615663813,After the weekend tho
1615663820,"the bank name, country, address, etc"
1615663828,That’s quite high isn’t it?
1615663847,Like a 100% increase or so in a few days
1615663850,Its super cheap even now
1615663857,See trend
1615663860,Valued at $2.05? 🤔
1615663869,"0.0054 alice from half day of staking, such profits,much interest"
1615663884,Ok. Then dont invest. Thats fine
1615663898,Not until end of next month
1615663903,"Im sceptical about going into ENJ right now, I feel like I’ve left it too late for there to be a huge dip"
1615663905,And that too maybe only
1615663905,if you are right i'll send you a feet pic
1615663908,But I have no clue me
1615663927,Feet pic? Is this a thing?
1615663954,😮
1615663955,Why? Lol
1615663975,Like i said I want to get in.. but with leverage and I would feel safer buying at ~1.97
1615664004,@bcdcdaz Has been 100% accurate with every single thing he's said so far. Might not want to come at him.
1615664007,"Hello guys,what should i buy?"
1615664010,can you help me
1615664036,This is the general public perception of what this will be in april
1615664042,I mean we don’t know
1615664053,It has to correct on the way up
1615664055,"Dont know. What i do know, is that im 100% in ENJ"
1615664057,That’s for sure
1615664064,No. Had sort Code and account number. For GBP transfer. That’s all
1615664135,"Because ENJ is not like any other coin in the market. There is literally nothing else with that sort of use case. Its already growing like mad shit as a product already. Partnered with Microsoft, atari, bmw, ibm...bla bla endless list."
1615664143,Btc is going
1615664147,@Jelle He's behaving for now
1615664207,"Kayne is stupid, I have given him evidence up evidence to back up my enjin theory which is why he's now blocked"
1615664209,Nope.
1615664223,I know. But lets play this out. Boy needs to learn.
1615664236,Just a quick question for my interest guys
1615664242,Lolz @ kanye
1615664252,Yup?
1615664273,How many of you would be interested in learning more about FA and how to look for a good project?
1615664285,Me for sure.
1615664298,FA is financial analysis right?
1615664332,What strengths and weaknesses are on a coin and why it can grow in the future
1615664335,Fundamentals
1615664340,Fundamental analysis
1615664342,"ok it seems bank site was bugged, might not be a penny for fees"
1615664351,wont know until i see them in my phone
1615664370,me ff sake
1615664376,Ahh. right. Still me interested.
1615664384,Lol
1615664388,i gotta finish this course of technical analysis when i get my drivers license this month
1615664393,then learn fundamentals
1615664410,new name
1615664422,@Post Grad @Mablungware would like some help please. Wants to know what to invest in.
1615664424,rough answer but hell i want it
1615664434,im do not have a job rn
1615664444,"but when i get a salary, i want to know where to put it"
1615664448,I love it now when people insert FF in the middle of normal sentences
1615664478,@Jeremyfto Are you not done yet? This thing is just hovering above 2.05 for me
1615664516,Im done now
1615664522,My TP just hit like 30 seconds ago
1615664540,Lol and now its going up. How did you do that?
1615664564,@Jeremyfto  TELL ME HOW TO CONTROL IT LIKE THAT FFS!!!
1615664567,https://tenor.com/view/bogdanov-bogdanof-bitcoin-on-the-phone-gif-12411899
1615664573,thats me
1615664577,HES THE SON OF BOGDANOFF
1615664581,🤣
1615664586,"LYM bout to pop 🚀
(not advice)"
1615664605,nah what I do is I look at the last 6 hours or so and look at their lowest lows and their highest highs
1615664612,I make my price predictions off those
1615664654,last hour candle had a low of 2.03. 2.05 was a reasonable assumption
1615664657,But last 6 hr low was 1.94
1615664661,Oh
1615664680,ya I dont use all 6 hours all together as the only prediction method
1615664697,"Oh, you're looking at the BB cycle"
1615664720,I look at the last 6 hours but Ill also value the most recent hours higher than the further away hours
1615664736,so 6 hours ago data is not worth as much as last hour's data
1615664743,its still useful
1615664747,but not AS relevant
1615664775,https://tenor.com/view/rubeus-hagrid-you-are-a-wizard-harry-potter-eyebrows-gif-12584277
1615664787,Alright im at +130$ for the day. Ill call it quits now and clean my apartment IG
1615664793,Keeping an eye on ADA tho
1615664802,thats prob going to be my next big move
1615664839,like 250-300. I dont remember the exact number
1615664848,I didnt make 130 off just that trade
1615664854,I made like 50 on that trade
1615664879,I made like 40 on a ETH long
1615664896,then I made another 40 a few hours ago on a ENJ long
1615664913,10x leverage on the ENJs. 30x on the ETH
1615664936,"@Jeremyfto Now when kanye's messages get deleted, it will just look like you''re talking to yourself and gloating"
1615664936,take profit
1615664938,only reason why I did 30x is we were getting close to 1900 and that is when people push hard
1615664945,Take profit
1615664953,See? Hahahaha
1615664955,
1615664978,Eh there is a message deleted on the reply so its obv Im talking to someone lol
1615664990,but regardless I talk to myself a lot anyways 🤷‍♂️
1615665010,Heh. Just thought thatd be funny
1615665023,Son of a bitch! I sold my doge for ENJ!
1615665023,lol did anyone participate in that pump on bcr
1615665026,such a scam
1615665036,"NO
FUCKING
WAY"
1615665046,Pumps are not a scam
1615665059,🥺
1615665060,"11 ""trusted"" collab lmao , pre pump at 5 am 6 am 9 am , their admin even said ""Facts"" on needing a bot to profit, then deleted it"
1615665072,I havent had any fail positions today
1615665075,thats pretty pog tbh
1615665088,"Let me ask you this. If you knew the coin 30 mins before, would you put in money before the pump?"
1615665105,250 or so
1615665125,"anything to get an advantage obviously - but its pretty funny when the ""pump"" ends up being an immediate -10% drop"
1615665126,doesnt it depend on the leverage
1615665129,The margin you keep aside sets your liquidation price. so its upto you
1615665153,You pay the funding fee at the top every 8 hours. Every single coin has a different funding fee. The funding fee is based off your base amount of USDT not your leveraged
1615665173,most of the time the funding fee is around 0.05-0.1% every 8 hours
1615665176,Dont participate in pumps. They are the biggest fallacy in the crypto world. Do it right
1615665191,so you pay 0.15-0.3% daily
1615665207,0.05% of your held USD or borrowed USD?
1615665225,its not a dialy fee
1615665238,Not yet. Wait
1615665239,"its a ""fee"" to cover those who get so rekt that fall even below their liq price"
1615665241,i think
1615665250,That is correct. you will pay that 8 hour fee and then the sell fee at the end
1615665260,yeah i know but its not technically a daily fee or am i confused jeremy
1615665277,Arregh! Fuck BTC
1615665282,0.02 market price 0.04 limit price i think
1615665284,%
1615665288,im about to do a future 50x on ENJ
1615665293,"fuck it, is only $200"
1615665320,if i only have to pay a fee of 0.1 per day is ok
1615665326,you aren't confused.
1615665338,the fee from the winners goes to the losers
1615665358,"so like when ADA was tanking, long holders received the fee as compensation"
1615665366,and short holders paid the fee
1615665400,"you can tell who is paying and who is receiving based on the fee percentage. if its in the negative, shorts are paying. if its in the positive, longs are paying"
1615665445,"If it goes up then you will more than likely pay the fee as longs will be winning and the fee will go to the shorts. if you are getting paid the fee, you are probably losing money"
1615665471,basically the fee comes from the winners and goes to the losers
1615665482,so whichever side is winning is paying the fee
1615665490,whichever side is losing is receiving the fee
1615665509,THere is absolutely no explanation as to why this fee exist but 🤷‍♂️
1615665523,its just 0.15-0.3% per day
1615665532,Where we looking to enter ENJ now
1615665569,Im out rn. I shorted it to 2.05 and then got out. Prob gonna be done with ENJ for the day tbh
1615665651,"If it were me, id enter around 2 somewhere. It might fall past that, but thats ok"
1615665700,2 at 10x will leave you with a 1.8 liq which honestly is pretty safe as long as it doesnt plunge to the depths of hell
1615665707,enj its good to buy and hold ?
1615665726,
1615665733,Absolutely
1615665735,isolated man
1615665737,never cross
1615665742,you can control your risk better
1615665744,Uhhhh.
1615665746,Sure?
1615665750,know the differences?
1615665761,"if you are taking only position at a time doesnt even matter, no effects"
1615665767,Sort of. Isolated si where i add margin?
1615665777,"i bought MBL today, and trade my ej to buy it.  i made a bad choise ? XD"
1615665789,"cross funds are shared on all your position, if one fucks it up really much, you get fuck globally"
1615665794,isolated you decide it
1615665801,I only have 1 position at any time tho
1615665816,Globally even with my spot money?
1615665842,@Jeremyfto Please help
1615665855,cross funds
1615665856,not spot
1615665861,Ah. Thank god
1615665867,Kanye at it again
1615665867,🤣
1615665884,Ok. So far then iv been safe doing only one position at a time.
1615665901,"In isolated, how do i add margin to a position then"
1615665905,cross doesnt affect your spot. I do recommend isolated but it wont affect your spot funds
1615665917,There is a + next to the margin number on isolated
1615665920,Cross wont either right?
1615665933,whats he doing now lol
1615665934,I meant cross
1615665935,lol
1615665939,Lol. Ok
1615665941,Thanks
1615665952,https://tenor.com/view/harrypotter-hagrid-lizard-yer-a-lizard-harry-funny-gif-6194787
1615665954,Being this
1615665964,"if you cross on only 1 position, its the same as doing isolated"
1615665965,i think
1615665975,Its ok. Might as well do it right.
1615665977,the funds are only for a single coin
1615665981,talking then
1615665982,pair**
1615665985,It affects your entire futures wallet
1615665986,would be the best word
1615665986,Im in isolated now. Hope im not i so late
1615665994,and all other cross positions
1615666016,"so like what Blackhartd said, if one cross position fails, they all fail"
1615666023,I think this is why Kanye is muted. He knows jack shit
1615666031,Thats ok. Hes learning
1615666043,I almost died. Nothing must ever touch my ENJel
1615666057,"As long as everyone isnt trolling, im cool with teaching everyone futures"
1615666060,futures are very confusing
1615666083,Once you figure them out they can make you a lot more money than spot but they are hella confusing at first
1615666091,Dammit. ADA flew up suddenly
1615666113,Yeah. I've stopped day trading thanks to them. But they might get taken out soon
1615666152,Theres a difference between being clueless and learning and being clueless and giving advice.
1615666195,Lets just all settle down. Its chill; Heres my opinion on use cases for cross as cross is useful too at times!
1615666204,cross is really great for high leverage positions
1615666223,doing 125x? using cross works great because sometimes you dont have time to add to your margin
1615666231,"Dude. ADA is pissing me off sooooo much right now. Like seriosuly, was it waiting for me to be ready to get in there?"
1615666247,Im waiting till its inevitable drop again
1615666255,"Oh, so this way i keep my entire futures wallet 100% safe. I like this"
1615666279,"Then i can add money in. I've been adding only $50 a pop and doing one trade, then adding more if i lose it"
1615666318,Gotta say though. This BTC thing seems to inorganic that i dont think it will drop now. Not enough anyway
1615666318,"you gotta remember, the things that happen in the crypto world aren't anomalies. You cant FOMO because there is always another event with another coin"
1615666352,Agreed. Except wth ENJ. That will never happen again
1615666358,I think there will be a decent drop. There are only so many whales
1615666373,61K now. FML
1615666383,No. ENJ is no exception. It may not happen for ENJ ever again BUT it will happen with another coin
1615666401,"The thing is, every single thing that happens to one coin, has happened to many many many other coins"
1615666407,coins crash. Coins explode
1615666434,"ENJ for me is BTC. As fas as i am concerned, we're at the birth of the new leading currency."
1615666453,I personally try to stay deattached from all coins
1615666459,hell I shorted ETH the other day
1615666474,Its how I have become more and more profitable
1615666489,Im detached. I short it as well. I even sell 100% of it to buy back at a lower cost. Im in the business that ENJ is targeting. Hence my opinion  being so strong
1615666515,"the less I give a shit about one coin, the better my profits. Crypto is all about good research and not giving a shit 😂"
1615666528,truee

1615666794,ENJ?
1615666810,Dont think you'll reach that
1615666816,Actually untrue. He would have gotten fucked by saron if he didnt get fucked by the hobits

1615667299,Lol I'm confused. Why us he doing that
1615667299,@Romeeeo it only has been above 61k fr for 30 minutes
1615667340,It's still in an upward channel but could drop as low as 1.90 or even lower before going up again. *That* would be a good point of entry.
1615667341,U should have seen it coming
1615667348,i mean did u think 60k was stabilized
1615667355,"No, i am shorting"
1615667367,Cause he's been castrated by the mods
1615667377,Although on the 1h ENJ looks like it could be flatlining...
1615667383,Ooof
1615667401,shorting during a bull run
1615667402,gl my g

1615667522,Guys what's your opinion on CRO?
1615667535,I've just staked it for 180 days accidentally 😂
1615667536,Experts
1615667539,I need help
1615667542,100% go for it for me. And also stake it.
1615667569,Meh
1615667574,Crypthanos!
1615667575,I really do need to figure it out why Altcoins dropping while BTC trying ATH or BTC dipping ? Shouldnt be up down ? I mean if btc goes high alts should follow ? And if btc dips alt dips ?
1615667580,Please give me an explanation here
1615667583,I need this info
1615667583,Already done! I guess I'll just hold for a year. And take the profits.
1615667613,"`BTCUP: New peak at 211.986 $! Gained 22.31% from entry @ 173.325 $`
Oh yeah baby!!!"
1615667635,Wait foro a super charger event and put it in then for staking. @bcdcdaz can give you more info on that
1615667638,CRO = big expectation good to have a bag of it but imo i will not stake them.
1615667654,Oh what's that!
1615667658,Im up 14% only from staking tho
1615667665,What you guys think is the next btc move ?
1615667667,"Alts perform best when btc is going sideways because ppl are looking for better profits. If the mother of all coins pumps, ppl are selling alts to get on BTC train"
1615667682,Sure it would great @bcdcdaz
1615667692,Up? 😁
1615667711,"Bro 
- not all the alt are dip
- this is the usual cycle
BTC is pumping, trying new ath playing, then dip—- consolidation and at this time the money will move to alt"
1615667737,@SeineJanie I sold my stuff at the 58k peak but I might just wait the next dip but I’m also scared it will never go back below that 😂
1615667750,It has to . Consolidation
1615667757,I thought about doing that as well. Then I didn't. 😂
1615667784,"Could go back down to 58k from here, sure. Maybe. Not unreasonable"
1615667786,I will go safe and just wait few days
1615667814,"cro go full defi cold storage on 25th march with 20% staking, when they launch on mainnet"
1615667847,So everytime it tries ATH i should look for dip on alts ?
1615667854,Ty now i know more
1615667867,Right now I've staked all the CRO I had on the exchange platform 😔 I didn't even know how i managed to do that.
1615667875,"Not only ATH, I think every time there's a bull run on BTC. Even from lower"
1615667892,I'm fairly new to using that so I ended up doing it wrong. @bcdcdaz
1615667914,on the 25th you will get 20% automatically
1615667948,I see this is info i cant get it on web ty all
1615667989,ENJ long
1615667994,Since aaaaa whileeeeee
1615668018,"Dont care if it down, believe it will continue grow"
1615668077,"Lol
Such a question.
Same as usual. Do you believe on what it could bring in real world ?"
1615668086,If yes keep and forget
1615668099,Otherwise sell cuz buying at ath its not good idea
1615668111,Wait to get your initial back
1615668115,And leave
1615668140,"It's all over Crypto Twitter, though. Example:

1615668595,"VET is being added to Coinbase, I wonder whether that’s going to noticeable change the price for VET 🤔"
1615668649,Oh alright. Even if I staked it on the exchange now?
1615668653,When?
1615668661,Matic and skl blew when coinbase listed them
1615668679,Imo it's going to rise pretty fast.
1615668701,When ETH rises its going to take all the altcoins with it.
1615668713,I believe in the next coming weeks.
1615668716,Where did u get the news that vet is going to coinbase?
1615668717,"My long term portfolio has ADA, VET, HOT and HBAR"
1615668808,Yeah it says it will switch over
1615668824,Oh then its alright! Thanks
1615668827,When is VET being listed?
1615668849,"@felguerr Sorry to bother again, but what are ur thoughts on ENJ specifically?"

1615669111,Me or Enj white knight dude
1615669213,Yeah well I don't know but the referral didn't work.
1615669235,I just transferred eth directly and it took it as STC tokens. No space for referrals.
1615669252,What?
1615669271,Vincent is stealing my refs
1615669277,Police police!
1615669278,Lol
1615669281,Time to buy eth
1615669283,No I used your ref
1615669288,But it didn't work.
1615669289,Really?
1615669303,You sent it first right? @Cryptoknight
1615669303,The ref works at signup
1615669308,Ohhh
1615669309,Yeah
1615669316,Well then I had already signed up wayu before.
1615669323,I just hadn't invested yet.
1615669342,I was looking where the referrals were😅
1615669348,Ahh. Ok
1615669350,Thats fine.

1615669697,You in for long investment or short term gains/day trading?
1615669742,Welcome
1615669816,Bitcoin is a great start for everyone that is new in crypto.
1615669853,From here you can get more knowledge and start trading on other coins
1615669883,There is already a lot in the #🔤crypto-101 and #📈trading-101 channels
1615669981,You can always ask questions in this chat
1615670092,yes.. faster way is just to lose money fast.. or fall for a scam and also lose money fast.:)
1615670113,other option is youtube tutorials 🙂 for those who cant read long pages.
1615670168,@Natallie are you willing to monitor the money you invested for on the daily? Or do you just want to invest and look at it in like 1 year?
1615670220,"Sure, so quick profits?"
1615670252,You should talk with Jeremy then
1615670305,Then i would seriously recommend reading up on it a bit
1615670367,If you don’t know anything about crypto and just go into daytrading. You are more likely to get profit at the casino
1615670486,"And if you dont like reading, there are indeed videos where it gets explained. Might be a bit more your thing"
1615670530,Well you could also go for keeping a coin longer
1615670531,Are you sure that is a good idea? 😛
1615670546,Quick money?
1615670562,- I am joking please don't hate me Jeremy u champ -
1615670571,Riskfull quick money
1615670581,"You can still watch it everyday, but your profits will take a bit longer"
1615670585,Where the hell did 90% fio come from
1615670591,Less risky
1615670591,Don’t think that Day trading with 500 dollar will end well tbh
1615670604,If you are new
1615670640,"I actually seen a video this morning ""Can I turn 1k into 5k within 10 days in day trading?""

He actually got 4k and then lost 3950"
1615670660,Thats just harsh
1615670662,he lost it within the last 2 days because he was inexperienced and cocky
1615670670,learnt day trading within a week
1615670676,I've turned 3500 into 5600 in the last 30 days
1615670699,Well  one of the biggest mistake is trading with emotion
1615670718,"You can definitely make a lot of money, but paper handing and selling at a loss and seeing it surge past your buy in the next day is really hard not to do."
1615670722,Im pretty sure you would have made more money by just holding BTC
1615670727,Jelle Jeremy made a very good anacdote about trading with emotion
1615670755,You can check that you know right?
1615670763,What anacdote?😅🤣
1615670771,Definitely made more than I would have with BTC lol
1615670772,My Binance shows the btc value Atleast :p
1615670799,"I did after writing lmao, he would have made a little less actually, mb ^^"
1615670825,Cumulative PNL is 62.1% Cumulative BTC trend is 27.62%
1615670845,Though I did lose $500 my first pump and dump
1615670850,Today was a fight against the btc value :’)
1615670852,"So, there's that."
1615670867,Oh i got my math wrong then lmao x) congrats to you :)
1615670871,"Pretty much, fortunately BTC rising faster than my alts dropping relative to it."
1615670896,So up over all even though my alts are worth less relative to BTC. Less satoshi more USD.
1615670910,im all red  😦
1615670916,today id love to be color blind lol
1615670925,no more green at least for now
1615670926,"Measure your wealth in BTC, not USD. Then you will really find riches."
1615670938,Best crypto advice i can give any beginner is to stay away from anything with pump and dump in it!

1615675198,I got in after crypto mommy
1615675200,The post grad didnt exist at this time
1615675206,"I entered ENJ because of Dazz, also CRO because of dazz. I think you guys should stop fighting on who found it. Its ok for multiple people to have found it. Fact is, Dazz sold it to me."
1615675209,Bitcoin is squeezed into the corner of a triangle. Where will we go from here? I think it should continue the trend upwards...
1615675209,The podium
1615675232,Nice
1615675235,Hahahaha broo i was just about to send this 😂
1615675251,I sold it to the world
1615675254,😘
1615675260,Triangles scare me. They are like grenades to futures. It could break out and keep going up or it could skyrocket down
1615675261,DM it.
1615675271,"hey guys, especially the more experienced day traders, im starting a trading run from 1.5 dollars on binance futures, how would you approach trading with an ultra small account?"

1615675278,🤣
1615675285,i wonder how far i can go with this
1615675308,ENJ is now at 1080 messages
1615675327,my guess is ill have to scalp on high leverage for the first 10-15 dollars and then i can switch to a more conservative strategy
1615675327,@bcdcdaz again as i said i like the way you did some work in enj but what are you expecting now ? A rank ?

1615675730,Well i don’t exactly know what you mean by that. I just get really frustrated of people taking other peoples credit
1615675744,Last couple of weeks this chat was enj only
1615675755,I made excellent money thanks to @SeineJanie on futures
1615675806,So now we have to work to find next potential to share
1615675810,And early !!!!!
1615675813,Nobody is jumping on the FET hype I know

1615675824,me @kittiewitty
1615675830,Im the biggest supporter here of it
1615675834,"Swiss, would you agree with my thinking that DENT is going to have a dip soon and I should buy then instead of where it’s at now? Hope that’s not too forward of a question, just wondering 😄"
1615675836,Only the 2 off us
1615675856,I think dent could go more
1615675867,The question is when the dip
1615675875,Cuz if btc range
1615675881,"I really think LUKSO could be the thing. I know you think we're late for not being super super early, but mainnet is planned to start in Q2. That's when LYXe will become LYX. And then moon!"
1615675883,Big big big alt pump is next story

1615676077,it's slow but it seems to go up
1615676102,Hold on a sec! Where did Jelle ever take anyone else's credit??
1615676107,I expect big bull run within 6 next week
1615676137,Then game will be over for some time
1615676141,This is my strategy
1615676148,@Jelle as nothing to prove he has an excellent atitude
1615676148,"The bull run has already started, don't you think?"
1615676153,"He didnt. He took credit away from someone else. 

Also, i will do another 3 replies to stuff, then im out. Im frankly sick of explaining the basics of human etiquette everyday."
1615676156,Not for alts
1615676163,I have 😉
1615676174,alt run is over bros. sell me your bag now

1615676225,Sweet!!
1615676241,I really reallly think my english understanding are so bad. I though the issue of ENJ story was close with you and @bcdcdaz  but i still cant catch whats the pb
1615676264,me neither and I am fluent in English
1615676281,"Explain to me how this makes sense. Explain what the association here was. Explain where the good attitude is. Please. Super curious. 

I do not know Dazz in real life. I hardly know him. But it pissed me the fuck off when people do this shit. Only reason im in this conversation."
1615676293,Well i dont care what people think of me. I just think that constantly telling people about the same coin is irritating. And by the reaction of others im not the only one
1615676314,"Dude, literally at the beginning of Feb Swiss was mentioning ENJ!"
1615676318,"I'm not shilling, I did a special on them as they are bigger than a lot of ppl realise"
1615676318,Just check the facts my friend
1615676333,Bigger of what
1615676334,"And CryptoDomme has been making consistent calls on ENJ, also with tp and down waves"
1615676336,Fuck that
1615676338,HOW does that matter??? Dont you guys overlap with calls?
1615676350,All before our friend @bcdcdaz even appeared here
1615676350,I am gonna start talk in french
1615676356,C quoi le pb
1615676356,Who the hell is taking credit away from you
1615676365,Tu nous petes les couilles avec ton putin de call enjin
1615676372,Yen a plein des bigger
1615676374,Same discussion like earlier today
1615676378,2 weeks profit from ENJ is +200% though and nobody can say dazzz wasn't trying to get everyone to see the upcoming growth.
1615676381,XRP en fait partie

1615676532,Oh
1615676537,We where off topic
1615676562,"Rule 6 does say:
```
6. Don't tell people to buy into coins or any type of investment.  A lot of new members come here looking for advice, telling them to buy into your bags is a big no-no.
```
We have vetted @Post Grad's to make the call for you. So the discussion here is pointless. I asked for someone who made money from a call explicitly from #🎓post-grads-podium, nothing else."
1615676580,"So @bcdcdaz is telling he sold enj to the world, while swiss talked about it way before him. I think thats not cool and thats why i ridicule it"

1615676781,"Man, Discord is laaaaaggy for me"

1615677076,Hoping no gas on $anal
1615677088,Hey its the cost for a good product
1615677094,STMX been strong last day or so
1615677102,This is going to keep happening tbh. Nothing has changed. Just deffered to later.
1615677103,everything has been strong in the last day
1615677116,OY TAKE THAT TO #🍆frat-chat
1615677119,"Not by me, by the next hguy"
1615677133,Sorry (._. )
1615677135,for sure! Im actually reaching my day trading goals
1615677138,this was a special scenario because 2 people called ENJ lol.
1615677140,🙏
1615677151,@David R. Update. Still in
1615677160,We'll it wasnt. Pretty much atleast 2 post grads have the same call.
1615677163,thats what we like to see
1615677165,"last month $shit value was 0,00000000US$ and now it is 0,00000002US$
that is a ∞ profit"
1615677172,You legend! I am gobsmacked 😂
1615677173,mfw he's still continuing it
1615677174,what's wrong with that?
1615677181,Exactly. Whats wrong with that
1615677187,🤔
1615677201,Wow! My shit wasn't worth that much
1615677220,Might i refer back to this @Alanox
1615677228,dont bother @Alanox the guys an idiot
1615677238,I still don't see how this was an issue
1615677244,By the way did you guys hear about $ENJ ? It seems good to hold with kids buying fortnite skins. @Alanox can i be post grad now?
1615677250,both of those grads did call ENJ
1615677267,"Jelle suggested that there was something wrong with Dazz also having the same call when they also had the call. So same question, whats wrong with that"
1615677270,bro for gods sake go to #🍆frat-chat lmfao
1615677285,"again, draw the line between shill & call"
1615677302,"No, that's not what he did. It was wrong to ask for credit as ENJ being *his* call."
1615677312,this too.
1615677319,which is ok
1615677322,He's forgiven
1615677327,so no need to keep discussing it
1615677340,"I am deeply grateful for that shill. So are a lot of other people here. Also, it wasnt a shill, it was a barrage of info about ENJ. Something no one here has ever done. He never said BUY it. He said. LOOK!"
1615677362,cool but I see it every time I open this chat?
1615677367,It has been ENJ content for the past week
1615677379,Oh you beat me to it
1615677386,Where should I put a stop loss if I would enter btc for the night?
1615677393,Below 60.5?
1615677398,10+ days
1615677403,"You see it because of everyone else! We get into such stupid childish arguements about it. My call, no my call. And ironically, Dazz is not a part of these arguements. He's off researching!"
1615677418,"Ok still the other topic, I see"
1615677425,Help me
1615677427,https://tenor.com/view/no-sleep-its-been84years-titanic-gif-13077787
1615677444,Thanks. Im slightly cool now
1615677444,"good, let him post links etc. no one argued against that, but people are tired of seeing the 3 letters: ENJ. People just asking for variation, amigo."
1615677449,You should help yourself by not caring
1615677450,DEGO pls
1615677465,my dego went up since the argument started
1615677471,Argue more pls
1615677474,gotta fatten this bag rq
1615677482,🥳
1615677483,I’m crying 😂😂
1615677488,Or should I stay in stable coin
1615677496,Or just skip sleeping
1615677499,Been dry for days mate
1615677501,nah bro
1615677504,ENJ
1615677511,chz bro
1615677513,"no need for facts, buy ENJ"
1615677514,not too late for another 100%
1615677519,Get into the CHZ
1615677522,Stahpppp
1615677531,Not while I am asleep 😦
1615677543,Stablecoins? Like you're holding USDT? 😂
1615677544,"Lol. But ENJ comes into the picture in bulk only when people start getting sensitive about it, or trolling."
1615677546,@David R. Took profit at +100% and moved stop loss higher
1615677575,its because it's all you talk about
1615677577,2% a day and then back to usdt :p
1615677584,"we talk about different stuff, and you come in here shilling enj and dazz"
1615677592,Congratulations man!
1615677595,we already know about ENJ and now we're off to our own research. No need to keep feeding people about it cause then no one will learn?
1615677599,I just need 200 days :’)
1615677599,Thanks for your initial ENJ call
1615677600,"Anyway, im done. This was only my worry for this group. Im done"
1615677606,but now we don't need any more of it
1615677616,It's in the back of our head now
1615677630,Front and middle also
1615677647,This is like a discussion with my gf who is so stubborn that it escalates about some non relevant issue
1615677649,Not true. I've never believed in any coin so far. Wouldnt have beleived in ENJ either if i wasnt given all the info right there.
1615677660,If you keep feeding people something it becomes shilling and it also doesn't make anyone learn anything
1615677663,Someone on FURUCOMBO?
1615677669,I guess she'd say the same about you 😄 That you're stubborn 😛
1615677670,"I think it’s going to make people feel awkward when raising a discussion about ENJ in the future, especially if something like this happens again uno, at least I would"
1615677676,So school is a big shill i suppose
1615677677,I love ENJ dude but I'm tired of seeing it now
1615677684,b r u h
1615677685,Those fucking text books. Full of shill
1615677689,man...
1615677694,now ur petty
1615677698,WTF 💀💀 what is this?!?!?
1615677698,Ok. Now im being childish
1615677699,Yes
1615677703,do you remember the answers from your 6th grade biology test? Don't think so
1615677707,Most people study to forget
1615677712,It's a yolo future. It's what I do at night.
1615677713,I did in 7th grade
1615677713,unless they research themselves
1615677723,"So yes, school is shill lol. I don't agree with the scholar system at all"
1615677735,It's very flawed
1615677758,Not the only system thats flawed my friend.
1615677759,uni's are useless unless youre in STEM
1615677764,"@Alanox This is crypto only, would you please return to a crypto-related discussion? 😛"
1615677770,Otherwise I'd have to call the mods on you
1615677770,"If you don't learn something yourself, then you are not learning it FOR yourself"
1615677771,.Yeah. Im out anyway
1615677772,GO BACK UP DEGO 🥶
1615677774,This 😂😂🤣
1615677778,fuck im scared
1615677787,Whatever makes you sleep better at night 🤣 I’d sleep very well if I had a trade like that lol
1615677830,ONG
1615677840,Imagine doing trades like these at night
1615677849,Id sleep in a puddle of tears
1615677856,Portfolio liquidated
1615677870,Hahaha I couldn’t handle it
1615677979,Frrr
1615678196,"Nah, I close all positions before I close my eyes 😄"
1615678199,or set a stop loss
1615678219,I don't put my whole pf into futures wallet tho 😄
1615678220,You risky bugger 🤣
1615678253,I feel that
1615678326,"I haven’t managed to predict a good futures yet, I’m really crap at it, tried it for THETA and it went down, I’m worried about going in and I’m just sat -% the whole time :c"
1615678415,"I donno, I seem to have a knack for Bitcoin. Can't do it well on other coins either."
1615678426,Maybe it's because we've known each other for almost 10 years now 😄
1615678504,"You 2 have a good relationship, see I haven’t built that with anything yet 😅"
1615678583,:kekw: today was a crypto break day
1615678585,For me
1615678611,It was more an on-off-thing for the first couple of years tbh
1615678654,:kekw: btc fucking die. I am gonna lose my short on the swissborg community app
1615678712,You FOMO'd me into creating my futures account. Im gonna do a 49cent one to begin with 😂
1615678742,I am gon a do a 500 bucks x10 ada long. Yolo and stuff
1615678930,Be ready to lose all 500 bucks
1615678954,:chad: i have faith
1615678958,"I did bad on my first couple of futures. First I did great, then I did another pos and another pos and couldn't stop and lost all I had gained, and more 😄"
1615678997,Do future. Btc crashes 20% get liquidated :kekw:
1615679261,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zt6yrg-UJw&feature=youtu.be
1615679489,What's up guys?
1615679499,BTC is
1615679510,😂
1615679535,"You know the saying, what goes up comes down"
1615679554,"But yeah, BTC is a fucking beast"
1615679621,"It's quite funny watching the alt coins scared as shit. As soon as BTC dumps a little, they all dump too."
1615679656,It has to be bots right? Like no way every single alt just crashes at the exact same moment essentially
1615679661,Buy when BTC pumps. They just watch the rocket on the side line.
1615679682,"I don't know, might be."
1615679710,Bots programmed with the knowledge of altseasons past
1615679738,Considering how much BTC has gone up this year. In comparison the ALTs have not gained much. It's crazy
1615679765,Man some alts are up thousands of percent
1615679792,"Yes that's true, but only some"
1615679797,Also might have alot more fiat to play with. Going to be fun
1615679835,Essentially hawk post grad posts and use swissborg as storage
1615679886,I'm considering in participating in the XSL ICO
1615679897,It's open again if anyone would like to register
1615679915,OH SHIT. Need to double my bag before it sells out
1615679941,"What a wonderful saturday night guys, ENJoy it!!"
1615680026,
1615680064,"https://decryptionary.com/dictionary/shilling/

For the people that still don’t fully understand what shilling means, read the full page please!"
1615680084,How long do you guys think CHZ will be correcting?
1615680090,when is the futures tips gonna be open?
1615680094,HBAR mini pump at the moment
1615680098,For 50 days
1615680098,We are so LUKSOy to be alive in a time like this
1615680114,"Here is a referral link if anyone is interested in XSL.

https://www.xsl-labs.io/syl?access=24908"
1615680118,Soon 👀
1615680124,Oh wow... unexpected drop on BTC
1615680130,"oh well, my stop loss hit, good night!"
1615680135,Or you use swiss's you know. The og
1615680158,Yes thank.
1615680178,Bro LUKSO is such an ENJineering miracle
1615680217,@David R. Another 32 bucks of profit for a total of 122 or 61%.
1615680236,Looks like it’s going up again
1615680247,"Nice one man, easy gains. That dip sucks ass though 😦"
1615680265,"Yeah, now it's going crazy for three minutes"
1615680270,Time to hit the sack! See ya
1615680285,"Night buddy, take care"
1615680297,U2
1615680308,wouldn't say that too soon
1615680344,Was roughly this time each day that it pump
1615680369,Needs to climb a lot to break that downtrend
1615680400,I mean from a trading perspective by the way. Can make a few dollars easily from this
1615680412,"Is it better to have a conservative bot with a liberal amount of money, or an aggressive bot with a conservative amount of money"
1615680417,I believe it's because of the daily candle closing
1615680426,some other altcoins pumped too just now
1615680579,:virgin: fucking binance let me unstake 1 bnb for a swap to ltc for SYL yah cunts
1615680603,i bought last CHZ bag at 7.5
1615680605,SLP/ETH BUY THE BOUNCE
1615681027,how
1615681035,what indications are there?
1615681353,Trust me bro. Its stupid hard to read. I dont know how to read charts. Look up some good youtube vids on the subject. Education is very important if you want to day trade
1615681482,"every time I see ENJ at a rounded 2.00, I get excited"
1615681499,then I zoom out and get reminded that it broke under just earlier today
1615681503,I want to enter so badly
1615681522,but I swear it's so hard to predict what happens with the whole btc explosion
1615681709,"just saw this, sorry. yeah I ended up doing it even tho it never went under 90, but hey, I've got more money in my binance to lose yay"
1615681756,ESPECIALLY since it's trying a new ATH again right now
1615682764,DEGO ! Rocket !
1615683458,I entered at 2 today. Getting out at 2.1
1615683483,I did too
1615683487,when I posted that msg lol
1615683502,I set it up like 8 hours ago lol
1615683510,oh damn
1615683513,Its been sleepin
1615683531,I was just like “eh i got nothing going. Ill wait”
1615683539,precisely
1615683587,2->2.1 is like 4%. Thats 40% PNL when its 10xed
1615683606,Its actually closer to 5%
1615683610,Its 4.8%
1615683621,that's gonna be a good bag
1615683632,"I'm 8x, looking towards 2.1 too"
1615683647,Just threw 400$ at it but im not gonna turn down 180$
1615683666,Its super low risk IMO
1615683843,I think so too
1615683849,but it also depends on your liq price
1615683864,shouldn't be too far from mine since you're 2x more leverage than me
1615683992,Its 1.81
1615684001,Which it hasnt hit in 3 days
1615684031,yeah that's a good one
1615684036,Its hit high 2.1s and low 2.2s in the last day and a half
1615684038,1.79 here
1615684060,So IMO its more likely to hit my 2.1 then liquidate
1615684070,But we’ll see!
1615684076,"Hey guys, quick question what exchanges do you guys recommend for buying the smaller altcoins, like kardiachain, NEM, and other shitcoin/altcoin. Having the hardest time trying to find a one stop shop..."
1615684430,For small alts there wont be a one stop shop because all exchanges have different prices. Some alt devs can spend like half a bitcoin on listing. Some can barely spend 0.1. Gonna need alot of exchanges
1615684579,@Jeremyfto thoughts on ada right now?
1615684582,1.07
1615684622,I normally would wait till 1.05 but im at the movies rn
1615684639,hahahah enjoy the movie 🙂
1615684647,we'll see if it's still there by the time you're back
1615684656,I think it’ll go down under 1.05 again. Maybe not too far under
1615684672,Honestly i want to long ada x10 but man btc pumping is scary
1615684674,"When it got to under $1, people bought in bulk"
1615684682,it really is...
1615684684,And it only saw it for a short time
1615684685,If btc crashes it might crash ada back
1615684701,this is what I'm thinking too... 1.07 is not far off from the good support
1615684733,0.98 is the ultimate bottom
1615684753,hmmm I'll keep an eye on it for a bit longer and then decide
1615684760,I don’t think it gets there again personally
1615684767,me neither yeah
1615684776,Like I think 1.02 is a chance
1615684784,But might not be for long
1615684839,Tbh we also said ada was never gonna break 1 buck
1615684847,"tbh I'm a little confused as to why so many altcoins are at their lowest bottoms again... ENJ had a massive surge earlier today, but it's back to 2.0 flat. btc hasn't done anything too crazy since the initial 60k?"
1615684850,what am I missing here
1615684856,is it the new ath hype?
1615684861,people getting in and out?
1615684863,Yed
1615684864,Yes
1615684873,okay that explains it then
1615684875,thanks
1615684978,"But its weird. Back in 2017/2018 when btc pumped alts bled hard. Now it tends to pump alts up with it. Back in the days btc dumps would make alts go up because people selling btc for profit and putting it back into alts.

Its all wrong now. But that might be the ""alt season"" thing not being in full swing. I dont know"
1615684993,You’d assume the money gained from different alts is being thrown around
1615685006,interesting
1615685388,STMX 😍
1615685487,People who bull on btc to one million dont understand how much fucking alts would be worth.
1615685516,One satoshi would be one cent

1615693661,if you mention it again or ask for people to send you btc again I will err on the side of caution and mute/ban you becuase that isn't allowed here.
1615693703,no worries
1615693706,I apologize for misreading the username. I would have warned them too if I saw that message. I thought you were talking about kenneths message above it
1615693738,so i guess the .29 BTC i have on there isnt real ?
1615693766,its not real no
1615693774,its a common scam
1615693865,"shrug.  friend tells me to sign up, give him my account info.  i sign in to have .29 btc   i guess i'll go talk to him"
1615693867,later
1615694332,@Sausage Destroyer Does look okay? (legit) found some stuff on google about them
1615694340,https://globalcrypto.exchange/i/R0NYMTYxNTY5MDkxOA==
1615694366,
1615694387,found it on coin codex ico list
1615694436,what is this in relation to? idk why im tagged
1615694476,I was asking for your opinion on the ico sale I found
1615694516,"Regardless of if its relevant, its giving 1000 free coins per email sign up. even if they are worth a cent, Ill take my free 10$ 😂"
1615694533,oh I didn't even see the original tag. I'm not the FA expert around here - swiss and some of the other european dudes here are better at assessing ICO's than me
1615694549,I'm very cautious and won't put money in but will take free coins all day lol
1615694599,Oh same. they arent getting a cent out of me
1615694600,yeah but what do you have to do to get those free coins? for example there was a $50 promo a while ago on crypto dot com as a sign up bonus but only if you staked something stupid for 3 months - IMO not worth it.
1615694618,This one says just sign your email up to their newsletter
1615694623,🤷‍♂️
1615694629,if its that easy Ill take it
1615694642,"if its not that easy, then im trashin it"
1615694649,"no such thing as free lunch, I would be looking at the fine print to find the hook"
1615694655,"you get them regardless, but can stake for 12 months at 0.01% might as well"
1615694661,No free lunch 😞
1615694668,If it fails I lose nothing
1615694701,Yeah cheers jeremy
1615694716,"on a side note, I signed my email up but it still hasnt gotten here so we shall see"
1615694727,ill prob just check back tomorrow

1615701384,"Why is ADA not linked to BTC? I.e. when BTC goes up, ADA stays where it is $ value wise"
1615701470,Because Ada is an independent woman 💪🏻
1615701486,Plus that red with the logo colours totally don't go together
1615701633,Maybe this article offers some insight: https://coinmarketcap.com/de/headlines/news/ada-usd-correlation-with-btc-usd-dips-to-negative-an-extremely-rare-occurance/
1615702362,"oof yeah, these tiny btc dips are causing much bigger drops on majority of altcoins atm"
1615705098,"oh, it is perfectly linked last days: when BTC goes up, ADA goes down, and when BTC goes down ADA goes down 😄"

1615707075,@kittiewitty see you on the moon friend
1615707096,I wish I wasn’t trading lol
1615707101,Why
1615707107,My friend has 100k already now
1615707112,Its crazy :p
1615707126,So why you wish you weren't trading
1615707129,I don't get it lol
1615707162,"I bought FET the first time at 0,15 or something like that"
1615707174,Just holding would been better :p
1615707184,Oh haha
1615707192,Yea it was a good gem
1615707199,Possibly more to to from here dw
1615710720,"Hot buy and hold, hot huge pump coming.. hot is trending."
1615711068,Dude why don’t you say hot is hot
1615711074,Missed opportunity
1615711098,"Paper hands. I sold my ADA at a $1500 loss.... Today is not a good day, but I could only see it going down vs. BTC"
1615711153,"you should sell with this loss, double you position at -5%"
1615711211,Was the HOT pump announced here?
1615711223,Is it a pump?
1615711268,"Well u tell me, seems like a one to me"
1615711421,What did you sell it for may I ask?
1615711444,Pump last like 5min
1615711450,This is for hours :p
1615711851,"sorry, I mean did you move it onto another coin?"
1615711911,BTC
1615712033,"Everytime I exchange BTC to another coin in the last 2 months, it's like I've already missed the boat and it tanks. So I'm keeping BTC as it is, and only buying into decent looking ICOs"
1615712184,"Buying into decent looking ICOs ? Fuck that, go all in Magikarp (MAGI)"
1615712195,how did you even manage to get a loss on ada?
1615712393,"0.1 worth of BTC at beginning of this month worth $6100 today, yet same amount invested into ADA at same point is worth $3800 today"
1615712427,"So I bought 0.1 BTC worth, sold and received 0.068 BTC"
1615712440,So my loss is probably more
1615712451,It's too early in the morning to work it out
1615712534,
1615713139,shouldve held instead of selling
1615713141,"around 1k lost in capital, and 1k in btc appreciation opportunity"
1615713146,its okay man youll get it back
1615713205,"but yeah, probably should have at least kept half your position"
1615713312,"Crypto is easy guys :
1. You are a good trader : do day trades, get massive profits on leverages, flex on this chat.
2. You are an idiot (me) : buy, stake, forget, come back next year."
1615713391,is anyone bullish on bnb or cake?
1615713569,"bnb getting huge amounts of new signups, could be nice for pancake swap considering eth fees"
1615713691,I think $BTC could go as high as $73k this month
1615713704,I hope not 😦
1615713718,Why? Then alt season begins
1615713726,85k by may
1615713726,Lets keep it stable for a while
1615713735,Alt season is the last step before meltdown
1615713740,Then it’s all over again 😦
1615713748,Why stable instead of $73k?
1615713753,Do you hate money?
1615713760,That I can make money on trades
1615713762,:p
1615713781,Fair enough brother
1615713837,Why?
1615713862,So alt season step 1: top 10 coins
1615713868,Step 2: low cap
1615713875,Yep
1615713894,Except for XRP which seems to be flatlining ahead of their hearing
1615713946,"btc halving, stock 2 flow model, and bitcoin rainbow chart"
1615713970,I guess it's bad for people who don't hold BTC
1615713971,only 2 historical data points but hey it's been accurate so far 👀
1615714156,I will not get enough money in before altseason if/when it should hit 😦
1615714629,Time to buy some? As even if xpr loose in US. The world is still big. There is life outside US 🙂
1615714667,"I think XRP is an absolute scamcoin but I do think it's a good buy, indications are the hearing won't be so bad for them"
1615714711,is HOT too late to buy now?
1615714712,If I were to buy some. Is to sale with some profit. Not all in and hold 🙂
1615714732,"Yep, I hold a small amount"
1615714743,It’s COLD that u should buy 🙂
1615714769,Small like few hundreds or thousands 🤔
1615714778,let me check
1615714789,500 XRP
1615714805,it's only worth like $227 atm
1615714826,Even if it goes 50€ more. Still money 💰
1615714835,Every little helps
1615714871,I think XRP will go to $1.50 if they even survive the legal case
1615714910,XMR is where the big money opportunity is with atomic swaps
1615714918,Good reasonable thought.  I don’t expect 100$ per coin lol
1615714950,imagine all the dark web vendors sitting on piles of dodgy BTC atm
1615714968,Wow.. the price of it now ..💆🏻
1615714982,soon they'll be able to convert to XMR without trusting a 3rd party and fully anonymise their holdings
1615714996,demand for XMR will go up like a fucking rocket
1615715053,Good food for thought. Thank u 🙏🏻
1615715083,Plus you can buy lots of drugs with XMR so it's very useful to have even if it doesn't moon
1615715819,Remember to look at the amount of coins in circulation not just the price of the coin
1615715925,Anyone checked out XYO network on coinmarketcap? Seems like a pretty easy pump target
1615715959,We dont do pumps
1615716029,I prefer to trade coins that have solid fundamentals. Just like I prefer to trade stocks on the NYSE versus Penny stocks.
1615716102,Makes sense
1615716158,I bet some have been sitting on their BTC since 2012/13 they’ll have millions!!!
1615716242,The bitcoin wallets associated with the Empire Market exit scam have over $1bn dollars worth of BTC in them. They will convert to XMR once atomic swaps go live and they’ll then be untraceable. XMR will moon.
1615716347,So now would still be a good entry point or is it likely to dip a bit before all this happens?
1615716404,Personally I think any entry point before atomic swaps is good but there could still be significant swings before then. I spend and replace XMR weekly.
1615716755,"apparently atomic swaps already exist, komodo has an Atomic Dex for a while now"
1615716908,Only testnets
1615716956,Maybe I should start mining some XMR

1615726011,Difference between a great coin and the only coin. Something no one is telling you without shilling (DM only?)
1615726012,I bought some enj last night and when I woke up this morning I added 100€ to my binance account to get the liquidation point a bit further away. Then I sold the position for a nice profit at 2.11. 🤡 that could have been an astronomical profit just a bit later.
1615726092,So what's the next entry point going to be?
1615726105,2.18-2.2
1615726132,"Yikes. Alright, I'll adjust my buy order."
1615726141,"Monster coin, that thing"
1615726145,"Id wait a bit to see what BTC does today, but we're not going to stay so low for much longer"
1615726166,"""so low"", you mean under 5?"
1615726182,"Yeah, but i meant more before 2.5 for now."

1615726374,🥳
1615726428,Yes. Too bad there was no one to help you.
1615726461,Wait until they launch on cb (not confirmed)
1615726475,"@David R. For future reference, you want to exit ENJ for a bit its fine, just look at the trend first for the timing on exit and entry. 1D trend"
1615726489,"I thought it was confirmed? And if they do, I’m hoping for the price to increase like previous coins 🙂"
1615726504,"Haha. That will shoot up CB price, not ENJ (joke)"

1615726972,Thank you ❤️
1615727014,"Heh. No. I mean dont put a number to it now (like it will go up more than 40%). Just put it in there, and hope it goes up. Theres no point of assuming, but there is point in hoping."
1615727065,"Im saying because i did this as well, and even though at the end of it you dont really lose money, its just really dissapointing when it doesnt hit what you had pictured in your head."

1615729831,Thing is you just never know when it'll stop rising so you only know you've bought at the ATH when it declines for days after 😭
1615729855,People could profit from my bad trades: just do the opposite of me: guaranteed $$$
1615730273,"That would be a bullish reversal. But I understood it as ""reversal from bull trend"". The context makes it clear though that you are to profit from a short, i.e. the price going down."
1615730461,Wait till you see what's next! 😉
1615730536,"Okay, then let's rephrase to ""entering at **a** ATH""
Because there will come a retraction before the next big ATH. Sure, it might go up even more...
Like Bitcoin. Suppose you got in at 52k on Feb 18. Yeah it shot up to 58k for a nice 11.5% gain, but then it went down and could be bought for as low as 43k before ATH'ing again."
1615730675,"At the very least don't buy all at the top, leave some capital for the next dip."
1615731075,how do i see the post grad channel
1615731135,Invite 5 people.
1615731226,ah okay thanks
1615731266,"yeah, that was my conclusion yesterday as well 😄"
1615731639,Thank you for the clarification. I must have looked at the wrong chart this morning. 😃 I even googled bull reversal to make sure that I don't misunderstand the call.
1615731708,thoughts on ada? when can we start to potentially see a rise?
1615731808,"I even added the little downtrend emoji on the call 😆
📉"
1615731823,ADA is for sure long term.
1615731830,If you want reasonable profits.
1615733331,Not sure I'd agree with that unless you got in v early
1615733382,What’s anyone’s thoughts on long hodling LTC
1615734126,I think I got it right now. 😁
1615734299,Why's that
1615734310,I got in at $1
1615734349,"Rather than investing into BTC or eth. I have a longterm portfolio made up of HBAR, ADA and VET"
1615734575,ADA/BTC
1615734597,And?
1615734623,"I doubt myself too, I feel like I’ve got into ADA too late, got in at just over a dollar, hoping long term it’ll go up but not so sure :c"
1615734708,My long term target for ADA is $7.
1615734715,And when I mean long term I don't mean 1 year😅
1615734774,All of these are going to ride the momentum by ETH they're all definitely going up a lot. Every on of them a minimum of 3x in the long term. And that's where I siphon my trading profits to.
1615734786,You can be earning more by holding BTC than ADA
1615734807,Well not right now!
1615734818,I'm a new trader.
1615734831,When I entered the market btc was already getting to its first high.
1615734837,58k
1615734872,"I would never get 2x in BTC. But for HBAR, VET and ADA. 2x is a piece of cake. On a 2 to 5 year hold."
1615734890,I'll copy and paste what I wrote a few hours ago
1615734892,"0.1 worth of BTC at beginning of this month is now worth $6100 today, yet same amount 0.1 BTC invested into ADA at the start of the month is now worth $3800 today"
1615735014,"So yeah, I wouldn't be recommending ADA if you want profit 😂"
1615735275,ENJ AND SLP MOONING AGAIN
1615735713,Dude it’s up 2-3%
1615735722,Your definition of mooning :p
1615735756,2.7%
1615735979,"""breakout"""
1615736136,
1615736267,"Btc to 100k in 2-5 years is a very safe bet imo, i definitely think you're wrong"
1615736271,To the moon bois
1615736786,Unless something else replaces BTC. Insanely long shot but it's possible.
1615736808,Eth 2.0 is coming out. Eventually something will replace BTC. Which is why I'm investing in the newer coins.
1615736824,But eth is definitely going to be very big.
1615736833,Even 5x this year is possible.
1615737040,What exchanges do you guys recommend to cover all bases in terms of buying all or most of the altcoins available? I know yesterday I asked if there was a one stop shop for altcoins/shitcoins but I realize now all exchanges are different.
1615737332,YESSS
1615738613,SLP sounds like an interesting venture - are you banking on the game rising in popularity?
1615738641,it's called AXS yup
1615738659,you need SLP to breed them together
1615738664,Slllllp sounds like someone that produces too much spit all the time
1615738761,Small Love Potion is a cute name and I know you shouldn't invest on names buuuuuuuttttttt... 😂 😂 😂
1615738786,Okay for any doubters this is the enjin chart I sent to @Alanox yesterday
1615738869,Moon
1615738883,The coin diversity is not working out today
1615738921,What’s a good entry point for ENJ?
1615738934,"This VET on coinbase, any sources on it?"
1615738986,in my honest opinion at this point anything below $3 mid to long hodl only
1615739076,hello
1615739131,I had an alert set if it dropped back down to 2.2 and it didn’t trigger even though it should’ve
1615739136,🧐
1615739144,This is not the first time Binance has done this to me
1615739216,what are your thoughts on skycoin 🧐
1615739631,Just bought some SYL 😮
1615739676,Need to do the kyc now I guess it might be declined ... since my identity card has a temp address change sticker on it ...
1615739860,"Im pretty sure binance alerts dont work properly lol, happened to me too a few times"
1615739937,I think btc is correcting to high 58k
1615739942,they're always delayed
1615739946,CMC alerts are better
1615740086,Phase 3 is almost sold out! 😲
1615740115,Niice :) this is going so fast lol
1615740243,What happens next?
1615740255,Please don’t say phase 4 lmao
1615740266,when was 80% ?
1615740282,No
1615740352,Nah its the end of the ICO iirc
1615740383,Nope
1615740448,
1615740482,Do we know which exchanges it's going to be on?
1615740490,Not saying that ADA is necessarily a better short term investment than BTC but we could reverse this statement if we used a different 2 week time frame
1615740538,From the 19th Feb to the 4th of March BTC was down yet ADA was up
1615740545,same 2 week time frame
1615740574,Best grab some more SYL then
1615740605,Man I wish I had the $$ but I'm saving some for Casper
1615740712,Negative correlation

1615740995,"anyone know about the pumps schedued for today?
looking to know which group has a good track record"
1615741108,https://twitter.com/binance/status/1371139723616468994?s=20 Binance competition if anyone is interested
1615741172,Could that correlation reverse relatively quickly? the article doesn't talk about what causes a change in correlation
1615741216,"Yeah, sure. It's not a given"
1615741228,But it seems to hold for some weeks now
1615742095,hey guys! I have already tried out multiple pumps and have to sadly say I only lost until now (not big amounts since I play safe first to test the waters). Do you know and can recommend any groups that are legit and not all about scamming? When the coin is announced I buy 12 seconds later and sell 16 seconds after the buy announcement
1615742335,Only way to win is to use a bot
1615742401,wait for the really big pumps
1615742406,small pumps are scams
1615742423,"been thinking about that too, which bot do you recommend?"
1615742433,Yea I noticed that :/
1615742463,"march 21st is a big one, that the one to throw your money at"
1615742577,wsb crypto pumps?
1615742891,Any idea the possible price of SYL in like 2 year ?
1615742933,Pretty much all pumps are scams
1615742954,$10
1615743085,no clue
1615743096,10 would be incredible
1615743177,i would absolutely sell much earlier than $10 bc i have fucking paper ass hands
1615743231,im defs hodlign until eoy
1615743264,Even ones with over 200k people.
1615743282,😔lost a lot to pumps. Not a part of any pump groups anymore.
1615743310,Guys does any of you have any idea of upcoming or existing ICOs that's a must buy?
1615743363,"Syl, casper are the ones we are buying atm (lots of ppl on this server)"
1615743370,But please dyor on them

1615746625,Imagine syl 1 usd and like at least 2000 giga chad whales in it😂😂
1615746633,but there was some BInance plan if I am not mistaken. that should move price nicely
1615746671,IF 0.3
1615746760,Casper probably the more likely to $1 within 12 months I think
1615746813,

1615748291,No. I have been at waterloo once tho
1615748319,"Buying SYL was not as easy as I thought. I was just on my phone and the site kept reverting to French. When I saw that it is possible to pay with LTC I went on Binance to buy some, but I couldn't find the withdrawal option in the app. I figured it must be P2P, but there was no LTC, so I had to convert my LTC which I just bought to BTC and send that to te P2P wallet. There I figured that the transaction fee is unproportionally expensive for BTC unless you use the Binance Smart chain, but I didn't know whether XLS labs supports that. Also apparently that P2P-wallet is just for transactions between Binance-users. So I transferd the BTC back to the spot wallet, traded it back for LTC and while I was waiting for the transaction to go through, I signed in on a browser, where I could finally withdraw that LTC to XLS."
1615748362,Just learn french 5Head
1615748379,i mean tbf

1615748399,My grandpa used to live here. He died 3 years ago. We bought the house from my dads siblings. Threw everything down and then me and my cousin build the two houses. We spend 6 months on it.

1615748403,Welcome to ICO’s

1615748416,I got a business partner who runs a B&B hotel in a historic Brugge building. Looks like early 1800
1615748470,Not syl's fault that binance withdrawal is weird on the app
1615748495,"I'm not blaming SYL, I blame Binance"
1615748510,"I only blame SYL for the French, which is not the fault of Binance 😀"
1615748519,"So SYL is my first ICO, what comes next now it’s ended? What do I have to do?"

1615748843,Ima get that license plate if SYL gives me Lambo
1615748856,"Yeah exactly, most belgian buildings look like that 💀"
1615748857,I know
1615748868,YSL 🤦‍♂️
1615748883,How many kids does the average Belgian have? 7. 3 locked up in the basement and 4 buried in the yard
1615748896,It's a joke back from the day Marc Dutroux made news 😏
1615748956,I've been once in Belgium and the houses look beautiful. Comparing it to UK is like Ancient Europe vs today's Africa
1615749059,Oh god.
1615749083,Bro 👀
1615749088,U know thats a good idea
1615749105,😭😭

1615749181,As kids we went on a school trip and ur legit laughing and running up stairs of bones
1615749183,💀💀
1615749251,I think someone mentioned something about binance
1615749262,Just completed the XSL KYC. Now they have everything they need to steal my identity after the rugpull. 😄
1615749289,Isn't that the average Austrian?
1615749423,Don't forget about this couple of Kongo people buried under the house as well
1615749481,Austrians only has daughters
1615749895,so considering alice currently doesnt have a price
1615749898,Can’t post link
1615749905,On binance abs XYl
1615749906,what are we predicing itl be at after the first minute
1615749914,Can dm so it will be posted

1615750214,whats the bet some poor sod accidently buys it at 100k
1615750219,immediately
1615750226,Sure
1615750269,I did it too but still no news if they accepted it or not
1615750348,I got approved pretty fast
1615750356,Yeah same
1615750363,Compared to Casper which said days
1615750375,XSL stole my identity in minutes
1615750379,https://t.co/WDOJSA4Tw8
1615750414,@TheOne this doesn’t necessarily mean it will launch on binance platform though
1615750458,Same here.
1615750483,Anyone have any insight as to when LOOM may launch on Coinbase public?
1615750491,Still some moves toward possible launch 🙂
1615750500,I've read a lot of speculation but haven't really heard any timelines
1615750572,I’m hopeful it will at least double to get money back. (XYl) and then it will moon in 1-2 years or more. I’ll wait 💆🏻‍♂️
1615750640,the only legal pump and dump is towards cryptocurrency
1615750671,Arguably legal. It might actually be illegal
1615750774,When’s the stimulus check coming?
1615750780,Because of price manipulation
1615750783,? 😮
1615751138,17th is the posting date although it may be getting credited to peoples banks already. I will prob get mine tomorrow as my bank does 2 day early Direct Deposit
1615751169,@David R.  from where do you have the news/rumour about VET on coinbase?
1615751334,Yeah I’m a bit scared I get decline since I moved and I have a temporary sticker on my driver license
1615751344,"See that’s what I’m confused about now, when coinbase was trending on Twitter yesterday, I saw an article (that looked like it was from coinbase) saying VeChain was being listed..but then I checked on the coinbase blogs and I literally can’t see anything about it. I feel like I’ve given out false information and I apologise if I have. 😦"
1615751347,@kittiewitty
1615751353,I hope thats my listing and he does a market buy 🤣  I hope thats ELon too
1615751362,finesse my man elon one time
1615751373,Thx
1615751446,"But I could have sworn I saw it somewhere, it was definitely within a link...that looked like coinbase. But I’m really sorry if it’s not happening, as I can’t find that same article anymore"
1615751457,"The real question is: Is there an overview over which coins will get listed when on coinbase with all relevant dates? Release on coinbase pro, start of trading, regular release"
1615751510,"I tried looking for that too and couldn’t immediately find it, although it was a brief look"
1615751558,"Why should try to collect that information in a channel here, if @Alanox  approves"
1615751683,wym?
1615751729,We need to maintain a calendar that keeps track of when coins get released on coinbase
1615751763,so we can be on board of the rocket before it launches 🚀
1615751801,"Ah, I could develop one. Is there any place to fetch that information from?"
1615751825,It’s weird that no one in any group is talking about luna when it’s absolutely bullish is everyone just sleeping on it?
1615751839,I’ve been riding it since $2 it’s at $16 now
1615751840,"Not as far as I know. The only way I can see how this could work for now would be a user-maintained calendar, perhaps in a dedicated channel"
1615752052,"I think @Drahnreb’s calendar idea is really smart, as far as I’m aware Coinbase tends to announce that they’re going to list a coin in ~1 week on their blogs, I’m not sure if we’d be able to get on it much sooner than that."
1615752058,https://blog.coinbase.com/polygon-matic-skale-network-skl-and-sushiswap-sushi-are-launching-on-coinbase-pro-460f410b3820
1615752062,9th March
1615752097,2 days later they were listed.. so not even a week
1615752105,Right but where can we see which new coins will be listed?
1615752124,"Alright, anything similar for other exchanges?"
1615752199,Additionally some of the coins might announce on their sites that they will launch on coinbase or other exchanges
1615752204,Casper is giving staking rewards on option 1 after all
1615752208,8%
1615752235,"we'll have to trawl the web for information, 100% old school"
1615752238,@Drahnreb @David R. I’ll look into implementing this tomorrow. I might have to develop my own bot for that
1615752249,until @Alanox finds a a way to automate this
1615752282,"If you actually manage to create a bot that successfully finds that information, you got a solid product to sell"
1615752285,Automation might be hard but worth a test I guess. Possible with AI but all entries would still have to be approved by real humans
1615752342,There’s also a way to automate using users 😉 I can explain in dm

1615752500,Current Enjin sell walls
1615752539,thoughts on ada?
1615752548,"Not too sure but I can happily look into this for you and DM any information I found about it? If so, what sort of exchanges would you like me to consider?

Would be epic if this was doable! I’ll help as much as I can"

1615752608,Probably Binance and the smaller one’s like Kucoin?
1615752626,"For sure, I’ll look into it for you dad"
1615753080,Hey same boat! I made 150$ off a 15 minute ENJ trade 🙏
1615753100,slowly but surely eating away at that -2k alcohol bender
1615753102,please don't hit 2.29 :kekw:
1615753106,Any predictions how high enj will push?
1615753130,its already pushed a lot today; I personally am not getting back in for risk of it already hitting its peak today
1615753135,Sell now or hodl?
1615753151,depends on if you are working with futures or not
1615753163,"HODL if you own it, sell if you have futures in it IMO"
1615753165,Nah just bought coin for quick turnover
1615753185,for quick turnovers I actually recommend futures
1615753195,Im scared of those lol
1615753215,You should try them out. One you get comfortable with them they can make you ALOT more money
1615753229,do 2-5x with some pocket change
1615753235,I promise its not as scary as it sounds
1615753238,Even more than you lose with them.
1615753261,I wanna try just not sure how m7ch to risk to start
1615753282,like he said pocket change
1615753287,20-50 bucks maybe 100
1615753291,Yep! If you are good enough at least. Made 250 last night. Made another 200 today. the amount of movement those trades would have needed is so much higher with no leverage
1615753292,I am doing 100 bets
1615753296,Lol thats subjective as hell
1615753308,Pocket chamge for elon much diff than for me
1615753313,Exactly why I didnt say a number
1615753322,"pocket change for you, not pocket change for me"
1615753328,100 aint bad
1615753331,do YOUR def of pocket change
1615753341,https://tenor.com/view/sminem-green-stand-gif-16954410
1615753344,that way you can trial it before getting into big trades
1615753356,Thoughts about Cardano?
1615753371,unclear
1615753377,Negative
1615753378,Cardano is on a pacemaker
1615753380,lost 20$ shorting it today 😂 Have no clue if its going to actually recover though
1615753398,still a great long term hodl imho but we will see. I am still green with it so ATM I don't care tbh
1615753436,honestly thats how I felt about my extremely long hold ETH trade. I started it at 1500 and I would have taken it to 2k if I didnt accidentally close it
1615753451,the dips didnt matter because of how early I started that trade
1615753459,Enj to 2.50.. lets go you dirty birdy
1615753466,"they really should have a ""ARE YOU SURE"" thing"
1615753482,"Agreed. Once I had to reopen it, it wasnt worth the risk"
1615753490,1712 liq is spooky
1615753491,@That one belgian super cunt they need that as a life button in general
1615753494,What do you mean by that
1615753514,Can you teach me. I'll pay you in %
1615753524,if you put in 50 bucks on a 10X a 10% increase is a double
1615753527,it dipped to 4$ away from my liq and I was paying like 120$ a day instead of 24$ a day
1615753530,"You will lose money, potentially a lot, but as Jeremy said, you can gain much more than that"
1615753540,✌🏻️✊🏻accidentally✊🏻✌🏻️
1615753543,not if you use isolated
1615753545,Made 150 with cyber but dropped out was to risky at the end
1615753562,I can help you. I dont take commission nor do I give signals
1615753564,you cna lose a lot of money on isolated if you put in alot of money
1615753578,"Then you even risk money losing unneccessarily, if your position briefly dips below liq right before mooning"
1615753578,I dont mind helping people with futures though
1615753596,Thats why you manage your leverage properly
1615753604,Ofcourse. A 10% drop = liquidation
1615753610,thats also why I recommend 2-5x leverage
1615753619,when you are new
1615753626,:kekw: damn enj
1615753646,please stop triggering my fomo 😦
1615753659,don't. I am terrified
1615753668,adrenaline is pumping somewhat
1615753676,the thing is people get scared of futures because they think its going to be a tiny ass dip to liquidate. Your legit trades should NEVER be a tiny ass dip away from liquidation
1615753679,futures is actual insnae
1615753688,like the pressure you feel
1615753689,Im just 1 month into crypto and I've learned about FOMO its something dangerous
1615753690,every second
1615753698,Its all about risk management
1615753710,TBH a btc future at 10X isn't bad. the chance of a sudden 10% drop is relatively low
1615753729,i just wish binance lets you put in TP and SL at %
1615753730,It's cost me a lot
1615753731,rather than a set numbre
1615753743,Thats how I feel. I recommend 2-5x to start primarily because mostly everyone fucks up their first few trades but 10x is my fav
1615753752,Yea i lost 50% on NEM in 2 days
1615753755,lack of FOMO on post grad signals has cost me alot of potential profit
1615753792,The biggest mistake you can make is not going all in when Crypto-Domme makes a call
1615753817,"To put it in perspective on how NONRISKY futures can be, a 2x future at 60k BTC has a liquidation point of 30,000"
1615753853,"Do you feel comfortable with the idea that Bitcoin doesnt have a high chance of dipping to 30,000$ overnight? Then 2x leverage is within your risk tolerance"
1615753869,"Like so? 😉
`ENJ: New peak at 2.4818 $! Gained 24.99% from entry @ 1.98566 $`"
1615753872,How long could you leave that in there for before the fees generate a high enough to the point where it seems pointless doing the future?
1615753941,"Forever. Fees are based on percentage of your base and are only charged to the winners. If your crypto is going up, you will be paying a fee based on a percentage of your base but the thing is, your only getting charged that fee BECAUSE its going up"
1615754001,100% like so
1615754029,Liquidation is more of a risk than fee management. The only time you lose money on a green trade is if you sell at a very very low amount of PNL. I always recommend avoiding selling at 10$ PNL or less because most of the time the sell fees are 6-8$
1615754030,Jeremy i think u got me addicted to futures. especially shorts
1615754054,I personally am also addicted to futures. I dont even waste my time with spot trading anymore
1615754085,The only time I do anything spot is buying a tiny coin that doesnt have a future yet
1615754090,"Oh that’s cool to know. So if I put in, let’s say £15 (because im poor) on a 5x leverage with a liq position of $48k, could that potentially be something I could leave in for a month and generate a fair bit of profit for it just sitting there?"
1615754097,"Any gems lately? Looking at rsr, rune, Matic"
1615754129,In futures I just don't get it how to make a short trade. Just set a buy order lower than current price?
1615754131,Stay away from rune. it just keeps going down
1615754146,It will bring you profit but it may not bring the profit you are looking for. BTC takes a large amount of money to gain a small amount of percentage so it normally isnt worth much doing a future on
1615754160,I somehow accidently made a short bet and started loosing when it was going up 🤦‍♂️
1615754170,:kekw:
1615754178,Thats sexy as hell
1615754179,142% atm
1615754186,good shit belgian
1615754191,Shorts make you money when the price of the coin goes down
1615754194,Its only with 100 bucks worth
1615754208,"Ah good advice, thank you - thought I was on to something there lol :c"
1615754241,so you normally do a short when you see a unnatural spike. This will bring you profits when it goes through corrections
1615754256,you can also do a short when you think a coin is going to fail
1615754275,man ENJ is a beast
1615754297,Basically a short is like buying negative of that coin. Eventually you have to buy back that coin to fill the negative up so you want to buy back the coin at a lower price so you make profits
1615754311,Damn so basically 'selling' can be also used for buying short
1615754343,"Yes. If you use the Reduce only option, it will only reduce longs though. It wont flip the switch on it changing it to a short"
1615754365,"Kk, thank you @Jeremyfto"
1615754369,"guys, which coins were pumped today?"
1615754371,You're a star :D
1615754391,Smart stuff this
1615754395,"So, excellent shorting opp?!"
1615754411,Yeah. If only someone had shilled it
1615754411,Maybe. Im shorting SFP right now
1615754416,"@Jeremyfto You should change your nick to ""jETHremyFUTURESto"" 😄"
1615754431,For Shivas sake! Drop it!!
1615754476,😒
1615754479,I think I would get hung for that one since I dont own any ETH at the moment 😂
1615754494,WING and SFP good shors right now
1615754497,look at WING lol
1615754523,once it stops im shorting
1615754529,"So on a chart like this, am i correct in thinking that it’s safe to say there’s going to be a correction here so it’s best to short this?"
1615754551,Maybe a dumb question but is the polynetwork bridge for Zilliqa with eth good or
1615754554,"You betrayed the ""ETH to 2k club"" 😱"
1615754569,He's a naughty boy
1615754594,I betrayed it when I was 10$ from liq one night while I was sleeping
1615754598,"Dangerous. The trend is your friend. **If** you short, only for a very short time. Because the moment it will continue the uptrend, it'll wreck your position"
1615754616,"If I still had my 1500 entry position, I would still HODL to this day"
1615754621,:kekw: how things change
1615754625,Come on WING stop pumping so i can short
1615754627,but accidentally selling and fucking my entry just fucks things up
1615754647,"If you're experienced in wave riding you could take the swings down with shorts, but if you start out it's best to just use it as a dip opp for your next long"
1615754667,I dont see a WING future. Where are you shorting it at?
1615754676,"Ah okay that makes sense, thank you man"
1615754684,oh i was just checking the charts isnt it on futures?
1615754686,ffs
1615754690,Lol. You're the one to talk. We're you the biggest crit?
1615754824,"i think you can still technically short it right?
transfer btc into the 3x iso, and then do a borrow sell, (should be able to sell more than you have), then buy it back at a lower price to repay the the borrow"
1615754867,that works i think
1615754873,it might not
1615754874,havent tried it
1615754915,I am just enjoying the futures
1615754966,Yes. With margin trading you can also short
1615754970,SYL is going to be exciting
1615754984,Where to 125x SYL futures?
1615754992,Lol. Thats just a waste
1615754992,LMAO if only pls
1615755029,When syl will be available on binance approx ?
1615755041,over a year prbs
1615755049,also possible for it to not get listed ever
1615755059,but almost certinaly not before eoy
1615755073,Well since it’s using binance tech might help
1615755092,Zilliqa approaching last ATH opinions?
1615755095,Considering its a BSC coin it probably might come in
1615755142,id say before mid 2022 is likely if it grows as projected
1615755189,if it grows super fast after august then maybe before eoy
1615755203,I'm curious which exchanges they will be on so we can transfer them
1615755208,QKC is doing great
1615755211,"Imagine if we could open a 125x future on 0,000003$ SYL now"
1615755215,👀
1615755237,https://twitter.com/j0hnnyw00/status/1371105367984324608?s=20
1615755243,drops to 0.00002 and you go broke
1615755255,`QKC: New peak at 60 sats! Gained 30.43% from entry @ 46 sats`
1615755402,nah open a X10. watch it go 50000% up
1615755426,but imagine a 125x
1615755427,"As usual, no one listened when I spoke .... KKk I love it"
1615755428,Where can you buy SYL?
1615755435,you cant anymore
1615755440,ico ended couple hrs ago
1615755454,Ah
1615755456,gotta wait a while now to get some
1615755473,I bought enough to hold it until it pops
1615755488,Who's slapping down leverages on what then lol
1615755501,we can dream
1615755511,obviously cant leverage trade syl
1615755517,but imagine if you could
1615755540,the dumps from people selling their longs would hurt though
1615755560,Yeah lol i just meant in general for now to cure my boredom till SYL comes back
1615755599,"Dude, I didn't see it through all the noise."
1615755607,What does it mean when the ico ended? (I’m a noob)
1615755622,the ICO ended. the presale of the coin
1615755631,ICO is the first sale period of the coin
1615755633,its essentially kickstarter
1615755651,"Oh rip me, what exchange was it on?"
1615755654,none
1615755658,their own website
1615755658,not an exchange
1615755681,think of it as buying security in a stock that is not yet public
1615755685,Ah I see. Thanks guys
1615755692,but its a crypto instead of a stock
1615755695,You guys got a leg up on everyone else then!
1615755711,you too can get post grads signals with invites
1615755742,david is a senior
1615755743,so they have it
1615755755,prolly meant @DRAKO
1615755761,he the only one in this convo w/o senior
1615755789,Ah was it announced in post grads and I missed it? Damn

1615756038,This was the most recent call for it: https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807387265152057374/818816394878910484
1615756060,"Thanks bud, I’m silly for not looking more into that, big regrets"
1615756061,"Problem is, it's usually referred to as ""XSL"" from XSL labs. Coin is SYL tho"
1615756070,Yeah think that confused me a little hehe
1615756077,"tbh, Swiss posts a couple of ICOs and new projects every week"
1615756086,I don't look into all of them either
1615756122,I’ll be sure to look out more in future :p
1615756227,Talk about XSL / SYL was more intense than for most
1615756240,It’s Enj .2 lol
1615756240,If only people hadn't been constantly talking only about ENJ every minute... 😉
1615756276,I have article about XSL.  Will post it to jelly maybe he post it here as I can’t post links
1615756485,So SYL isn’t SYLO then?

1615757718,lol I didn't have xrp so i don't have flare
1615757720,oh well.
1615757782,okay if you bought XRP after Dec 12 you have no Spark
1615757788,"Hey guys, could I send my chart analysis to someone on BATUSD new and it would help"

1615758438,"Guys all the token you are talkin about vet algo one zil etc......

1615758625,"i just saw a video on youtube by linus tech tips about mining, and while most of his viewers are condemning him because he always was against it, i'm sure a lot of people are gonna give it a try with nicehash... i dont know how this could affect the markets, but it's a news"
1615758650,"@Jeremyfto is there a way to change a future buy order, thats already been bought, from cross to isolated?"
1615758665,For some reason mine is alwaysd automatically on cross
1615758666,"the title of the video is literally ""Mine Crypto Before It's Too Late!"""
1615758670,And i forgot to change
1615758678,No there is not unfortunately
1615758686,My bad I thought it was a discord everyone can talk in @felguerr  😂 😂 😂

1615758823,Ffffff
1615758835,???? Whyyy
1615758868,i sold it along with xrp when the sec shit happened
1615758872,damn
1615758875,You owned a diamond
1615758879,Crazyyyyy
1615758883,Lol
1615758890,Send
1615758893,I buy
1615758900,well cant blame for the SEC shit making people FUD
1615758913,Sec will do nothing agains xrp
1615758923,you can buy yourself too no?
1615758932,@ingenious you were rewarded ?
1615758935,XFLR is not the real thing though
1615758936,Or you buy
1615758942,XFLR is an IOU on the real FLR
1615758948,Correct
1615758952,i got airdropped
1615758970,Man !!!!
1615758996,You sold without looking their roadmap ?
1615759016,oh right I got through my casper KYC
1615759069,"😦
aree you guys buying it right now?"
1615759083,Buying what? 😅
1615759092,The only two way to buy is poloniex and bittrue
1615759096,it is listed on polonix
1615759097,yeah
1615759102,But carefull
1615759114,knowing swiss if he is bullish about it yeah you lost good stuff
1615759116,I dont remember in which the price is higher
1615759128,its .248 at polo
1615759151,Yeah thats cuz it is a full spark
1615759184,Seeing swiss this excited about a project makes me uneasy
1615759190,"oof, i got to sleep and wake up $300 richer"
1615759191,ty enj
1615759194,He wasnt even this enthusiastic about syl
1615759211,classic australian time zones
1615759216,Swiss is only enthusiastic about chsb
1615759274,My mistake this is the contrary
1615759276,"ON Bittrue the IOU is 1:1 to FLR when, main net launch youll have the same amount purchased on bittrue... thats the diference of price, Let me explain.

Bittrue gave just 15% of the air drop to its users that means if one person holded 100 XRP on the FLR snapshot they will recieve 100 flr but bittrue released only 15 IOU for that person so the ratio are 1 IOU on the exchange its 1 real FLR they are trading only 15% of the available tokens when mainnet launches later on MAY so dont worrie , they are supporting even the dFLR airdrop because of this as i know. thats why its 25 cents now.

on the other side , Poloniex gave 100% of the airdrop to its users that means if one person holded 100 xrp on the FLR snapshot they will recieve 100 FLR , poloniex released 100 IOUS for that person so the ratio are 100 IOUS on the exchange its only 15% Real flare. that means They are trading with 100% of the avaliable tokens so when main net launch if you bought 100 IOUS on Poloniex they will only give you 15 FLRs."
1615759291,Chsb is my wealth management
1615759317,But my wallet is 20+ different coin
1615759327,Splitted by sector
1615759333,And different market cap
1615759352,"damn
if we buy xflr right now, we get 15% of real flare later?"
1615759372,On bittrue
1615759374,Yep
1615759383,Thats why i was surprised you sold you got full for free man
1615759431,wheeeee
1615759435,it was in dec
1615759446,Keep in mind long termmmmmmmm
1615759450,Alwayssssssss
1615759459,I dont know enough about blockchains and crypto to understand this in depth info
1615759471,i guess i listened to somme stupid yooutuber who said sell xrp
1615759482,and i sold it along with it
1615759489,I know no worries there is a lot
1615759492,A youtuber 😭😭
1615759503,Chexk crypto news on google
1615759540,"they all say btc will go high or low
and if it goes high they say, btc went high EXACTLY as predicted
and if it goes low they say the same."
1615759547,Do you guys see another jump for CHZ in the future?
1615759554,Yes
1615759559,i am learning stuff gradually lol
1615759579,U can buy XPR on Revolut... if u guys use it:) I have referl if u want to join lol:)
1615759585,Bit salty today about the money I put into it (mostly because I took that money from ENJ)
1615759630,Never buy crypto on revolut
1615759638,You dont own them
1615759638,You know you don't actually own any Crypto with Revolut
1615759651,Overpriced too
1615759653,And fees are enormous
1615759659,"its the same with binance too, no?"
1615759659,Totally
1615759670,Price fluctuation less favorable
1615759674,Just don't :D
1615759691,"Er, no you do actually buy and own the coin/token on Binance because you can transfer out."
1615759714,Now that I have bought some SYL what’s the bep20 address ? I guess it’s a private walllet ? Any app recommended? Can I use binance directly
1615759747,i was going to buy some on revolut  but when i sew 10+ £ fees.. i was like.. Screw u!  but beside that revolut is great!:)
1615759765,good question!!!! please tell me too!
1615759775,I think first they need announce which exchanges / wallets are going to support syl. Or please correct me if I'm wrong
1615759784,"You don't need one just yet though, right"
1615759784,so is the suggestion to buy xflr or flr?
1615759795,Not now but pretty soon
1615759795,Because you will need deposit address
1615759840,I find it quite useful when I'm travelling abroad. You don't even have to exchange and pay in your currency abroad
1615759841,It’s say we need BEP-20 address provided before 31 March
1615759864,If you are not comfortable with blockchain i would say learn first on flare process. Cuz when you own xflr then you need some step to do
1615759869,They will send an email about it around 21 March but I might need to setup something before
1615759907,"Meh, I was an early Revolut user, but I just use a Credit card that has no FX fees. You've got more rights / insurance that way"
1615759953,NSPX!
1615760024,Anyway I've made a wire transfer from revolut to coinlist but I'm afraid of the fees 🤦‍♂️
1615760044,Because I've read somewhere it could be even 30 bucks
1615760128,NPXS** !
1615760471,MxPx!
1615760479,excited my ENJ long with 150 bucks profit. :kekw:
1615760694,You're excited our you exited?
1615760728,@Vincent Scott knows good pop punk
1615760760,:kekw: english how
1615760771,Blink182's biggest fan here (pre 2005)
1615760825,It’s not a phase mom
1615760835,quick short on ENJ. 30 bucks profit
1615760839,im done I am gonna play vidja
1615760841,I still have a Box Car Racer album which is listen to regularly to this day
1615760886,provided by @MotoMoto
1615760945,ngl I still like Good Charlotte
1615761155,"Yeah man, I go through phases of needing to listen to this stuff for a few weeks. 
Tomorrow I'm gonna get +44 blaring out the speakers"
1615761225,I went through a KoRn phase at one point...
1615761467,Enj dropping like a 💣
1615761678,just a *little* closer 😂
1615761711,Lol
1615761759,well there will be window to re buy later for those who exited
1615761802,"I dont wanna pretend like I dont know NFTs are the future of laundering money, but ENJ keeps paying off, so fuck it.  🤣"
1615761906,more like the present
1615761917,Lol touché
1615761922,I MIGHT buy more longs on ENJ
1615761932,Havent decided yet. That dip looks yummy
1615761933,ENJ TO THE MOON
1615761958,"Moon too close, mars at least."
1615761970,Do you think that's it in terms of dip? Not even something family-sized?
1615761995,Thats why I havent decided yet. I dont know if there is more dip to come or not
1615762013,Its a hard thing to call so I am just pondering the idea of buying in right now
1615762018,"If I were to go in here, it'd definitely be isolated margin"
1615762035,oh for sure! I was thinking 10xing isolated
1615762050,but Iv already made more than my 100$ a day today so I dont really NEED to
1615762058,We all edge of our seats on enj chart.. 🤣
1615762059,I think my PNL for today is like 240
1615762073,all day 👀
1615762104,Just short 250 and long 250 at the same time so at least one of your positions succeed
1615762109,https://tenor.com/view/smart-thinking-thoughts-think-ponder-gif-7713620
1615762112,ENJ is like a bumblebee. It just doesn't know it's not supposed to be able to fly
1615762154,What was previous support before this bullrun?  2.30?  Dip back there pls.
1615762167,50% win rate - not bad. If I just do a long at it fails my win rate will be 0% 🧠
1615762188,If its going to dip back to support level my estimate would be 2.40
1615762315,honestly DOGE might be a good short term long
1615762330,I put a long order at 2.4501 now
1615762342,ride it from 0.059 to 0.061 at 10x
1615762365,Make an easy 33%
1615762374,and cancelled it
1615762380,Lol
1615762397,this looks too much like an M of doom
1615762433,https://tenor.com/view/the-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-sam-carrying-carry-gif-15035855
1615762446,Feels like a good long opportunity that 😂
1615762475,KALIMA!
1615762538,Eh depends on if the M of doom brings it down. Then its a good short
1615762542,its too hard to tell right now
1615762552,Im not going to open a position at this current moment
1615762574,Does look like a scary chart :p
1615762598,We have reached the point where DOGE is a safer short term bet than ENJ
1615762609,honestly this is true
1615762609,Lookin too weird for me.. think ill just ride the piddly btc gains haha
1615762618,I have been going for safe plays lately
1615762636,3-5% gains amplifying it by 10 to make 30-50% profit
1615762644,its so much easier to not have red positions that way
1615762695,So how would one learn to not have red positions? 😆
1615762700,ive been thinking of the same thing
1615762715,also why i wish binance would let you tp with %
1615762784,I personally have been going off a 6 hour strategy. Ill look at the last 6 hours on an hour graph and I will aim to buy pretty close to the low end of the 6 hours and I will sell close but not exactly at the high end of that 6 hours
1615762797,Iv only had one position this weekend that was red and I was able to cut my losses to 20$
1615762829,its time to see how much money i have for crypto this well
1615762831,week
1615762834,asx opening
1615762837,:kekw: yolo.
1615762850,You are going to miss out on profits using this strategy unfortunately. My TP for ENJ last night was 2.1 and I missed out on the 2.2-2.4 profits but its much safer and much less red positions
1615762853,"Thank you, I have to try that tomorrow"
1615762866,it seems better than what im doing
1615762869,Mine too
1615762888,I think I gotta write a trailing take profit bot for FAPI
1615762902,"Actually when I woke up this morning ENJ was so low, I added 100€ to my account to move the liq point to a more comfortable distance"
1615762923,Honestly 10x has been the perfect number for me lately
1615762934,"honestly, i really wanna try a strategy where you use really high margin (50x+) and the bot takes profit within 5-10% and cuts losses at 2%"
1615762939,Especially buying at the bottom of those candles
1615762961,at 50X 2% drop would be liquidation
1615762972,you are missing what i mean
1615762980,2% drop in ur position
1615762981,I think they meant -2% PNL not -2% overall
1615762983,not of the coin
1615762999,you dont get fees if you lose right? it could be a decent idea
1615763001,Heres my opinion on that strat: You may get fucked by fees doing it
1615763018,You do get fees if you lose by selling. you just dont get funding fees
1615763044,and funding fees are only once every 8 hours which most 50x positions dont make it to
1615763114,"You pay fees on selling the leveraged position so the higher the leverage, the more fees you pay which is why taking very little profit at high leverage is not advisable"
1615763171,A bot COULD help you minimize your losses but a stop loss that you set up when making the position will do the same thing
1615763198,"A bot would just be more precise when coming to percentages as the TP/SL is off of price, not percentage PNL"
1615763220,"the problem ive ran into with trying to do that manually, is that by the time you can figure out the stop loss price, price has already moved too much"
1615763287,Eh it depends on how much room you are aiming for but yes this is true for higher leveraged positions. with 10x I am aiming for a much higher TP and a much lower SL than with 50x so the movement doesnt affect me as much
1615763296,very true
1615763323,interesting pick @felguerr
1615763335,If you want to go for more precise TP/SL with high leverage then ya a bot sounds good
1615763347,It just sounds like a far riskier strat than what I would go for
1615763365,"the other side of it is that i have very high ping, so i cant market sell or buy with nearly the reliability id like"
1615763390,"When going for high leverage positions, lowering the risk by creating smaller TP/SL negates the reason to do high leveraged positions in the first place"
1615763431,So IMO I think it will have a lower success rate than just lowering your leverage but I could be wrong. Its not hard to try it out with like 30$ or so and see if it works for you 😄
1615763445,actually that makes alot of sense
1615763458,didnt think about it that way
1615763522,"If you want to try out new strats, I def recommending going for it though. It is immensely more helpful to actually put a strat into action using pocket change then it is to theory craft with no real data. I think its very educational to try new strats out to see what works best for you 😄"
1615763550,I only recently figured out my current strat and it was by accident
1615763554,"yea id love to, but as you said, would be far easier with a bot"
1615763560,im gonna try ur one out also
1615763565,soon actually
1615763589,as soon as SUN looks good for a buy in again so i can repay
1615763666,I really need to clean my apartment and I have already more than 2xed my daily goal for the day so I am going to take off but my DMs are always open if you need a second opinion on futures ideas 🙂
1615763756,does anyone actually does that? :p
1615763796,it can be possibly tweeked to be at zero risk and get out with some net profit
1615763799,idk
1615763806,@raven 🥚 @Jeremyfto i've started yo use that exact system
1615763809,you can actually do a similar thing to hedge losses
1615763829,sorry what system 😫
1615763851,"you take a position short or long, and then do the same position in the opposite direction but with 40% or something of the initial amount, that way in the case of a loss its less painful"
1615763852,I use Bybit exchange and push Alertaron code on an aggressive order to get a limit in
1615763861,and out
1615763872,looks like this in code
1615763902,wait up
1615763905,"#bot
ByBitBot(BTCUSD) {
    aggressive(side=sell, amount=1000,slippageLimit=20);
    limit(side=buy, amount=1000, offset=e0.1%, reduceOnly=true);
}"
1615764026,cant load an image here - im new - is that part of settings on site restrictions?
1615764041,ALICE launching tonight on binance
1615764105,its not tradeable before anywhere
1615764167,so i look for a Breakout Score using scripts from WTFutures - jump on the moves that the scripts give as buys and only look to make $50-$150 per scalp - plus the fees i get paid on limits - works pretty well
1615764332,ENJ still down.
1615764776,Im gonna short it for a bit
1615764781,I found I’m only good at high leverage quick positions which makes no sense
1615764784,prob aim for like 50$ prof before jumping out
1615764810,I like quick positions but I dont like high leverage. Too much risk involved
1615764826,10x is my favorite leverage position and I aim for 3-5% movement using it
1615764830,By high I mean 40x idk what you define as high
1615764832,its much more consistant
1615764840,What coins normally do you look at
1615764889,All coins but I focus on coins that are pretty stalled most of the time
1615764902,"When I can see 6 hour candles near eachother, its pretty safe"
1615764915,"one thing lads one friend is asking me how much I could make mining with a GTX1070, anybody knows anything about this? I have no damn clue about mining productivity hahaah"
1615764963,Not much anymore tbh. It normally takes at least a 20 gen GPU to balance out electricity cost
1615764985,youd prob lose money on mining with a 1070 NGL
1615765012,yeah what i was wondering
1615765066,used my ENJ profits to buy more CHSB :goldchadcoin:
1615765067,also this ENJ short might have been a dangerous idea
1615765075,mhm
1615765080,I may still make profits but we'll see
1615765094,I was planning to long it at that breef 2.41 but urgh
1615765097,*brief
1615765106,missed it
1615765113,Only shorting with 250 rn and I'll get out at -30% if needed
1615765194,im longing 10x since 2.27
1615765195,LMAO
1615765229,Ill get out at 2.51 if we get that high
1615765230,wish binance would just tell you liquidation point at the order book
1615765237,hey guys is there a reason i can't load a chart image here?
1615765242,You can use the calculator
1615765249,because it just seem to allow me
1615765314,rank?
1615765322,@That one belgian super cunt yeah that sucks in Binance - I use Bybit to mainly trade BTC and ETH
1615765339,@Blackhartd maybe hey
1615765355,how come you are a peasant now?
1615765392,its her alt
1615765401,ew
1615765435,tried it but it doesn't spit out an answer. weird
1615765483,thats super weird. Its worked for me in the past
1615765518,I no longer worry too much about it now that im 10xing. Its just Entry-Entry/10
1615765569,and dividing by 10 is easy. just move the decimal over one
1615765597,sure there is maint cost that is added to it but its never a huge amount for it to actually matter to me
1615765632,also ENJ is slipping again
1615765638,come to papa. Bring me the money
1615765642,mhm I am eyeballing it
1615765667,my TP is 2.39
1615765683,so close
1615765734,its such a multipurpose coin. Iv had 4 longs and 2 shorts on it in the last 2 days
1615765841,wanted to buy ENJ under 2 and the time never came 😢
1615765894,waiting for my entry i saw it pump to 2.50 last night lol. big L
1615765897,I bought AT 2 yesterday
1615765945,OOooo ADA is getting low
1615765968,:kekw: down 11% on ada
1615766020,Short enjin too much and the wall just eats away and you will not catch her
1615766039,aaand jeremy's TP got hit
1615766039,She has to go down to go up twice as fast
1615766046,Yep +80$
1615766052,not bad for an after shower short
1615766052,EZ
1615766086,anyone here bullish on bnb?
1615766095,I am for long term
1615766097,volume metrics are insane and getting more insane by the day...
1615766102,Im not going to but I soooooo want to short more
1615766113,its so inticing but way outside my acceptable risk
1615766146,Coinbase has an IPO valuation of $100billion. Binance has 10X the daily volume as coinbase yet only has a $50bil market cap.
1615766172,"regulatory FUD is holding bnb back, but if they quash the recent CFTC investigation that will be insanely bullish"
1615766652,urgh btc
1615766832,Ok what to buy now
1615766840,We retested 58.700
1615766847,Now we should be going up
1615766895,Ohh.. Bitcoin
1615767585,🤣
1615767606,i missed the dip again
1615767608,fuck my life

1615767623,were u trying to buy btc?

1615767635,i coulda long it
1615767636,limit buys man
1615767637,so easy..
1615767679,here is the trade of year

1615768904,or 0
1615769101,did you got out lad
1615769116,no his TP was 2.39
1615769120,I got out with profits. IT hit my TP
1615769130,oh im kinda away from pc those last days
1615769140,since the ETH disappointment
1615769154,didnt read it
1615769164,No worries ya now I am working with an ADA and a doge long
1615769181,aiming for 100$ prof a peace and I got in low enough that its def pretty likely
1615769250,getting out at 1.085 for ada and 0.061 for DOGE with entries at 1.05 and 0.0586
1615769295,will likely hit my TPs before bed time which will mean today was around 600$ prof day
1615769296,anyone know how to join a pool
1615769299,shit seems like the wave
1615769313,like a mining pool?
1615769317,yea
1615769331,You think DOGE will go to 0.061 tonight? 🤔
1615769341,you just connect to a pool using its url and your wallet address
1615769349,how i get a url
1615769360,you find the pool you want to mine on. what are you trying to mine?
1615769368,can we dm cuh
1615769387,im mad new just tryna learn this shit seems very intresting
1615769402,yep! it was at 0.061 8 hours ago
1615769418,Sure
1615769438,"😮 I might join you on the future, set a TP and go to bloody bed lol"
1615769653,im going to bed. not going to bother on a ENJ position for the night. ADA needs to be aliiiive.
1615769984,DOGE
1615771197,How good is HBAR!!!
1615771689,I have almost 100k doge with leverage lol
1615771876,what
1615771881,seriously you going into doge
1615771951,He likely bought when it was cheap as chips
1615771955,yes primarily because I got in when it was really low and am getting out at a point that it hit TODAY
1615771963,He saw 0.061 pre btc mini crash
1615771990,It was actually 0.064 pre btc crash. 61 is being modest
1615771994,that way I actually hit it
1615772027,Man the binance app really sucks for futures. Minimize it and it gives network error when you pop the app open
1615772049,ya the app is terrible. I do no trading on the app. I only adjust TP/SL
1615772065,If im going to make a futures trade i get my laptop out
1615772091,I am going to trust in daz's bull call for when the japanese market open.
1615772166,Research and buying good coins and all is great. But man FUTURES ARE FUN AF. The tension and the adrenaline are great.
1615772211,Honestly even shit coins like Doge are great for day trading with futures
1615772249,uh
1615772279,
1615772299,Looking very good there dazz. I’m hoping HBAR follows it
1615772316,I set my profit stop at 3 bucks. I pray it hits it.
1615772342,too low $12+ sell wall appeared hours ago
1615772354,I wish binand supported trailing profits
1615772357,wtf he's right
1615772366,"bunch of 10, 12 dollar sell walls"
1615772368,big ones too
1615772369,wtf
1615772373,What you mean?
1615772390,
1615772415,You predictinf even higher today? I cant read those charts.
1615772422,Back at $8 now
1615772449,Next few days $8
1615772481,Daz this is time I am going to take your call. Ignore my past with you. You state that 3 bucks is set too low?
1615772513,are you in futures or just a tp
1615772535,Futures
1615772546,
1615772555,I don't deal in futures but have been right all along so far
1615772562,Entry point.liquidation is ar 2.2
1615772570,now the growth has caught up to my charts
1615772602,in 6 days the 24btc prize starts
1615772619,I say but not confirmed at all
1615772640,"So what would you do in this situation. Keep the 3 dollar stop or higher or go yolo and have no stop loss at all. 

I will trust in your enj TA"
1615772648,this year they will give away a BMW and a dream home
1615772679,i haven't had a stop loss on any of my coins for 10 days plus
1615772722,even when my other coins are down enjin keeps my pf up
1615772741,Well i expect if it hits three it will reject and then either go back to previous support
1615772754,But who the japanese might go absolutely insane
1615772778,everyone with alerts set will start shitting it and fomo it too the moon
1615772808,look at the charts from gmo japan
1615772890,"Thing with Japan, they never make a bad investment really they research and invest in winners"
1615772911,True
1615772913,look at the interest rate on 1k enj compared to 3k btc
1615772921,I know
1615772938,sign me up lol
1615772977,I am going to do either 4 dollar stop or take it to the nedt level and let jesus take the weel with no stop
1615773053,work out the conversion rate of yen to usd and do 50%-65% of what they're offering
1615773079,on the 6 month chart you will retire a whale
1615773111,wouldn't even need a large stake with the odds it would give you
1615773186,"all that's left now is for ea, rockstar or cdprojekt to jump onboard"
1615773213,fomo kicks in for game designers then

1615774135,unfi? uni did you mean
1615774137,anyone know much about futures?
1615774140,I only spot trade
1615774143,idk if I want to get into it

1615775948,Good day at work
1615776157,gg dude
1615776181,what website is that ?
1615776209,coincodex
1615776220,bcdcdaz what program is that with the 24 hr PnL?
1615776263,@felixthechat
1615776294,"Ah, coincodex.  Is that the exchange you use?"
1615776307,Anyone else's thoughts on ENJ?
1615776314,no just to manage my pf
1615776320,"Ah cool,"
1615776335,I have been looking for something like that
1615776337,i use crypto .com
1615776374,ty
1615776396,eveybody on the server is shilling ENJ
1615776399,and SLP
1615776508,Bet they said that about fb and apple
1615776510,I'm not shilling for ENJ
1615776517,Get around HBAR lads
1615776521,I'm just curious about people's predictions
1615776543,ADA probably gonna go up if news from the African Blockchain conference is positive
1615776553,Might see hype before Hoskinson talks
1615776566,Conference is on the 18-19th of March
1615776611,"Yeah. It's not that risky, if you manage your risk accordingly."
1615776671,
1615777125,ADA only has 700 more results
1615778331,The difference is the amount of people talking about ada compared to enj
1615778356,And have been talking about it for much longer too
1615778373,The concentration in the past 3 weeks for the other has been high
1615778415,"speaking of ada, its going snail speed right now. I just wanted 100$ and its taking its sweet time getting there"
1615778436,im at 50$ PNL rn with 15x and I made that position like 4 hours ago
1615778448,https://tenor.com/view/monsters-university-snail-going-on-my-way-omw-gif-5461800
1615778483,its a 500$ position too. its likely going to be one that hits in my sleep
1615778503,my 400$ doge is gaining faster than ada 🙄
1615779776,@bcdcdaz good call
1615779801,it is
1615779805,I should of sold at 1.48
1615779822,I just wanted to make a quick buck but im in it for long term now i guess.
1615779906,My TP is 1.085
1615779945,I bought in at 1.06
1615779959,so im back where I started
1615779990,Thanks
1615780010,Don't forget me when everyone is rich lol
1615780081,Have you staked?
1615780091,im spot trading
1615780093,I dont do futures
1615780097,No point owning ADA if you aren’t staking
1615780100,Im 20xing 150$ on ENJ for the 3$ push and we'll see what I do after there. Not sure if I want to TP it there or not
1615780102,huh?
1615780105,Not the sort of coin that’s going to moon
1615780115,I wouldnt say that
1615780115,Not true. With Leverage you can make a bit
1615780133,Cardano does a lot of research and the technology itself is super useful
1615780134,its technically owning even though its linked to the position
1615780155,@Jeremyfto whats a good entry position for enj
1615780163,ive been reading the chats and everyones shilling it
1615780188,"I entered quite late sadly, so I only made a small bag, but regardless, good job. you should get into futures trading"
1615780192,Idk tbh. Its been skyrocketing so its kinda an unstable callout
1615780206,"yeah thats what I thought, I didnt want to buy in just for it to crash"
1615780207,getting in right now is risking the chance that it topples over
1615780209,"I’m aware of the product, I own a lot of it, but in terms of jumping on for quick bucks it’s not a great short term thing.
I’m not experienced with the futures/leveraging side of things so Jeremy knows what’s up there"
1615780241,With calls like this I might do
1615780248,Its great for short term leverage trading because of how slow it is
1615780262,you dont want to do very volatile coins with leverage because you can get liquidated
1615780278,"but I totally agree, spot trading it is not the way to go for short term profits"
1615780357,Its really the way to go to make real money. I withdrew all but about 400$ on friday and am already back up to 1k
1615780381,I’m spewing because ENJ rises coincided with me paying a lot of bills so didn’t have any money to move around
1615780390,So last fortnight has been painful
1615780411,These results may vary though. I have been doing futures for a bit and am good at judging what to do with leveraged positions(unless I am hammered)
1615780459,"yeah but my way I've been in enjin since 28th feb not left once only added, I'm seeing 100%+ a day now"
1615780476,minimum
1615780489,Price must have been around 30-40c
1615780493,When you bought in
1615780518,and with those results you could have 10xed leveraged them and made 1000%+ a day
1615780528,I will speak to you more though as I've heard great things about you
1615780595,I will be very soon but 10000% with the coins I have
1615780631,
1615780693,I grabbed stc at 0.011332 or something
1615780733,100% for every 0.011332 increase
1615780748,Im very interested to see how well CRO goes. Tbh its directly linked to how well crypto.com does because the main reason to have it is to stake it for their rewards debit card
1615780776,so its going to be interesting on if Crypto.com is able to expand enough to make their coin blow up
1615780776,crypto have a very bright future
1615780807,f1 starts soon along with advertising
1615780808,yes but that doesnt necessarily mean that that company does. I like them tbh. Just hope others feel the same way so they can stay open
1615780866,when they go mainnet and fork to cro.org chain or whatever it is lol
1615780884,chz is squeezing
1615780891,anyone in favor of entering rn?
1615780908,"if it booms, it's bound to be explosive"
1615780910,check 1h
1615780946,chz if you hold doesn't matter on price next 2 weeks it goes bang
1615780974,yeah good point
1615780981,I was mostly wondering shorter time
1615780991,first fully defi exchange
1615781019,for futures
1615781039,visas already out hodl cro and spend on the visa and get free cro
1615781056,"right as I say it, it looks like it may be trying smth here"
1615781063,I hope
1615781065,CHZ has been following ENJ I’ve noticed
1615781072,Usually 12-24hrs after
1615781084,It's made with  enjin coins
1615781369,chz doing smth
1615781389,volume not most promising
1615781468,rejected by 0.68 5 times in the last 5-6h
1615781475,hmm
1615781919,Hot buy and hold still long way to go.. told ya yesterday.
1615781930,looks like that call was on point
1615782841,btc sending everything down
1615782847,let's see where it all lands
1615783398,i think we're good
1615783740,nop we're not
1615783877,man btc is a bitch
1615783908,ikr
1615783971,took away all my ada profits and halfed my doge profits
1615783978,what a douchebag coin
1615784002,BTC needs to stay in its own lane and leave my alt coins alone
1615784014,https://tenor.com/view/whoop-ass-fight-fighting-can-of-whoop-ass-open-up-a-can-gif-5606197
1615784033,agreed
1615784146,My SL is about to hit on my ENJ
1615784155,https://tenor.com/view/burial-funeral-coffin-rip-casket-gif-17410114
1615784189,its fighting tooth and nail though ill give it that
1615784661,make up your goddamn mind already
1615784663,"Oooooh, nice!
`QKC: New peak at 86 sats! Gained 86.96% from entry @ 46 sats`"
1615784768,fack it I'm entering now
1615784802,"as soon as I say that, btc's green candle dries out"
1615784805,offfff
1615784893,nah man that has to be it from this btc dip
1615784895,i'm going in
1615784899,god help me
1615785021,I swear im never sleeping with a futures position open ever again
1615785026,LMFAO
1615785051,hey you're evened out
1615785059,that's way better than being at a huge loss
1615785067,looks btc might might be reversing now
1615785072,it suffered another dip
1615785074,give it a few
1615785082,Yeah but that sucks x) i was at +30% when i fell asleep
1615785089,right yeah
1615785090,that does blow
1615785110,i think enj is back on the way up now too fyi
1615785117,"again, it all depends on btc"
1615785131,which is still spawning red candles UGH
1615785200,everything going sideways rn is so anxiety inducing
1615785208,"I think im completely ignoring ENJ, i didnt get in before and now i feel like its too late"
1615785218,it dropped quite a bit with btc
1615785225,may not be a bad entry idk
1615785297,"Ill see, maybe play with enj futures when btc reverses"
1615785320,yeah that's the thing
1615785325,I'm trying to catch the bottom
1615785335,"btc reversal may get enj back to where it was, but maybe not anywhere farther"
1615785343,that's the issue
1615785350,"Cant bielive how much it grew tho, first time it was mentionned here it was under 1$ iirc"
1615785362,"if I enter by the time I'm 100% sure btc has reversed, I'll gain nothing on any other reversal, they're following btc live"
1615785367,gotta risk it and predict the bottom
1615785379,suffer smaller losses along the way if it drops a bit more
1615785389,but in order to get a much bigger win at the end
1615785394,it's risky af
1615785402,ikr
1615785434,"18,000 btc inflow to Gemini, decent btc pullback will come in the short term"
1615785492,"Well thats what futures trading is about lol, its hard tho. Always make sure you have enough margin si you can take a few %s losses without being liquidated"
1615785505,absolutely
1615785511,that's #1 priority first
1615785564,Alright
1615785571,In
1615785589,Now im just praying lol
1615785612,good shit
1615785635,expected retest of 2.80 and possible denial
1615785641,so I'd look to cash out there
1615785675,"Thx for the info haha, idk much about enj so any advice is good :)"
1615785693,https://twitter.com/travalacom/status/1371008197801164800
1615785766,Ooh thats good news :)

1615786021,BTC dont do this to me
1615786024,Please
1615786039,it has no chill
1615786086,"Fuck it im holding, it'll bounce back up"
1615786112,"hold btc, hold it there"
1615786191,Futures make me look at 1m charts even if i know thats stupid lmao
1615786228,yeah that shit gonna take away years of your life
1615786233,at least do 5m
1615786304,Thats so true lmao
1615786323,unless you 125x
1615786324,Even 5 min dont really make sense imo tho
1615786331,then don't blink
1615786380,"Never x125 lol, maybe after a huge price mouvement you can x125 in the other direction for a few minutes but thats all"
1615786400,"""few minutes"""
1615786401,lmao
1615786405,like 5 seconds
1615786422,@NOVA excuse me sir who are you?
1615786452,Yeah maybe a few minutes was a little optimistic lol
1615786675,bro btc
1615786700,what the actual shit
1615786719,You know im never listening to you ever again right?
1615786745,ALICE/BTC coming soon
1615786752,

1615786780,u enter a long pos with leverage right after i post this?
1615786784,lmaoooo we're in the shit together
1615786793,"but seriously, btc was looking okay"
1615786818,@reqularhd right before actually x)
1615786826,yea
1615786827,same
1615786830,oh shoot sorry man lol
1615786854,30x leverage is scary tho
1615786876,I wouldn't try to gamble so much in a questionable situation like this
1615786882,especially when btc was going sideways
1615786908,enj is holding strong tho
1615786914,it didn't follow that last dip
1615786949,i hope you didn't exit that position yet
1615786952,"True its not a lot of money tho, and i expected to close my position quicker x) think im going to set tp and sl and going to take a shower and we'll see lol"
1615786961,"Not yet, i almost did tho x)"
1615786969,bet
1615786974,"aight, we'll see"
1615787020,omg
1615787072,ada is starting to look tasty again
1615787075,might dip into it
1615787116,enj surprisingly holding its green candle when btc had yet another dip. looking good so far
1615787118,You know my ENJ went to the depths of hell almost hitting my TP and then said nope
1615787122,Im real surpirsed
1615787124,ada has suffered a lot tho...
1615787131,ada used to counter-btc's movement
1615787137,"but as of lately, it's been following it"
1615787144,Just wait on the news she’ll be right
1615787155,"I dont think ada is going under 1$ tho, now might be a good time to buy"
1615787156,Got 3-4 days til Charles speaks
1615787170,indeed
1615787213,Im gonna be real surprised if my enj survives the night
1615787241,Oh im gonna be surprised if mine survives 5 more minutes lmao
1615787252,what lev u going off of?
1615787271,the maniac went 30x
1615787285,thats rough. I went 20x
1615787286,😅
1615787294,my SL is at 2.6
1615787297,"I'm only 10x, I'm a bit of a puss"
1615787302,"Its 40$ tho, i dont care that much"
1615787303,:kekw:
1615787318,mines 300$
1615787326,$560 here
1615787359,"My sl is 2.62 but i might as well let it getting liquidated, idk, liq price is 2.59"
1615787360,"who knows, maybe my stim check will hit soon"
1615787378,its suppose to hit today. Maybe it will come with a cape to save my position
1615787408,"my liq is also 2.59 but if I liq, my doge profits wont balance out the loss"
1615787419,jesus
1615787420,so my SL is 2.6
1615787436,2.60 might hold well tho
1615787449,AND IF BTC WOULD CALM THE F DOWN
1615787464,Oh well
1615787466,here it goes again
1615787476,Didnt have the time to change my sl x)

1615787998,shitty ass dick

1615788251,it fucked off
1615788263,Good movie you’re referencing there
1615788265,I still have 2 stable positions to even out the risky one
1615788275,"gotcha, that's good then"
1615788285,but... but @Nova 😦
1615788299,I feel so bad for the dude
1615788318,"he entered with me and then we were hit by btc, but I was pretty sure in staying around 2.60"
1615788334,until I realized he was 30x
1615788366,ENJ from 2.58 to 2.64 in no time
1615788372,So much volume
1615788375,"dont short rn, the strat is to see a confirmed downtrend and buy at the high of the downtrend"
1615788377,I have a 0.66$ enj position at 50x
1615788381,lol
1615788387,you go 0.66$
1615788390,make me money
1615788392,"Dont lmao, i lost 30$ 😂"
1615788412,yeh thank fuck it wasn't more
1615788415,if ENJ hits 3$ my 0.66 makes me 4$ lol
1615788419,wtf
1615788425,Yewww
1615788433,ill buy a candy bar with the profits
1615788435,did you open that one when they added enj to futures or smth?
1615788448,Oh no I just now opened it
1615788452,I put 0.66$ in
1615788455,I wouldnt put more on a coin i barely know anything about and i havent been monitoring at all before
1615788465,I’m not into doing things I don’t really understand. Bad enough putting money in coins that I don’t research a lot haha
1615788468,"ooh sorry, I thought you opened it when enj was at 0.66 - lmfaoooo"
1615788470,its gonna make me 4$. I believe in it
1615788470,imagine tho
1615788473,hahahahha
1615788491,im not even going to S/L bro
1615788494,im that risky
1615788497,dont test me

1615788523,"who cares, send it!!"
1615788536,You won’t send HBAR 50x
1615788543,"enj going for it, even with a slow btc"
1615788554,Iv earned 0.30 on my 0.66 already
1615788567,im rich!!!
1615788575,Imagine you turn that into $50 in a few weeks
1615788576,my enj winnings are being nullified by ada being a cuck
1615788587,Is that a challenge?
1615788588,lol
1615788604,btc still indecisive....
1615788606,fuckkkkkkkkkkk
1615788626,That would be a fun trading challenge. Have a whole bunch of people with like 10$ in futures trying to get to 1k
1615788630,see who gets there first
1615788631,Give it a crack
1615788641,bet
1615788650,Im actually serious. Ill do it
1615788657,It sounds like fun
1615788683,I’ll give you to the end of the month to turn $10 into $200?
1615788690,So just over 2 weeks
1615788698,Easy one to start
1615788718,Oh with 10$ thats easy sauce.
1615788732,reeeee ada whyyy
1615788737,lets get it
1615788739,"If you do it within the week, make it 1k by a month"
1615788746,Or 5 weeks
1615788761,Ill document it and everything. This sounds like fun
1615788772,"Yeah haha, will be a chad challenge"
1615788790,lmao the chad challenge
1615788795,i like it
1615788807,I was trying to turn $50 into $500 but have only made it $71 so far in about 5 days
1615788816,But I’m not as experienced
1615788819,I turned 400$ into a grand over the weekend
1615788832,i dunno what to do
1615788837,this is so fucking crazy
1615788845,Yeah I don’t do enough trading to be getting that kinda profits haha
1615788851,Unless I get lucky with a coin
1615788854,this indecisiveness on btc is awful
1615788866,"I wouldn't mind it going either way, just as long as I know which way bruh"
1615788869,Gooooo HBAR
1615788897,no clear indication of upwards or downwards move
1615788898,ew.
1615789029,Iv gotten my 0.66->1$
1615789035,nice job
1615789038,first steps
1615789137,closed my position
1615789139,gonna wait this out
1615789221,looks to be going down tbh...
1615789253,I got plenty of liq room rn
1615789253,compare the last dip to this one
1615789257,on my two main positions
1615789282,the buyers are really struggling right now
1615789293,"last time, they picked it back up within 30mins"
1615789374,this bound to be bloody innit
1615789406,eh just means sales for me tomorrow 🤷‍♂️
1615789414,tomorrow?
1615789432,ya its 1:23am for me

1615789450,lo
1615789451,RIP 1$
1615789517,lol I got a margin call cause of my 1$ position 5x lol
1615789551,after the position closed my overall margin went back down to like 12% but apparently it launched my margin up first
1615789731,recovery?
1615789735,it's a fat green candle
1615789816,comedic
1615789866,"Disappointing, it was +20k% last time i checked"

1615790102,Thank fuark
1615790104,btc going down
1615790215,"Shit, another lower low.. long term downtrend?"
1615790234,maybe yeah
1615790239,let's see closing candles
1615790248,10-ish minutes
1615790251,another hour candle
1615790255,might just confirm it
1615790283,"sorry, 20ish*"
1615790285,lol wtf
1615790378,Kinda looks like what happened when we hit 50k for the 1st time imo
1615790415,*abandon ship*
1615790472,58k?
1615790483,"Never lol, but maybe its time to switch to short"
1615790525,"Maybe yh, like 1 month ago"
1615790557,enj doesn't give a fuck
1615790562,surprisingly
1615790599,enj would have been at $3 if it wasn't for the btc pullback
1615790653,"Fuck ENJ, im starting to feel like its been designed only to fuck me in particular lol"
1615790676,@Nova feel for ya dude
1615790683,"Good thing i didnt get in, it would never have hit more than 1$"
1615790690,BTC still flowing red on the charts
1615790726,"Yup, you love to see it"
1615790753,the %min looks ugly
1615790758,5min
1615790774,how come i cant post an image here?
1615790780,rank?
1615790837,"Yeah, you need 5 invites"
1615791528,Even my safe trades are fucked
1615791532,
1615791549,Literally bought super fucking low on both
1615791569,Not low enough I guess as BTC decided to lose its cool
1615791592,hour candle incoming
1615791875,hmm

1615792212,Maybe at around 2.5
1615792231,yup there will be a correction
1615792241,"maybe not as big, but it will correct"
1615792250,no way it reaches $3 today
1615792253,with btc dumping this much
1615792268,It could easily go there
1615792364,"fck you're right, look at it go"
1615792370,"$3, then correction I'd assume"
1615792388,"maybe even 2.9, enormous sell wall"

1615793466,Oof
1615793475,"I long'd ada, you're welcome"
1615793480,Eh im fine. My liquidation is at 0.92
1615793486,I hope I made your overall % go up by 0.001%
1615793516,Saddest thing is. I set tp on enj at 3 bucks
1615793521,guys
1615793526,:kekw:
1615793527,I accidentially long'd matic
1615793532,instead of shorting it during the btc fall
1615793536,I'm down $200
1615793546,I only realized too late
1615793550,pls buy matic
1615793553,:kekw:
1615793567,you cunt
1615793570,how did you know
1615793575,or is that your $1 investment?
1615793603,"like srsly, who would have known enj wouldn't fall deep during that btc shortage? it followed it every time in the past except for today. fml"

1615793639,But it will get there
1615793643,lets goooo
1615793651,for sure
1615793661,k matic is coming back phew...
1615793671,Pumped margin in enj. 2.21 is liquidation point. I should he gjcci
1615793674,"I was too used to longing shit, so when I wanted to short it, I pressed long instead"
1615793677,dumb fuck me
1615793695,you're gucci there 100%
1615793745,"first impressions, enj's support might be 2.70-2.80"
1615793752,"obv still too early to call, wait more"
1615793983,"Shorting btc x20, not too confident tho but i feel like it'll keep going down"
1615794004,idk man
1615794149,"ok fk it im in, looking for an entry on enj"
1615794156,also polka just overtook ada 😉
1615794158,"stims are arriving, people will invest"
1615794163,i think btc landed by now
1615794186,Also not sure about this idea
1615794286,"really wish I picked up chz, 0.60 has been support for a while"
1615794291,was today as well
1615794330,the fact that enj is valued less than chz is what makes me enj bullish
1615794348,true
1615794468,enj huge buy wall at 2.70
1615794478,What happenwd with CHR
1615794485,The bull run ended
1615794492,btc had a drop
1615794499,chr was no exception
1615794519,its graph is identical to many other altcoins
1615794522,as well as btc's
1615794540,I thought btc goes down alts go up
1615794547,na
1615794560,"Btc moves, alt go down"
1615794569,"Either way, up or down :p"
1615794799,I really want to get in
1615794812,It has a 200m market cap
1615794835,It can double on a good day
1615794950,I got so lucky that a sell order got triggered yesterday damn
1615794956,grabbed enj at 2.65
1615794960,saved me 1k
1615794965,2.68*
1615794979,shouldn't go lower :/
1615794998,I think 2.7 is good support line
1615795058,it could be a crazy day if btc drops more
1615795073,can we see $45k btc
1615795082,not today lol
1615795098,multiple supports have to break for that
1615795110,Probably today best not to look a the blood bath. Avoids panic sale and later regrets 💆🏻‍♂️
1615795179,only down 700 so far
1615795183,could be worse :p
1615795259,@DHeugene start in #📈trading-101  and #🔤crypto-101 and pop back after you've read those 😉
1615795321,"Might happen in a few days tho if bearish trend is confirmed. I dont think thats likely tho,"
1615795328,I grabbed 1 flow at £26
1615795341,nah not while the stimulus is getting sent out
1615795344,maybe after that
1615795348,btc will pump a bit for sure
1615795354,Im taking profits on my short order at 55k
1615795435,And what you going to do with 1 tlow ?:)
1615795452,ride it
1615795469,or go with it 🧐
1615795523,BTC 45k would definitely mean the bull run is over tho
1615795559,It’s a coin 🪙 I assume lol let me get 1 too. If dazz go it. 🙂
1615795665,Can’t get flow on cro or binance. Oh well 🙂 will enjoy my red day lol
1615795723,we are bouncing back
1615795731,lets go for a break even day
1615795761,that would already be a success
1615795772,Yes bounce back to 2.95 enj :kekw:
1615795773,I can't believe I pressed the wrong button on matic
1615795779,"waiting for it to recover, so far so good"
1615795816,ok my first sales order is hit
1615795820,lowering the risk 😂
1615795826,lol
1615795871,my coin dropped 10% lower in 15 min
1615795884,if it does it again I am ready now :p
1615796204,Does anyone know anything about Holo (HOT)?
1615796212,"Is it a pump and dump,"
1615796218,Or is it legit?
1615796234,probably a pump
1615796265,And dump 🤣
1615796270,@TheOne A lot as I add to the bag haha
1615796289,Lets goooo. 220 bucks profit so far.
1615796298,$270 12 month prediction

1615796391,How does your position look today?
1615796423,Oh I see Flow on cripto.com
1615796437,Pretty solid. Didnt hit my TP of 3 dollars but its solid AF. Might get rid of the TP and see where it goes today
1615796482,That's where I got mine
1615796539,no futures on FET 😦
1615796542,lame
1615796546,This is almost fucked again
1615796571,it will be stable retract a little bit the next days no?
1615796575,Evey chart I make is such an underestimate
1615796594,it has to consolidate at somepoint you'd think?
1615796613,"Not with the announcements no, this still is not full on Enjin fomo"
1615796650,I see
1615796653,Who got ALICE
1615796657,I slept damn
1615796667,not gonna buy a coin that is +16000%
1615796680,lmao
1615796684,not in that kind off a mood today 😂
1615796715,Imagine you got in at .1 and put $10 in lmao
1615796813,+25000% now mkay 😂
1615796842,need a bot that buys new listings
1615796846,20ms after htey're listed
1615796895,I think you are better off buying them when they are announced to list?
1615796905,thats also true
1615796910,i dunno if that applied to alice tho
1615796952,it was already 16 dollars on other exchanged
1615796954,Algo 👀
1615797007,nm its a new coin :p
1615797119,Alice just ate a big wall
1615797125,Was Alice available as a ico?
1615797141,Don’t know
1615797144,Damn that would be some real profit
1615797147,But looks promising
1615797216,Where?
1615797229,I couldnt find it any where
1615797283,"@kittiewitty I can't even give Enjin a top market cap, all coins are in circulation and supply can only decrease, they are pushing $4 billion this cycle tho"
1615797284,no I was wrong sorry
1615797293,did it seriously get listed on binace at 10 cents tho?
1615797305,that was just the first order
1615797313,I think at 16 dollar
1615797325,that the lowest price I can see on the other charts
1615797331,first minute trading is so risky bc of that.
1615797337,What's going on with HOT?
1615797348,HOLO is the name
1615797357,"someone would have put a buy order within the first second at that price, first to market sell would sell for that"
1615797363,It has been top gainer on binance
1615797373,also i juuuuust missed out on algo top im so sad
1615797379,some guy was shilling HOT here yesterday
1615797384,and I just ignored him
1615797386,😦
1615797386,i was gonna short it
1615797401,so many coins get mentioned in this disc every day

1615797890,people selling
1615797893,Its going to dump a bit so u gotta sell
1615797903,I think base price will be 12 to 17$

1615797917,No facts backed by that
1615797928,Yeah but now there’s crazy fomo

1615797947,Still pumping
1615797950,You might as well jump in
1615797956,nope too late
1615797977,if you gonna jump in wait for retrace then look at the volume
1615797985,Yeah it would be really risky
1615798027,"i personally dont enter into new drops for this reason, if I cant risk manage properly i wont do it."
1615798035,id rather make $1k a week than risk this shit.

1615798119,"@Sausage Destroyer What about RUNE? Do you have an estimate how far it will go down? Do you think the downtrend will be (temporarily) broken later today, if the market as a whole goes up?"
1615798131,Its easy to get a nice 10% from it rn

1615798973,"DYOR & Im not a FINANCIAL advisor but, XRP is a solid go, look at the info the other post grad posted in the podium. It's got good foundations. If I ever kept a HODL bag it would be in it."
1615798979,While i was typing
1615799006,How much is it rn?
1615799014,Aight I’ll keep hodling
1615799067,"Is it worth longing ADA? Check the 15m chart, looks promising? 😮"

1615799348,I’m looking at mana since it made me great profits
1615799368,Been swinging a lot in the 1 to 1.15 area
1615799388,I would consider going in if it breaks under 1$
1615799393,Not financial advice
1615799395,I wouldnt long anything seeing how the market looks like rn tbh
1615799410,Yeah ada always looks like a good buy
1615799414,Yeah what has happened to it? It’s a bit depressing 😂

1615799478,Jeez:p
1615799483,"I did grab some ada at 1.02 tho, but thats for long term, im not really playing with futures rn, just shorting btc"
1615799499,Yeah it’s a good buy if u plan on holding
1615799550,What's going on with Alice?
1615799569,"Just got listed, it always does this that normal"
1615799593,I started holding at 1.05 me
1615799606,"poor boy that sold at 0,01"
1615799635,Btc wants to test support again
1615799652,Is it a good idea to buy Alice now?
1615799687,How lucky are you in gambling?

1615799829,"thats a falling pennant its doing, if it ever comes back up, and no idea if it will anytime soon, you will be waiting a long ass time"
1615799831,"bud if a coin gets list either you get in the train 0,1 s it gets listed and a small amount either you wait till test a price"
1615799845,Ada making me suicidal

1615800550,buy high sell low thats the way @felixthechat
1615800553,If ada goes to .65 i’m committing suicide

1615800565,Cause there’s just no fuckin way
1615800568,It does that
1615800575,ADA could easily go to 0.65
1615800576,everythings on sale today bois
1615800579,Plot twist. Btc is crashing because everybody is buying alice
1615800582,:kekw:

1615800637,enj gonna be testing $3 at least one more time IMO
1615800645,you think i earn that much? damn
1615800654,This was yesterday

1615800661,Ooh alright
1615800689,All my coins other than reef are down 🥴
1615800691,Btc will settle around 54k before consolidating and going up again imo. The bull market isnt over

1615800847,what price did you buy at and what price did you sell at?
1615800851,Do you guys hold spot or just trade futures?
1615800866,he bought at like 40
1615800873,sold at 28ish lol
1615800880,"Felt it haha. The 20 days moving average is still way under current price and 60k probably is a huge psycological barrier for new buyers, it was pretty much doomed to drop hard. But dont worry its not over it'll definitely go back up"
1615800900,wow. then it dipped to 27 and risen to 33.8
1615800919,did you close the short or still waiting?
1615800924,Can it take weeks for alt coins to recover from this?
1615800929,no
1615800941,"for what its worth, I lost a similar amount on ADA. Don't do anything rash like try to earn it back 'quickly'. Take it as experience and move on"
1615800958,yeah
1615800969,where
1615800983,i called this dump like 3 hours ago lol
1615800991,"i ""lost"" 90% of my profits from those 2 months doing some futures on eth, not trynna get that back"
1615800993,sold half my position then
1615800994,Both
1615801004,"just got a new mic and webcam, and be chilling here watching the game"
1615801004,"I was about to buy Verasity on that post grads call, but then saw markets were taking a turn, and held back. My younger self would have just gone in with a market order. Do a little analysis before pressing buy"
1615801031,opinions on whether 55k is the lowest it goes for now or will it drop more?
1615801045,i was thinking about more lol
1615801048,That’s impossible to predict
1615801056,"just opinions, not predictions"
1615801063,We are at the mercy of the market
1615801083,In my opinion it won’t be a huge drop
1615801085,i say 40-45 within weeks if the run is over
1615801088,at least
1615801092,A good correction helps prolonging the bull market
1615801096,So it’s ok :p
1615801103,"but you know, can't predict it, we had some days we were up 7k"
1615801107,others down 5k
1615801115,i hope it drops more
1615801119,I think we’ll be fine tomorrow or even today
1615801137,this day we got 10k down but kind of recovered most
1615801150,Moved cash to futures wallet. Ready to margin increase ada if needee.

1615801343,and when did you enter?
1615801343,"If you have so much, you should be a whale in a pump and dump"
1615801347,its a reaction of the body panic mode makes you go insane
1615801347,Easy money :p
1615801355,btc & eth
1615801360,what entry
1615801364,DCA?

1615801427,Also no longer breakeven now lol :’)
1615801428,i dont know it is futures that are going to fuck me i have spot btc left to adjust eth sl on futures
1615801439,you’re brave for staying in this long lol hodl!

1615801445,i see
1615801461,Anyone translate
1615801461,with that amount of capital i would highly recommend a subscription to something like cryptoquant
1615801466,only wanted that $2000 retest aaaaa
1615801479,anyone else short btc at the new ath
1615801480,Maybe a giveaway??
1615801495,"tracks net exchange inflows and outflows, it can warn you of short term dumps"
1615801499,another big boom for the enjin train
1615801528,another dude right here @Jeremyfto hahaha
1615801529,ENJ is also dropping a little bit now
1615801536,our fallen brother in arms
1615801539,But I bought the FET dip
1615801546,what price do you need to buy for that
1615801551,"Im not closing, im waiting for my tp at 55k"
1615801577,"$29 usd a month, i just follow random guys on twitter who post those updates for free hahaha"
1615801578,It says something about price
1615801599,"Wont drop much lower than that imo, but yeah, impossible to predict"
1615801609,"but honestly, it helped me sell before the pullback in feb too"
1615801614,If only someone predicted this 👀
1615801618,do they give good info
1615801623,yes
1615801634,it literally tracks inflows to each exchange so you can act before it hits market
1615801639,yes might use it in the future if there is one for me

1615801751,54k
1615801753,atleast funding is lower again
1615801760,And then bounce
1615801767,(Just my opinion)
1615801783,Did somebody say free coins @Alanox
1615801828,Im too cheap so I follow random guys on twitter who have subscriptions and post updates 😆
1615801869,but i would say the full subscription is very helpful if you trade futures w large cap
1615801875,The bounce would be nice round about now 😂
1615802076,I think 50 k is more realistic for the bounce
1615802124,Alright it can bounce back up now i dont care anymore
1615802132,Quick somebody buy enj up to $3 real quick
1615802145,great stuff man!

1615802818,"Did anyone heard about that Alice coin? It was announced 4 hour ago

1615802882,Do we already know about new listings on binance?
1615802885,Whoever bought at 60usdt mustve been punching the air crying
1615802888,Lmfao
1615802892,4 hours ago on binance
1615802905,"well, no ... not everything goes up only ... depends on the leverage and liq price ... 2-3x is pretty safe but don't try more than 10x until you're experienced is my advice"
1615802910,tHIS mf HIT 2.99 while i was asleep 😢
1615802921,or they were trying to pump it
1615802927,I don't know the volume at these levels
1615802931,But will it even go above the 30$ or it would crash!
1615802936,i know but people always think it just keeps going up and it is easy to make money
1615802940,it spiked to $60 in the first minute
1615802946,i wish binance did a 1s chart
1615802954,I think alice will stabalize around 12 to 17$
1615802960,But i got no facts to back that
1615802967,https://twitter.com/dazstoke1978/status/1371403022660669440?s=20
1615802973,its done back to 60k
1615802973,now's the time to come back btc
1615802982,"Thats when trading opened, it was announced way before"
1615802993,what does that color graph even do
1615803033,Wondering whether to re-enter ENJ now if the price could go back up hmm
1615803049,Please share guys gave the discord a good shout too @Alanox
1615803050,still a good time dude
1615803054,but it comes back fast
1615803058,In the worst case scenario you’ll have to wait some time
1615803059,so either now or don't
1615803065,But it’s gonna go up
1615803067,you can see it going right now
1615803074,it's recovering well
1615803092,I’m not expecting a huge drop
1615803093,anything above 2.7 is already a little meh
1615803100,I might be wrong
1615803101,helps me find the support and resistance
1615803102,anything below is a pretty good buy
1615803121,It will exceed 3$ pretty quick
1615803125,Do I sell my reef for ENJ now that’s the question 🤔
1615803133,Depends
1615803141,I have reef and I’m holding it
1615803145,"absolutely, $3 retest happening soon. now whether it will pass it on a second try, idk. maybe. if not, next time"
1615803148,Just a lil bag
1615803156,Yeah I have a v little bag too
1615803162,enj heading back to 2.7 quick

1615803173,$500
1615803179,yessir
1615803190,Everybody sleeping on FET
1615803198,what about FEET
1615803204,@Romeeeo where are you FET buddy
1615803212,"Okay basically I was doing really well the past few months (invested first in January), I was being very conservative and conscientious about my investments, and so I went from initial investment of 8.5k up to 11.5k a few weeks ago, holding ETH and Sushi and UNI and BNB and AAV and 1inch and some ADA.  So anyway there was this big dip across the market a few weeks ago and my portfolio went down to 8.5k, after which it climbed again and then started dipping again, and my plan the entire time had been to sell everything at the top and buy back in lower. So anyway when it was dipping again I just sort of panick sold everything at 9.5k and moved it all into USDT.  I have been waiting for everything to dip again so that I could buy back in at or below the prices that I exited at because the train had moved on and left me at the station.  Well, I should have just waited with my 9.5k of Tether to buy in on this dip.  But basically I just made 2 stupid moves today and yesterday and lost 2.5k 😫  The worst was with Alice, which I just lost 1.5k with in about 30 minutes.  So now my equity is .12 BTC, whereas it was .21 BTC a month ago.  I'm really shaking all over, because I spent months making very calculated moves and holding, only to lose it all in 1 day basically.  I'm 1-1.5k below my initial investment now.  So my question is @Nova how should I approach this?  Is there any way for me to regain that 2.5k?  Or should I just go back to my previous strategy and buy into the coins I held previously in this dip?"
1615803236,2.65 crossed. still time to enter before 2.7

1615803305,only put in money you're willing to lose

1615803395,I'm all in Ada 🤡
1615803421,"i got like 25 euros in my bank, everything is in crypto."
1615803424,I do it with money I’m willing to lose. You’d be mad not to at my age
1615803437,indeed. the market is too volatile and unpredictable to be toying with your savings...
1615803438,my crypto portfolio is only 3% of my bank savings
1615803467,mine's probably about 2%
1615803471,3btc total vs 25 euro in my bank. seems smart.
1615803500,More in crypto than in my bank
1615803506,
1615803514,i've got 10k in my crypto portfolio
1615803518,you can do the maths if you want

1615803580,You're rich too
1615803586,>3btc

1615804457,"I dont see how the ""change leverage"" button works. You press a higher and it changes nothing?"
1615804504,It doesn’t make any difference to your initial investment
1615804520,But will if you add more to your position I believe
1615804548,And it’s some shit like if you started at 10x but add more at 20x then it’ll average at 15x idk
1615804549,Time for btt for a week again 🤔
1615804552,I noticed it did fuck all
1615804647,@bcdcdaz would you suggest I sell my spot ENJ for a long at 10x ;))

1615805312,aenj is what we need the ico for and the golden egg will be lusd
1615805454,It's things like this that show crypto.coms future
1615805522,"will it hit my SL, its close"
1615805528,
1615805592,it did

1615805730,bruh
1615805731,lets go!
1615805747,at what mark will you get !!!!d
1615805762,I have no frickin idea
1615805766,ENJ going berserk and I'm stuck in CHZ 😭
1615805775,when does the first one start
1615805778,is at 1k%?
1615805792,its more just buying into any dip with leverage :p
1615805796,Not now at least
1615805848,Wait is enj already listed on Huobi?
1615805863,If not at what time is it happening?
1615805882,"Just went in at 2.75 long, gonna come out at 2.85 I think"
1615805898,9h ago I think
1615805939,"Exactly. I put in buy orders for both ENJ and BTC and only ENJ filled, BTC ran away before it could hit."
1615805947,But I'll take what I can get
1615805966,Trading started 4h ago
1615805970,chz will to Enjin powered
1615805975,Ok thanks
1615806047,can the post grads organise a screen sharing session
1615806055,how to do leverage trading for dummies
1615806074,I dont understand the binance UI 😦
1615806146,Margin or futures?
1615806147,sheesh congrats bro
1615806151,I found futures easier than margin tbh
1615806165,i did pretty well overnight on my btc short aswell
1615806176,actually im a little confused on margin
1615806185,perhaps I have to read more into it first lol
1615806197,"Thanks, baba!
$300 of profit locked in with a stop-loss"
1615806226,oh thats a good idea actually
1615806260,Nice one man
1615806262,"yeah, sure... no need to drop from 400% to 100% or even lower just because you were on the loo or sth"
1615806283,I don't really understand what that means
1615806286,i still havent figured out margin. i understand how to borrow the thing i want to short a coin
1615806287,overnight i made 1.7k on my btc short
1615806295,but thats it
1615806300,is there any advantage to do leverage trading like e.g. 200 dollar with a *50 instead of using 10k?
1615806306,futures seemed easier to learn for me personally
1615806308,than margin
1615806333,if your position gets liquidated youd only lose that 200 instead of all your 10k
1615806344,"Yes. You can do something else with the 9,800"
1615806348,yea but you get liquidated sooner
1615806354,well thats the risk isnt it
1615806361,either lower your leverage or yolo
1615806364,"Chz is funded with enjin coins, when enjin grows chz grows"
1615806368,I don't think they want to go in 10k at 50x leverage 😄
1615806371,
1615806375,Algo going
1615806379,As I understood the 10k would be spot trading
1615806387,yea lol
1615806390,I'm not a mad man 😂
1615806409,trying to retire early...
1615806428,yea but then it douple dips

1615806466,😺
1615806490,Where's that TikTok of the kid crying because he lost his 100k college fund to DOGE on high leverage?!
1615806499,i saw that
1615806508,was that real?
1615806515,looked real
1615806522,ouch. ❗❗❗❗
1615806556,❗❗❗❗
1615806560,why is that a thing
1615806565,"If not, somebody put up $100k just to make a viral video. The loss was real, I think"
1615806571,i heard about that
1615806573,didnt he kill himself
1615806578,they filmed the futures position changing and everything
1615806584,that was a guy that bought GME
1615806587,and had to repay 200k
1615806599,"yah, don't think that was the college kid"
1615806600,luckily binance futures you cant go into debt because of liquidation otherwise youd have a lot of idiots doing the same
1615806610,"ADL queue, your position is soon to be auto-reduced"
1615806629,yea i know what it does
1615806636,i just dont understand why it exists is all;
1615806646,"ok guys, my stop loss just hit ... I'm out 🙂"
1615806652,nice nice
1615806654,nice monies tho
1615806675,now short it with ur profits 🤡

1615807517,Enjin keep pumping it with announcements this is the hottest new craze in Japan
1615807535,They have Enjin for every meal of the day
1615807548,"Does anybody know why I can't borrow more than 2,000 ENJ on 50x leverage? It only lets me bet $100, that's 100%. Any way to increase that? 🙂"
1615807553,12 hrs i say
1615807589,Tbh XSH was super popular in japan too well not ENJ level but it had a strong japanese community. Shit pumped haaaard
1615807598,Do 30-40% for safety
1615807628,if you are right
1615807638,then I am a moron for not buying it
1615807639,😂
1615807644,We went 38% up yesterday
1615807676,30-40% increase would be 300 to 400% increase for me. :kekw: jesus

1615808181,u probs deleted the widget thing
1615808190,is it possible that alice went up 30962.5%?
1615808200,found it
1615808210,yes I think it first sold at like 10 cents.
1615808213,"yes, from the very lowest price of 0.1 😄"
1615808215,Might as well stick with it tho
1615808216,Fuck it
1615808220,its first sale was 178 sats
1615808224,So they majorly pumped and dumped this in japan and we didn't budge
1615808242,"Recommended video by Mo: ""How I lost 17 BTC with trading"" 😄 🙂"
1615808242,so if I understand it right. adding margin doesn't do anything other than lose you more money if you get liquidated?
1615808258,"Exactly, but you get liquidated later"
1615808267,Uhm... and it keeps your position alive in case it goes up again before your new liq price
1615808279,adding margin adds a multiplier to ur profits and losses
1615808299,not really ... maintenance margin doesn't at least
1615808330,true
1615808357,liq at 2.619. now time to pray for jebus

1615808738,hey guys
1615808768,"im new to crypto, due to India announcing they might ban crypto will the dip carry on when all the americans wake up?"
1615808787,so in the net 4/5 hours itll take a bigger dip as the americans are waking up?
1615808817,doubt americans care about not to be rude a country where its pretty much a third world country for nearly all of the citizens
1615808836,true but doesn't it have one of the biggest populations
1615808890,doesn't matter if barely anybody there can invest meaningfully
1615808900,hmm true im new so im sorry if i say anything stupid
1615808922,no biggie
1615808942,Lol. Indias crypto industry is about 13Bil worth. It will make a huge dent.
1615808953,Law is not going to pass tho
1615808960,i heard theyve said this a few times
1615808966,i just wanna buy some BTC
1615808967,Im an indian btw
1615808968,Still a good idea to go into ENJ?
1615808971,i just wanna buy at 50k
1615808979,but i dunno if itll hit 50k
1615808985,the joys of trading aha
1615809031,excited ENJ for now with a 30% profit since Ir ealised I barely put anything in it. so damn stupid that the futures long short is just % ENJ instead of % USDT
1615809045,eyeballing that red candle
1615809078,4H is showing two reds so who knows might drop to 2.6 again
1615809089,It wont
1615809109,never say never.
1615809134,"Will drop only if BTC drop again, which is highly unlikely given the 56K drop already"
1615809142,@Cryptoknight do you think btc will hit 50K?
1615809151,unlikely anytime soon
1615809153,I think so.
1615809164,Should hit 50K anytime last week
1615809165,i dunno wether to hold of buying
1615809173,ahh okok
1615809185,i missed it last week caus i was tied up in work :((
1615809188,Its already 50K bro. Its currently at 56K
1615809196,yeahh but i dunno if itll hit 50k flat
1615809206,or if 56k will be the lowest for a good while
1615809214,im just hoping the americans panic when they wake up
1615809222,and then itll take a bigger dip
1615809225,"Oh. Yeah. Sry, misunderstood. No i dont think its going to 50k again right now atleast. I will fall at some point, but that will be back to the 40's"
1615809234,gotchuu
1615809246,They only panic if they see prices at free fall
1615809256,ohh okok
1615809264,Why sell if it's already leveled?
1615809309,i didnt know if all the new people to cyrtop would panic
1615809312,i guess im reaching
1615809319,ill proabbaly buy if it hits 55k again
1615809345,"You guys will start flaming me on this as well too now, but again, time will tell. 

Pretty sure BTC is currently being manipulated only to control ENJ. This means that BTC wont go beyond 63K now until ENJ has made its way to 3.5-4. Then another major drop in BTC should be expected.

Remember this for when the time comes. 

@bcdcdaz"
1615809429,ok now you are overdoing it. a market like BTC isn't going to be manipulated for a gaming NFT token
1615809457,My thoughts as well until 2 days back. I was wrong
1615809467,all this was monday opens. big institute traders open and there you have it they took profit. some panicked and sold.
1615809473,"""Pretty sure BTC is currently being manipulated only to control ENJ."" wow - what are you smoking and can I have some"
1615809493,also almost at 2.6 :godsgardener:
1615809498,Told you you'll flame. But remember i said this.
1615809514,confirmation bias incoming
1615809554,BTC
1615809570,i want it to drop more dont jinx it please
1615809611,put in a 50x long @ 2.6
1615809615,lets see if it fills

1615810166,LOL it actually filled what
1615810167,already 50% up
1615810275,real question is is 2.6 the bottom
1615810303,Can I ask a dumb question
1615810304,2.64 was the bottom. Now its a guessing game i suppose
1615810313,
1615810323,ouch ... new bottom
1615810340,Eh?
1615810345,If the VET/BTC pair is green does that mean more BTC is moving into VET than VET moving into BTC?
1615810355,2.59?
1615810362,Fuck.
1615810366,No
1615810373,@That one belgian super cunt You still in?
1615810377,that means VET is appreciating more in value than BTC is
1615810382,Great drop
1615810387,"Awesome, thank you."
1615810395,Hope it goes down some more
1615810400,Want to get more enj

1615810423,*as of now*
1615810426,"im actually gonna cancel my stop loss and if i get liquidated i get liquidated, its only 20 usdt in it, so i dont really mind if i lose it"
1615810438,I entered at 2.6 but might exit and do less leverage 50X only allows me to buy like 1801 coins like what 60 bucks worth of
1615810441,Dont start please. Im glad i did what i did. But not happy on how it turned out.
1615810444,id rather bet on the chance it bounces back
1615810451,Idk what you’re talking about
1615810460,You talked me into buying in at $2.00
1615810462,Its ok. Not about you
1615810469,You're welcome. Glad you did
1615810477,Lol wait what happened
1615810481,Now I’m curious
1615810497,I got crypto in at $0.80 maybe
1615810514,Your name is still wrong btw

1615810622,Oh man Enjin went for $3
1615810627,Didn’t make it 😢
1615810639,and that is why i canclled my sl
1615810642,woulda hit it
1615810646,It did on Houbi or whatever that exchange is
1615810647,and i would have felt bad
1615810672,$3.01
1615810699,"We're good thouhg. If anyone is getting worried, this would be the time to buy the dip and sleep like a baby."
1615810728,$2.6 is a dip?
1615810729,Huh
1615810735,MAJOR dip
1615810748,Floor is at 2.65 rn
1615810749,I know I want a small dip to maximize profit on my next bag of enj
1615810794,look at 6hr plus charts only
1615810823,no
1615810837,"Also, dont panic, but you have very little time left."

1615811034,Very little time for what?
1615811045,the moon

1615811686,Good. Better to go in with 50x of $50 than 20x of 100$

1615811900,vet
1615811905,why vet?
1615811908,@bcdcdaz
1615811915,And ENJ is just 12%
1615811917,:kekw:
1615811928,twinsies
1615811930,Yes. THIS is how you do it
1615811935,me
1615811937,But VET has gone up from .02 to .075 in just a month and a half and is a fantastic long term play.
1615811937,
1615811952,my profit at 160% is 150ish
1615811963,"Also, another shout out to @Jeremyfto 
Thanks! Shit is working out great"
1615811982,"So with regards to making a future, when turning the leverage from 20x to 50x, it says ‘please margin your risk accordingly’ is that just saying ‘watch out before you lose your money’?"
1615811985,Try going longer tho. Im looking at 850% when we go back up
1615811990,yep
1615812020,I am not getting out until 3 dollars maybe.
1615812026,"lmfao “what’s so great about vet it’s just 10%”

also at a new ATH but hey whatever. Fuckin maxis man"
1615812037,This is not a closed position?
1615812040,"so if i did this, what would happen exactly"
1615812060,"In case youre liquidated, you lose the 15$"
1615812088,it just changes the liquidation price?
1615812089,Think of it like poker. You're doing raise when adding margin
1615812096,so you know how you put in 20 bucks. the moment you lose 20 bucks you get liquidated. if you put in 15 bucks you get liquidated at 35 bucks
1615812120,so all it does it give it more room for it to fall
1615812125,?
1615812134,Yes. And this is super important
1615812139,Oh hey look VET now at +13%
1615812142,Specially with ENG
1615812158,Does it also increase the amount of ENJ you have or is it JUST for liq price?
1615812159,
1615812169,We catching heat
1615812171,Vs ENJ thats going nuts? Maybe ill come to vet when enj is $10

1615812251,Lol. Sry. Thought we were playing. 13% is great!
1615812255,I’m in VET at .02 so I have a vested interest in it.
1615812274,Thats a pretty darn major vested interest. Lol.
1615812283,I have never played in my life
1615812288,So you're up 150%?
1615812292,Yessir
1615812294,Yes don't sell you will be the whale 1 day
1615812296,Nice!
1615812311,"Not selling until .10, and only some then."
1615812331,Don’t make me regret not putting enough in ENJ
1615812335,tp and reinvest at .10 like you say
1615812351,You can probably keep it even then. But put some in ENJ for sure tho when you can
1615812364,:kekw: never mind 105 now

1615812468,Can someone give me a second opinion on a chart? Isn't on 1h BTC starting to look bullish again?
1615812486,Im in it till atleast $50 or April end (whichever comes later)
1615812508,Jesus fuck you really think $50
1615812508,"Ok, merci, but i feel like its too late for that and i dont wanna fomo and do something dumb, ill stick with ADA for long term"

1615812589,"It never stopped being bullish, its just correcting"
1615812590,VET is used by a ton of folks already
1615812609,God I wish I had any of your optimism with a single coin
1615812619,"Don't you mean, a VETsted interest? 😉"

1615812744,Wtf is that Alice token with 29 000% increase 😂
1615812751,i have some questions about it that i havent been able to find sufficient answers to
1615812754,New listing
1615812766,first sale was ultra cheaaaap
1615812773,"Exactly, you were talking about the wrong coin but the right price 🤣"
1615812778,Damn I need to do a bot to buy new listing 😂
1615812796,you made 15k?
1615812800,nice bro
1615812801,First listing on any exchange ... price went from 0.1 to 60 and back within the first minute until it settled for a regular price
1615812810,Thats actually not dumb
1615812815,Nah bought 15k dent coins hahaha I wish I made £15k
1615812819,"I think he owns 15,000 DENT"
1615812828,"He said Damn, not dumb"
1615812830,I borrowed 250k ^^
1615812831,oooh right
1615812842,I see i really need to finish my current programming project to jump on a crypto bot
1615812853,Given that what about STC when it hits cb then binance a week later?
1615812868,What are your thoughts on DENT within the next few months if you don’t mind me asking?<3
1615812872,Fuck your current programming project. Focus on making money :p
1615812892,Who told you my current project won’t give me money ? 😉
1615812897,if u wanna make a bot dedicated to trading first minute listings
1615812922,automate it and host it in japan as close to the exchanges as you can for that fast pings
1615812942,let it do its thing remotely
1615812950,Is it even in the realms of possibility for Casper or SYL to pull an Alice?
1615812951,I have no frickin idea.
1615812952,Of course ^^
1615812965,Most exchanges now list on the app for 3 days to a week before the exchange
1615812971,"I only follow @felguerr blindly, he's long term on DENT. It's gonna moon"
1615812973,I wish 😂
1615812998,

1615813043,Hope you don't have life savings in this
1615813052,Ofc I don’t hehe
1615813060,What about life savings in ENJ
1615813079,This is the second time I’ve heard about LUKSO...may have to toss something in it.
1615813088,Wont matter. A few ENJ will soon be far far bigger than your lifesavings
1615813089,"Ja, do it!"
1615813101,Well that’s all the DD I need
1615813129,Research completed
1615813197,What if one's life savings are $500 that would have been spent on beer by now had one not come up with the idea of investing in crypto
1615813201,
1615813202,"Still a good time to enter. Before LYX does ""an ALICE"" 😉"
1615813237,THen  you'd be daddy cool
1615813251,Ok I'll tell that to my friend who asked that

1615813482,Tell me about it.. short term wise
1615813484,Downwards
1615813515,WAN WAN

1615813523,
1615813524,If I’m not mistaken
1615813604,LUKSO / LYX(e) is nothing for short term. See https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807387265152057374/820691573992849428
1615813654,Ok thanks
1615813759,"It's just that with so many coins moving ahead feels like betting on a horse with a broken leg, at least for now… But could consider getting back if there are some nice developments unfolding"
1615813790,Now what's this about ENJ
1615813794,Should I buy some
1615813901,Do your own research
1615813936,I like it but it’s up to you jumping in or not

1615814488,ENJ is making me nervous
1615814496,is this the run-up to 3$?
1615814507,It’s the run up to something
1615814513,ADA moving
1615814520,"Will it do a brief dive after hitting 3, or will it just keep going?"
1615814520,"Depending on who you ask, could be the run up to $50,000"
1615814522,could be ripe for shorting very soon
1615814598,wonder what VET is gonna do

1615815233,

1615815245,but its open 😦
1615815261,"Gotta do a futures acct, not a furutes 😄"
1615815267,
1615815304,@bcdcdaz it should look like this
1615815315,Only in English not German ^^
1615815341,@bcdcdaz If you click on the yellow arrows
1615815345,
1615815362,"okay, you got 27.15 now"
1615815371,$80 target no time or stop loss
1615815372,did a 20 X on BNB. liq is 242. unless BTC ABSOLUTELY kills itself I should be gucci
1615815395,"next: Select Isolated or Cross (Isolated, probably) and leverage... it's at 20x rn. You wanna do 20x?"
1615815395,Is that possible
1615815407,$80 as price for ENJ??
1615815413,Are **you** only going to put 27$ in an ENJ future? 👀
1615815431,FAAACKKKK! This is a brilliant idea! Me too!
1615815437,Yes
1615815447,absolute trust in the system for daz. he truly believes in enj getting like 100+ billion market cap
1615815448,But theres one issue with the Daz
1615815450,Going to be rich
1615815454,It's a sensible portion of his whole pf. Not too much risk
1615815461,@bcdcdaz One issue.
1615815466,What
1615815475,"Don't think that's possible, you can only set trade limits at like 10x of current price"
1615815479,Might get liquidated if it falls in the middle. So timing is key
1615815490,you would need to just keep it open and set the TP to $80 when price reaches like $8
1615815498,Thats ok. Dont need to set a TP at all.
1615815513,"Don't forget there ain't any coins to release they're all in circulation, supply can only reduce"
1615815523,"nope, I was wrong"
1615815525,It's possibru
1615815528,Anyone hodling DENT?
1615815537,looking for an entry to get in
1615815540,How are you managing your margin?
1615815561,Like $10 is the main amount and $17 is the margin?
1615815563,
1615815655,"@bcdcdaz Now you wanna keep the ""liquidation price"" in mind. That's the price at which your 27.15 USDT will vanish into thin air."
1615815682,Man imagine if coinbase lists ADA
1615815725,I'm lost lol buy long
1615815737,✋
1615815807,I was putting the lot on
1615815827,That's why I came for help
1615815864,"I entered in at £0.002, £0.0023 and £0.0025 (using GBP sorry, may need to convert) and holding 15k denties:) so it’s really on you, haven’t seen the price go below £0.002 since I got in from Swiss’ call in post grads, and it’s currently down 6% so take a look :p"
1615815872,Keep an eye on ALICE.. if the price keeps dropping it might represent a good buying opportunity
1615815912,does it take a while for the futures account till its active?
1615815956,You will need a comfortable margin cushion. If you want to put in 100% of your 27 USDT it's gonna liq pretty fast
1615815962,I just got a margin call as well
1615815971,Set it to 50% your futures wallet and you'll have plenty of room
1615815991,so 27 initial margin and 25 or more maintenance margin
1615816010,"the more mnt margin you put in, the lower your liq price will be, the less likely it will be you get liquidated"
1615816020,you wanna avoid liquidation but not at all costs
1615816106,@bcdcdaz You can also add and remove margin once the position is open to get a liquidation price you feel comfy with
1615816411,Nope
1615816477,
1615816518,comfy with that 2.56?
1615816518,Wait why is yours mirrored
1615816534,
1615816541,Yeah
1615816553,She's only going moon now
1615816569,Well if you’re comfy with 2.56 then I’m comfy with 2.45
1615816634,I entered futures asswell with 10x and 23 usd
1615816657,10usd at 50x gave me a quick lesson:kekw:
1615816708,
1615816733,lmao that optimism
1615816801,if ENJ goes 80 bucks I would earn 139K on ENJ :kekw:
1615816828,Hey uh
1615816840,What’s the difference with these?
1615816844,I do not understand
1615816847,
1615816852,if ENJ goes to 80$ today even MSM will be all over it so it'll go to 180$ the next day 😄
1615816871,if one of them bugs out you can use the other
1615816908,"Ah thanks for that Drahnreb, I was wondering why one didn’t fill earlier and ended up loosing more than I anticipated :c"
1615817040,That's not 80 today
1615817047,That's any time
1615817050,nice! show the positions tab if you like?

1615817156,rip
1615817159,"It's great for showing off at least! 😄
I only put in $6 to guide you"
1615817175,i thought of doing so but im so fed up of futures for some time
1615817178,"yeah, you can always buy more with that leverage or a different leverage"
1615817182,just hodling some thriving coins
1615817189,I feel that
1615817198,Now we get rich
1615817202,It worked now
1615817205,hype

1615817235,did you use the calculator?
1615817235,So what happens if I buy more at market. Do all of your coins turn to the new market entry or is the position split?
1615817243,No
1615817259,Ooh that’s amazing. I’m looking to jump in and purchase about the same. I see that it’s down which is great. Dips are both buying lol
1615817260,You have a combined bag and the entry price is set to the average of all your buys
1615817280,
1615817296,
1615817313,Too easy with enjin
1615817327,"Unless you are in hedging mode, then every new long or short order becomes a separate position"
1615817347,Whats the worst that happens I lose 27usdt
1615817352,@bcdcdaz That's if it hits $10:
1615817372,"oh wait, you're selling 10 ENJ at $10"
1615817380,that's $100 (easy math) 😄
1615817395,but by the time it hits that your whole pos will be worth $776.49
1615817395,"Yeah of course, I’m always interested at entry positions and amounts, if you’re comfortable with sharing shoot me a reply :p don’t have to, just in love with comparing atm!"
1615817410,"If i press ""close position"" it exits the long with current profit?"
1615817419,patience is key in crypto 💵
1615817430,oh rly? Then I must've always been in hedge mode
1615817447,"C'est incroyable, monsieur!! Tres tres bien"
1615817470,chad trade there
1615817500,
1615817501,"Not quite. Puts up a market order, which can be a bit lower or higher than the last update of your profit display. But in essence, yeah"
1615817521,She's green everyday now not even a step down
1615817543,Rapid growth like the incredible hulk on viagra
1615817556,Cmoon ENJ grab that 3.00
1615817570,Too low
1615817644,I m back on Enj. 🙂 got 100 of it for 2.50 :))))
1615817654,Will be holding now.
1615817660,I made 0.06 dollar on my first leverage
1615817663,Look at us. Doing penny futures 😆
1615817669,still dont understand half of it
1615817676,After fees? Or before 😆
1615817702,I just clicked something 😦
1615817717,
1615817720,its more complicated then spot trading damn
1615817729,Every little helps.  Also@I have no idea sadly too. Other wise I’d be already Xing :))
1615817745,My first future was ETH from 1485 to 1830 so unfortunately I set the bar quite high
1615817754,Adding more won't higher my liquidation price?
1615817761,Ever since then? Not great
1615817765,Higher it I mean
1615817772,Yeah it will
1615817791,Because your entry price will change and become an average of new entry and original entry
1615817796,Your liq will do the same
1615817802,"Ouch, when do fees come in play? When you close the position?"
1615817832,@Kyle
1615817863,oh shit I should take isolated and not cross right
1615817867,Ah but becoming an average isn't bad
1615817886,get banned dumbass :kekw:
1615817928,
1615817939,300!!!!!
1615817966,I believe isolated is the way to go
1615818005,If you’re comfortable with that. You’d lose that 2.56
1615818025,???
1615818041,somebody posted a invite
1615818046,deleted it after we called you
1615818049,but if I time her dips and add bit by bit
1615818054,Spammer but they’ve vanished
1615818063,That’s the key to success
1615818067,
1615818073,Let’s go
1615818081,I love this shit
1615818113,Now imagine if you did this back at under a dollar
1615818131,that 100% is compared to your invested amount?
1615818137,Yes
1615818138,so 100 dollar is now 200?
1615818140,Yes
1615818144,How do i change my stop loss and take profit after i entered position?
1615818146,ok
1615818182,if I knew about this at my £0.35-0.45 buy ins
1615818188,us in a week  *entire discord lost their savings by wrong futures*
1615818188,
1615818222,tried the adding to my long it does seem like it averages like @SeineJanie said
1615818225,I've sat with 220 enjin 3 days ago
1615818274,but seems like I can't increase my long. maximum 3 enj I can add
1615818276,daaamn

1615818320,yes

1615818359,yeah I got 250 USDT ready but nope
1615818378,Yeah it’s like capped at anything over 20x
1615818386,I don’t really know the specifics around that
1615818387,demolished my very generous chart
1615818406,That chart tells me an asteroid is going to hit in five days
1615818421,$10 friday
1615818427,Behave
1615818464,I’m screenshotting that and setting a reminder on Friday
1615818476,How many new coins release this week?
1615818479,eth
1615818526,they're binance smartpool partners
1615818623,"If alice is on erc-1155 or funded in any way by enjin, what happened today will be enormous for enjin tomorrow"
1615818722,
1615818739,Look at the difference in volume to yesterday
1615818784,Alice is not launched yet
1615818789,its planned januari 2022
1615818862,no but she landed on binance today and pumped
1615818866,"im gonna set a stop ""loss"" at 250% i think for now"
1615818873,or the beta is for july 2021
1615818886,yea but alice will not cause extra usage
1615818895,the trading features are not active yet
1615818907,I will look into alice and see if they are linked in any way
1615818921,they are linked
1615818924,Alice? Last I heard she was in Wonderland
1615818931,but the game is not released yet for the public :p
1615818944,it's to do with alices price more than her usage
1615818977,screw it went YOLO and 5X margin bought ENJ
1615818980,thats why us and chz both went mental
1615818996,chz went mental because of the football thing no?
1615818999,oh my god my paper hadns
1615819013,sold at 2.73
1615819026,because PSG etc tweeted and the fanbase massively was using it
1615819066,Isn’t it just because NFTs are the hot thing
1615819142,
1615819173,*cries in US*
1615819177,I can’t future
1615819391,

1615819453,Damn 10x leverage is exciting
1615819513,I 50x ADA when it got to under a dollar and pulled out at something like 700%
1615819519,That was fucking wild
1615819598,its been a wild ride so far
1615819610,6 dollar profit
1615819648,this feels like gambling :p
1615819664,
1615819700,You made 20$

1615819713,
1615819764,Take my original stake back soon and the rest is all profit
1615819869,$4.5 is “soon”?
1615819877,I wonder how it will feel to be liquidated
1615819889,lmao wait until you get The Text
1615819915,2.73 is my liq price
1615819921,that's one bad candle 😂
1615819941,It hurts. I fucked up on vet :kekw:
1615820028,
1615820070,it's only £20 I put in tho
1615820070,BTC is goign to dump soon if ENJ keeps trying to test 2.9
1615820472,How is that correlated and what will that mean for ENJ?
1615820585,the volume to push ENJ is so huge that people will sell their BTC
1615820592,so BTC will crash
1615820699,What’d you do
1615820756,Panicked sold. Think il short. Nope
1615820788,I’d put money on VET not breaking .08 yet but idk if it’ll go down from .077 either
1615821155,why is evryone talkin bout ENJ wats so special bout it
1615821196,Dude. You live under a rock?
1615821201,yh
1615821220,Its the hottest sexiest juiciest crypto lately
1615821227,next entry point at 2.78? Or perhaps even lower? (15' chart)
1615821230,Google
1615821262,Japanese are really into it and its being integrated in games for ingame purchases
1615821270,"Also for NFT,s"
1615821279,Can soon be used to buy property
1615821297,this place is also a bubble where everyone is hyped by ENJ too so don't overestimate it and put your eggs in several baskets 🙂 (i'm saying this while holding some ENJ too though)
1615821332,Has a new game launch this week with a 24btc and 35k enjin prize
1615821332,ah isee
1615821375,2 basket preferably being CHR khem khem....totally not shilling
1615821430,and many others.
1615821437,I really believed it could potentially reach 1.00 but it went quiet now. Back to 0.45 - 0.55 range
1615821444,"XVG, REEF, LTC for instance are still very low to me"
1615821466,LUNA has pumped a lot but it could get higher still seeing its principle
1615821486,ETH is cheap also
1615821492,According tto @ARSNL  reef rot rug-pulled today
1615821494,i wanna buy luna on principle
1615821498,the principle being luna is my gfs nickname
1615821576,Don’t use pancake swap
1615821581,It has been hacked
1615821595,DNS hijack

1615821659,
1615821668,There’s a whole thread thing if u click cz tweet
1615821709,2x futures on enj long term seem to be a solid deal.any downsides doing that ? like maintainance fee or some rates i should know about?
1615821741,
1615821942,
1615821962,"fudge, if you click limit on your future"
1615821970,what does it do?
1615821977,I expected I could fill in a number 😂
1615822005,Uhhh I think you can close your position somehow doing that
1615822006,Any chance that it corrects to 78 again?
1615822020,yes it closed
1615822031,"with what then, limit sell on the current price?"
1615822088,I believe so
1615822107,Ask @Jeremyfto he did that with ETH and it was the beginning of the end
1615822129,I can see the addiction of this leveraging
1615822152,The limit button creates a limit order using the price and size that is to the right of the position
1615822164,right not left*
1615822174,"so to the right of limit, there are 2 text boxes"
1615822185,one says a price
1615822188,the other says the amount
1615822198,you can click limit to create a limit order using that price and amount
1615822205,"@Jeremyfto bro, thanks for answering my questions about futures last friday, i made some good money over the weekend 😺"
1615822215,Glad to hear 😄
1615822277,yup
1615822346,I don’t think it’s a good thing that VTHO is over a penny now
1615822398,yoo

1615822412,no
1615822414,yes
1615822567,I dont know yet. But ENJ will be fine.
1615822594,I don't think anyone would manipulate BTC just to stop ENJ
1615822623,What would be the use of that?
1615822683,!warn @UTF We dont do that here
1615822684,
1615822692,ok
1615822697,"there is a secret organisation that wants to stop ENJ reaching 3 dollar, they combine their assets to drop BTC when it is close to happen"
1615822699,Why do people start mass dumping a coin in the bull run @\MeeM/
1615822709,fr lmao
1615822760,"OH HEY THIS COIN IS UP 20 % LETS DUMP IT TO 10% SO IT CAUSES A BEAR FUD MOVEMENT 

:kekw:"
1615822767,So you think that theory is legit?!
1615822810,Im gonna dump BTC to 1$. You guys ready?
1615822821,hold on one sec
1615822825,Secret deal
1615822832,need to transfer some money to my futures account first
1615822846,pancake swap got hijacked
1615822860,Shoulda went for waffles instead smh
1615822862,"I give you 50 dollars, you dump to 1$ and then instantly to 60 again"
1615822865,Deal?
1615822902,"If I could dump it to 1$, 50$ would be less than chump change 😂. Imagine all the profits from shorting it 😂 😂"
1615822921,gender swap
1615822926,I'd literally buy 5k btc and dump it on you
1615822935,So not a great deal 😂
1615822951,"damn I though I bought 800 ENJ, and I bought 40 lol"
1615822985,"Now you gotta buy 40,000,000. That is the deal"
1615823001,"I was like, 20% profit, 20 bucks lets gooo"
1615823009,and I got 1 😂
1615823013,Longing ENJ with small bag alongside @bcdcdaz 👌🏻
1615823064,Tried that with 20 bucks and got an instant liquify :kekw:
1615823087,"Lemme guess, you put all in leverage and only minimum in maintenance margin?"
1615823107,wow where is that setting
1615823111,I don't even know how that works properly
1615823116,wait so we arent going 70x ENJ?!?
1615823120,Was my first test future
1615823128,Dammit. I must have gotten the days wrong
1615823144,I would of done that if I could of :kekw:
1615823146,It's basically how far to the right you put the slider
1615823164,The FUCKING slider won't GO fucking FURTHER!!
1615823170,but there is a button on the left that has a single click
1615823188,I was here waiting to add more to my 50x but cant buy more. :kekw:
1615823190,actually not entirely accurate. This only really affects cross; That slider is how much you buy from what you currently have in your wallet
1615823196,mine won't go past fucking 20
1615823204,"the less you buy on cross, the more you have to maintain your position"
1615823210,oh right
1615823213,I mostly do cross
1615823222,Gotcha! Its the best for high leverage tbh
1615823223,you have to manually add on isolated
1615823233,I thought cross was more risky because it liquidated your entire pf?
1615823236,Isolated is great for lower leverage long hauls
1615823237,So you dont get auto murdered?
1615823242,but it's not really that much different... if you put in 100% you'd have to move more USDT to your futures wallet to add margin to your isolated pos
1615823261,I wish I didnt close my position to test on ENJ on 2.7 lol
1615823262,"No, because I usually do short-lived 125x BTC futures with a single pos"
1615823281,The difference is if you have more in your wallet than what you are willing to risk on a position
1615823291,"Not your entire pf, only what's in futures wally"
1615823302,Ohhh I see
1615823304,**and** not set a sl
1615823320,Whats a SL 😂 jkjk everyone should use a SL
1615823326,@SeineJanie how come you like trading with cross over iso then? :p
1615823342,Cross is better for larger leveraged positions
1615823349,"if you see, they are using a 50x position"
1615823353,Because then I don't have to manage futures wallet **and** isolated margin
1615823359,
1615823361,Oh i getcha
1615823378,Cross also saves you on fees
1615823379,"ah, you did another one!"
1615823394,"I’m kicking myself for sitting this ENJ long out, I hovered over the button and everything but didn’t fancy loosing any money again today 😄"
1615823404,"because cross only uses what you NEED at that time, you are paying minimal funding fees with cross"
1615823414,the more you know
1615823418,https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-meme-gif-7715402
1615823439,600%%
1615823442,"with isolated, you pay fees on the added margin even if its not being used at the time"
1615823453,"So arguable, if you’re not running any other futures, it’s actually more beneficial to use cross then? Because, let’s say, if you do reach your liq price, it’ll act the same as an iso where it’ll just take that money without touching your spot 🤔"
1615823463,"Ah, that can get annoying I bet"
1615823476,how do we calculate the fees?
1615823482,yes adding slowly from my pnl
1615823484,Let’s see if BTC closes a red candle on the 4hr
1615823493,"Cross is great for singular cross positions, low wallet value OR extremely high wallet value, and high leverage positions"
1615823506,so for me 😉
1615823514,"Isolated is great for multiple positions, medium wallet value, and low to medium leverage positions"
1615823517,Enj 3$ attempt
1615823519,huh
1615823522,I shorted on ENJ
1615823526,so i should be doing cross
1615823527,noted
1615823530,"You’re a legend, I swear I owe you an arm and a leg for all the times you’ve answered my questions super clearly, much love"
1615823541,There is a Funding percentage at the top of every coin. Every coin's funding fee is different
1615823545,"The f in @Jeremyfto stands for ""Futurezzz"""
1615823548,that fee percentage is charged every 8 hours
1615823560,"3.07 LIQ, help me out whales by dumping when it hits 3"
1615823565,?
1615823572,yeo!
1615823573,Yep!
1615823575,oh
1615823577,thankyou!
1615823582,You might be good
1615823586,The timer next to it is when the next fee is charged
1615823592,I just love showing off the %% 😂
1615823603,
1615823604,not for long
1615823606,its so fun isnt it
1615823608,it will drop like a brick
1615823622,not bad for 20 fuckin bucks
1615823626,then get a short setup bb 😉
1615823639,Take profits man
1615823655,https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/821048103519387665
1615823656,im takin profits by raising SL
1615823657,and then ending up not selling at that % and leaving even ? 🥲
1615823676,Wow nearly 500% 😮
1615823678,I don't frickin care. I'm with @bcdcdaz till $80 or bust 😄
1615823688,So futures are weird. Its really really REALLY hard to determine when to take profits because taking profits raises your liq price if you remove from margin and it loses your entry price if you sell the position
1615823704,Its always good to take profits but futures is argueably the hardest to decide on when
1615823707,
1615823709,:kekw:
1615823729,😂
1615823756,3!!!!!!!!!
1615823768,700%%%%
1615823779,wow
1615823782,Jesus
1615823783,ow fuck Liquidation is near 😂
1615823788,Wow
1615823796,Shit. Y'all got much better brag than me
1615823797,$3 hit
1615823805,you would have put in more than we did
1615823808,i think
1615823810,i only put in 20
1615823812,shouldn't've closed my $100 ENJ yolo this morning just so I could concentrate on work 😄
1615823819,actually ENJ is going way over it's up channel now and taking a parabolic curve so yeah limiting your position on it is safe
1615823838,"ssshhhhhh, Empty! $80 or bust!"
1615823855,the voice of reason
1615823861,and the voice of memes
1615823861,We dont speak logic here 👀
1615823863,FOMO is kicking in hard for me rn
1615823870,For reals tho be careful guys
1615823874,do not jump in now
1615823875,pls
1615823879,Things that rise this fast can crash in a heart beat
1615823881,"yes, manage your risk and trade with your head, not your gut"
1615823889,:kekw:
1615823892,"I won’t but I’m super jelly, you guys are crazy"
1615823900,wait til you see a confirmation of a reversal
1615823902,@That one belgian super cunt congrats!
1615823905,then you can short
1615823909,"Ewwww, light mode!! I'm blind now, thx"
1615823909,do you guys think that TFUEL will go ham again in the foreseeable future?
1615823923,bruhh
1615823934,@raven 🥚 do you have a prediction as to what the short will go down to? Because I’m thinking about shorting when it’s confirmed
1615823937,It can't go like that forever
1615823943,wtf
1615823944,no idea
1615823949,Needs to be a hard correction soon
1615823956,It wont. Even if it crashes its low will be higher probably
1615823959,
1615823964,maybe a hard crash to 2.5
1615823974,im bad at this aspect
1615823984,so im not who you should listen to
1615823999,Where’s my man with 3.07 liq
1615824004,I'd be more than happy with 2.8 at this point
1615824004,Is he alive?
1615824040,Is anyone thinking of shorting btw
1615824073,Dammit dude why tf is VTHO pumping
1615824078,That’s not great for VET
1615824142,Liquidated
1615824145,RIP 😂
1615824155,RIP
1615824167,also i was **THIS** close to getting liquidated in this position
1615824170,right at the start
1615824194,my price was 2.57668. its bottom was 2.57894
1615824200,monkaS
1615824202,Short now?
1615824205,Btc not looking too good
1615824212,Don’t
1615824214,Jesus christ enj
1615824220,Im waiting for BTC 1$
1615824224,this mtf not stopping
1615824228,I got my buy orders ready and everything
1615824228,What a performance
1615824230,You don’t know where it’s gonna stop
1615824231,not yet. itl be a pretty long correction i think
1615824236,okay 😮
1615824239,"ah fuck me, it barely hit my elemination"
1615824248,youll need more than 2 1 min candles to confirm reveral
1615824253,for what? BTC?
1615824351,"Defeating the FOMO is hard, but rewarding"
1615824385,shorted ada ?
1615824399,i did call that earlier btw
1615824402,shorting ada
1615824419,shorted ENJ* my bad
1615824427,LMAO well still
1615824488,is it safe to say we can short when it goes below 2.9 🤔
1615824501,or is it just far too risky in general
1615824555,i think 2.86 might be the critical number
1615824567,yes sir
1615824568,it could get there and bounce back up again
1615824575,true :p
1615824596,"if it breaks through well, then i personally would be comfortable opening a short with low margin"
1615824620,let's wait and see 👀
1615824649,Why would you short
1615824669,Cant open a short while i have a long
1615824674,Have you realized it doesn’t really go down much when it does
1615824689,you only need 5% :p
1615824691,You can in hedging mode
1615824704,Then you long
1615824714,"Bull market, enj is hot af"
1615824727,Everybody is buying every single dip
1615824732,"also note, i do have a stop less set above that number"
1615824755,its so weird setting a stop loss at above 550%
1615824759,I did a 5X margin buy on enj made out with 100 bucks profit :kekw:
1615824823,
1615824830,Trying to buy more
1615824845,Missed it I think
1615824965,every full body candle i see over $3 ill raise the SL slightly
1615825056,the real question
1615825065,when the fall happens
1615825082,do i go all in with my gains on the short with another 50x 🤑
1615825198,Nope
1615825204,It will go up
1615825220,My opinion
1615825225,Maybe you are right
1615825229,And a short is good
1615825239,Your money your decision
1615825253,Never do all in dont be wall street bets
1615825262,booooooo
1615825265,SL is stop limit?
1615825266,reasonable decisions
1615825268,boooooooo
1615825272,stop loss yea
1615825289,"Man it has to cool off for a bit, right?"
1615825313,actually shorting enj should be a great deal by now
1615825332,im being very caution with my SL and a reentry tho
1615825363,Well I'm fucked
1615825371,probably triggers this candle actually
1615825387,Enj is not normal
1615825393,I can go wherever
1615825396,It*
1615825424,"what about cardano, really shit atm"
1615825425,Logic would be that it cools off
1615825427,A wsb guy made 800k then did another yolo and he had 5k left :kekw:
1615825463,It’s currently trash
1615825466,what did he start with
1615825494,But it showed support at 1$
1615825503,"What's the support level now? 2,7?"
1615825505,While btc was going down earlier
1615825523,No idea. Probably some grand. But instead of fucking stopping when you know. He had 800K nope went all in and lost everything.
1615825526,It's just $100 so it's okay lol
1615825542,Wallstreet bets is a cancer that is disgusting that they got so popular with gamestop
1615825549,if i had 800k thats living off staking money right there
1615825560,SL hit!
1615825566,ty enj i love u
1615825575,800k is a loot of money
1615825584,Your life is changed
1615825668,Wall street bets is filled with stories like that and they egg them on to go all in YOLO over and over
1615825769,sigh why was I liquidated so close
1615825770,ICX is looking like a nice short once it starts going down
1615825948,"What does binance mean by ""margin insificient"""
1615825949,Was trying to short
1615826005,is eth a good buy rn
1615826014,exactly what it sounds like
1615826030,with a margin of x15 haha
1615826031,sometimes binance doesnt let you make the order if you use 100% of ur funds
1615826037,try 99%

1615829810,good job
1615829812,"I don't know what I was thinking, I misunderstood how much Tether was in my spot and used all of it, like 3-4k"
1615829820,"And bought at the very top,"
1615829826,Why did you buy into a coin that is up 25000%
1615829837,What was your expectation?
1615829846,50000%
1615829859,"i lost 300, but didn't have much to start off, i feel u"
1615829891,"I didn't understand what was going on... if it's rising so much, why does it reverse the moment i jump in?"
1615829903,nah it rised be4
1615829905,I get that this was a bad move
1615829907,there it's going down
1615829920,definitely ahah
1615829959,So how can I regain my 1.5-2k quickly?
1615829976,that's not how crypto works
1615829978,If I knew that then I was a millionaire
1615830002,"If I buy Alice again below the price I sold at, if it goes back up then technically I could just do the same thing in reverse right?"
1615830016,genius
1615830035,"What are you guys' opinion of REEF, do u think it will go back up?"
1615830069,it got a bad report from its partners

1615830079,nani?
1615830089,"All of you guys are posting about using margin trading and futures,"

1615830122,have a look on youtube bro seriously
1615830131,I have only done spot trading but I need to regain my 2k asap
1615830142,u can't learn to trade crypto and make 2k in 5 minutes

1615830244,damn.. fock
1615830251,i have quite a bit in reef atm
1615830274,reefusdt looks interesting atm actually
1615830313,😆
1615830322,"that's why i have quite a bit lmao, but if they got bad image cuz of almeda (subsenquently cuz of themselves) i'm scared it won't go back up"
1615830351,look at @AlamedaTrabucco on twitter and decide for yourself
1615830380,"hi just asking, what are your thoughts on enj? will it hit 4$?"
1615830391,maybe eventually

1615830463,ppl saw the first tweet and went like omg he's gonna sell all 20M tokens we gotta sell so it went down baaad
1615830478,he then clarified he wasn't selling but just advising not to do business with em
1615830486,yup
1615830492,so don't think it will have a great impact on the price
1615830498,i'll hold onto em a bit more
1615830507,at least till it goes back to the price i bought em for

1615834024,Hi
1615834933,no
1615835312,Anyone know much about ONE? Seems to be talked a lot on tiktok and insta lately
1615835477,"Yup, tiktok is well known for being full of great financial advisors, id say jump in eyes closed"
1615835514,"Hmmmm, what could be good entry point in ENJ right now, i think it wont go below 2.7"
1615835530,I’m wondering the same thing too
1615835541,The thing is
1615835553,We don’t know what btc will do
1615835584,If it drops a lot then enj will also go down
1615835588,Maybe not much
1615835595,But it would go down
1615835607,Otherwise I think it’s a good buy rn
1615835714,If it drops less than btc its still a good trade imo. Idk anything about ENJ so cant help you with that tho
1615835826,It’s extremely hyped up rn
1615835838,If btc drops tomorrow
1615835849,Enj would come out on top of btc
1615835850,Yeah i know that x) but thats the only thing i know about it 😅
1615835914,It’s like what ada was to btc during the dump a couple weeks ago
1615836103,Hello !
1615836116,just another pumped coin like ADA was some weeks ago
1615836844,"According to the ENJineer in here, anything below $50 is a good entry point. Maybe even anything below $50,000"
1615837033,@bcdcdaz I don't think we are hitting 4 :virgin:
1615837253,
1615837287,Im waiting for 2.75 entry point but it seems i will be waiting forever
1615837316,too late

1615837347,Its the space booster

1615837876,I’m only holding luna rn
1615837877,Whattt
1615837882,luna is good i bought recently
1615837885,I bought luna at $2 2months age

1615837901,You bought like 5 of them right
1615837902,
1615837904,I really believe so
1615837919,luna devs are active
1615837922,it is a $100 project
1615837926,Ur gonna see soon
1615837928,Based on
1615837932,dyor
1615837960,I mean but what in you doing your research told you “this will hit $100”
1615837963,I’ve been watching luna since 90 cents trust me I believe u🤣
1615837964,Had to be something
1615837992,Because “dyor” is usually code for “ I have no idea”
1615838022,"Good Defi project mate, lots of partnerships. with anchor, mirror, axelar"
1615838025,Already 50x
1615838033,Before that
1615838038,"During, really"
1615838045,"I mean but still, what about that tells you “this will be $100”"
1615838047,most of the coins are staked
1615838059,No it will be higher than that
1615838068,"That tells me it could very well go up, but doesn’t tell me a certain price"
1615838075,"Oh okay, so that’s just a milestone"
1615838077,5 years I bet 500-1000
1615838106,lol
1615838109,its going to a million
1615838112,DYOR
1615838162,I’ve been researching it a while and I still can’t fully wrap my head around it tbh all I know for sure is that it’s made me 8k so far
1615838181,lol
1615838182,lol ok but in all seriousness im bullish on Luna too
1615838185,ok
1615838194,who here isnt
1615838195,"best payment crypto rn, fully live in South Korea"
1615838211,doubt it will hit 100 tho

1615838223,this is cool
1615838238,sia going nuts
1615838245,Im neither bullish nor not bullish on LUNA
1615838415,What are you bullish on mr wanderer
1615838426,chr and cake
1615838438,short term
1615838462,Been hearing alot about CHR
1615838500,did you see the alice pump? you can stake CHR to earn alice
1615838501,VET lately
1615838506,CHR also only has a 200 mil market cap
1615838509,Bought in heavy at .02
1615838526,My portfolio is pretty diverse though
1615838565,I’m thinking about buying some vet
1615838590,I haven’t watched it for long enough tho
1615838596,Would this be a good time to buy
1615838648,"I mean it’s been pumping the past couple months, the bear in me says it is due for a big correction"
1615838664,The bull in me says it will hit .10 during this run though.
1615838770,it already did
1615838826,$.10?
1615838842,I do not see that on my chart
1615838887,you are right. I swear I saw 0.10 while looking at it go
1615838974,".083 is the most I’m seeing. Which, coming from .02 in three months with only one real correction is bonkers imo"
1615838986,It’s no ENJ pump that’s for sure
1615839996,Wtf
1615839999,my coin hit target
1615840003,
1615840514,sia
1615840645,don't know if I want to get in on Sia. its already pumped hard
1615840655,Not sia
1615840678,?
1615840693,Oh i meant my coin is not sia that hit target
1615840883,what does this actually imply. massive buying power or dumping power?
1615840911,It means be quiet
1615840914,Stay at home
1615840963,damn corona lockdowns in my crypto
1615840970,lost 10% on a futures play
1615841018,"realized it was going the way wrong way, took the L and switched to a short after a nicely timed reentry"
1615841030,made back the 10% plus a bit extra
1615841086,few weeks ago i woulda probably have not seen the direction properly and just lost more money
1615841448,Can someone explain that graph?
1615841474,"So the red mountain is asks right, so selling, and the green is bids"
1615841499,"But if there are more asks than bids, does the price go down?  Or up?"
1615841582,I’m not an expert but wouldn’t it suggest it would bounce around that price until the asks are satisfied and it breaks upwards or it becomes overwhelmed with more sell orders and starts to drop?
1615841605,I have no idea on that graph tbh I look at them sometimes and I’m like HUH
1615842732,
1615842844,so what are we expecting japan to do
1615842929,That chart is blurry

1615845275,"I really hope that was THE dip, damn leverage trading is super stressfull"
1615845293,Wasn’t someone in here asking if RVN was dead yesterday
1615845302,"From what I've seen, $10 ENJ in summer is more than possible"
1615845308,Crazy
1615845329,to add to the hype

1615845346,no
1615845354,x20000 in the next few years
1615845357,ENJ is the next ENJ
1615845361,ENJ could be the bitcoin for gaming
1615845361,should be
1615845373,"You don’t want to be the new BTC, you just want to have the value of BTC"
1615845376,BTC actually sucks

1615845429,Do you charge 29$ to have a transaction with you?
1615845432,"U rite, I just like to troll"
1615845437,
1615845441,😏
1615845449,Btc is like an old man trying to climb a staircase and falling down some stairs every couple days
1615845468,then the nurses come and carry him up anyway
1615845480,waiting for another green candle above 2.74 to be happy
1615845494,Until he collapses at the top and needs to rest for 2 years
1615845494,The problem is that old man has fan base carrying him up the stairs
1615845524,the worst thing is that that old man is fat af and all the alt coins are below him on the stairs when he falls

1615849286,3.19
1615849308,3.16

1615849351,"Oh, for LTC. I see"
1615849362,This is ENJ only chat
1615849370,I doubt it’ll go below 2.7 for a while though which is promising
1615849397,"Dont do this with ENJ. Just invest, and trust. HODL"
1615849405,Yes sir
1615849426,I've lost 25% of my ENJ the first week of it with that thought
1615849443,How long can you keep a long position open? As long as you want?

1615849491,I suppose so. Better be. Lol. Fuck ``futures`` otherwise if it doesn't hodl till the future
1615849509,"Yes you can, that's why they are called perpetual"
1615849519,as long as you want. you will be paying a maintenance fee or whatever its called but its not much
1615849532,Is there also a non-perpetual?
1615849543,some coins have them
1615849551,I guess some people have reasons for why they would want that
1615849554,Ohhhhh. I get it now.

1615849570,Oh yeah. Wondered what those were

1615853140,Someone just mentioned on a stream that BTC is that old uncle boomer walking slowly up the stairs with a walking stick while you walk behind patiently just waiting for a tiny gap to move past. What would happen if the old uncle keeps intentionally blocking your way.
1615853166,"Imma take that stick, and beat that old uncle to death with it"

No other coin currently has what ENJ has. And what ENJ has is a lot more than what we can confirm. And what we can confirm is absolute madness. You should really read up on the stuff dazz keeps sending."
1615853411,i don't care about ENJ in anyway
1615853416,I am just here for profit
1615853419,nothing more nothing less
1615853460,"Dont care, but dont be blind to it either. Or you'll end up one of those whiney boys who sold Bitcoin at $10. Not trying to be abnoxious"
1615853526,I mean seriously man. India might ban crypto... I cant afford to care too much at this point 🤣
1615853531,Good idea to buy some xpr while it’s dirt cheap ?:)
1615853554,@felguerr says yes.

1615853617,honestly I might just do a YOLO move and do a 20X  long on XRP
1615853660,Iv been doing this all day on ENJ. Have lost about $300. Too much volatility today.
1615853676,"Oh, but i was doing 50x"
1615853682,!ban @Important State dm spam
1615853683,
1615853685,I am doing 50X too
1615853702,I missed the train when it bottomed before. Was putting my kid to sleep
1615853705,remember when you told me that 2.6 would never hit again? that is when it came in
1615853713,*i
1615853733,but honestly. I am keeping this position for a while
1615853738,You put the call yesterday? Wow
1615853773,yeah?
1615853802,I wish i had that patience. Maybe once futures become slighly more boring. Its too exciting right now for me. Too new
1615853878,Ok. Bitcoins pattern has completely changed now. Maybe no more dips
1615853932,Or i dont know. Maybe im just seeing what i want to see
1615853982,They are just waiting for ENJ to rise again
1615854015,Satoshi himself is at war with the company :godsgardener:
1615854037,"Hey sorry to bother the enj boys, but i was wondering if anyone knows why RDN ( the raiden network token) is having such an increase today"
1615854050,like a 20% increase just now 1 minute ago
1615854073,Most alts will have that
1615854082,Yeah but out of the blue
1615854084,Bitcoin's having seizures
1615854094,"if u check the chart it was stagnant and suddenly that, and there was no whale buy either"
1615854098,americans getting their stimmy checks
1615854104,everything gonna go bananarama
1615854119,"And still going up, so is not a pump and dump either"
1615854145,Is this bananaramaup? or bananaramadown?
1615854152,up
1615854154,then down
1615854161,Yay! Banananananananaramamama
1615854318,sUSD
1615854380,Ok people. We're good
1615854461,this enj train is weird
1615854471,Yup. Very strange right now
1615854472,im just putting a $3 TP for tomorrow and go to sleep
1615854478,with my 5x future
1615854483,3.16 not 3
1615854490,why?
1615854506,its already reached 3. Needs to breach 3.02
1615854541,"Is prob correcting rn, its been on downside for a while"
1615854554,i only put $20 at 2.73 so im chilling
1615854555,When it goes up. It will REALLLY go up
1615854567,Dazz has his sell orders at $4 and $10
1615854577,Well dazz is... dazz
1615854585,Dazz is.... right
1615854586,he even has a order at $80 which sounds bad
1615854605,Because he wont want to do futures the way we do it everyday
1615854611,also i don't really get the new enj thing to buy tokens without paying fees
1615854620,what do you mean?
1615854624,ITS NOT TO BUY TOKENS!!! DAMMIT!
1615854633,why would it be used then?
1615854651,Google it. Cant get into it again now.
1615854654,I mean if that was the original purpose then i could see a enj price like 1Inch and such
1615854660,Or search for dazz's messages
1615854661,i already read about it on the page
1615854669,was never the original purpose
1615854693,Its already being integrated into BMW systems for example.
1615854695,Damn
1615854699,What a dip
1615854705,Hope we dont see 38k 🤪
1615854706,Shamz that you can buy tokens with enj now
1615854742,"If you're worried about ENJ, dont. BTC affects it only till a certain point. We've already crossed that point"
1615854771,so then you can buy tokens?
1615854786,You can buy tokens with ETH too.
1615854790,Like idk why would the new thing of enj that is coming out at 16 of april would skyrocket the price then
1615854796,if is not for buying/selling tokens
1615854801,sUSD
1615854817,DYOR. Its 6am here
1615854818,I have no idea it was just to annoy cryptoknight 😂
1615854848,You can. I'll allow it.
1615854851,What would be a reasonable price for ENJ on lets say April?
1615854864,realistically speaking. No fanaticism involved
1615854865,Lol. April is a different story altogether
1615854872,is in like 15 days
1615854887,FAAAAAAAAAACKKKKKKK! BTC!

1615856531,maybe after this we can stop talking about just enjin...
1615856545,Different things are happening now to BTC
1615856547,"On the contrary, after this enj has potential to double fast 😄"
1615856554,Eactly

1615856817,It's recovering
1615856834,In that case you can thank me now
1615856838,"Btw, nothing to worry about rn, but its better to keep it in BUSD."
1615856851,"I closed my positions and cashed in the losses, so now it can recover 😄"
1615856853,Why BUSD over USDT?
1615856855,well now u are losing money

1615857402,because I have 0 interest in the product
1615857408,Dazz will wake up and freak when he sees that his 800% profit is now 750%
1615857412,or any crypto really. crypto will never affect my life
1615857415,Or he wont freak at all

1615857606,i mean the way you said to relax bc he lost like 440k
1615857609,not out of thin air like this enj drop
1615857611,FAAAACCCCCKKKKK! I have another bad feeling
1615857613,thats literally a house money
1615857622,i didnt lose 440K though
1615857624,444
1615857628,i was just typing too quick
1615857633,Thoughts guys?
1615857637,BTC
1615857642,who knows
1615857647,Was hoping it wont slow down
1615857650,BTC has no reasoning
1615857681,well i mean
1615857682,VET literally gained through the last 3-4 hours even with that drop
1615857690,if i had some usdt i would have bought BTC at a 10% dip
1615857694,is literally free money tomorrow
1615857701,Sorry 6-7hrs
1615857702,.21 coprrelation
1615857713,please sit at 54 btc
1615857715,PLEASE
1615857786,"on the 1' chart BTC and ENJ look identical, on the 15' chart they are different"
1615857799,"Ok. Getting real time. 

1) BTC may drop furthur. Looks like it wont, but it _might_
2) ENJ was good in the last drop, bottoming out at 2.43. We can only hope this holds. 
3) Once this shit is over. We will most likely fly up. So if you've made temp arrangements, be ready."
1615857813,Don’t think I’m touching futures again for a while - I’ll just continue in projects I actually see potential in
1615857820,how much did u lost?
1615857820,Instead of tryna make a quick buck
1615857830,"""I'll never drink again"""
1615857833,
1615857837,Yeah BTC is dropping more as we speak
1615857842,I think you might have jumped the gun. I've learnt today never to do it in FOMO. If you feel it. Hands off!
1615857842,
1615857846,"Only £40, but that’s a lot for someone who’s already in a a big student debt already"
1615857856,Yeah I’ve said that one too many times before
1615857857,My ENJ liq is 2.33 @Cryptoknight how do you feel about this
1615857878,who knows
1615857885,"If this is a worry, we'll know in the next dip itself. If any"
1615857890,if BTC decides to far to 51K it wont be enough
1615857899,"Well that’s the thing, I think we would have made money if BTC didn’t dump on us, had it not, ENJ could be up to $3 by now lol"
1615857905,Hmmm BTC is at end of 25% retrace by looks of things. Buyers have re entered market.
1615857909,Do you realise what a dip like this means for BTC?
1615857910,man i love this btc rollecoaster
1615857920,See? Feel better now guys.
1615857927,you could have sold at 3
1615857938,Dude. STOP!
1615857947,No point of these. Its been a stressful evening
1615857949,as a matter of fact I do
1615857949,i could of but I got FOMO'd :kekw:
1615857952,do you? its nbd for btc lol
1615857962,"Which meant I bought enj, vite, storj at good prices"
1615857985,How sure are you. Like 70%?
1615857990,Of BTC drop stop
1615858005,its impossible to truly predict BTC
1615858007,"After this massacre that left us bloody and injured, the dark clouds split, the sky opens and on a ray of light @Sausage Destroyer descents to tell us that it is all over now"
1615858029,I know. Hence the probabibilty %
1615858038,"I look at multiple indicators, this was big retracement for sure, could drift a little sideways and slightly down but no more vicious drop I dont think"
1615858051,why vite
1615858055,Ok. I'm going in then
1615858058,Too many buyers re entering for that
1615858060,everyone talks about it but only has like 24 btc on circulation
1615858079,"Shall I say fuck it, sell everything in my spot to make up my losses on another ENJ long 😂"
1615858102,It is very firmly oversold at this moment - BTC
1615858108,https://tenor.com/view/wojak-crypto-dump-green-wojak-oh-no-gif-16294467
1615858128,"you didn't last long, didn't you? 😂"
1615858142,Ahhh 😂
1615858152,"But if there is enough shorting energy, BTC might diarrhea on everything again but its very very temporary just move your stop losses down, unless you are using leverage in which case you're gonna get rekt"
1615858163,It actually seems safe now though :c

1615858167,My liquidation is 2.52 now
1615858169,pray
1615858173,leverage is asking for money or what
1615858183,like it doesn't affect the futures thing
1615858187,🤞🏻🙏🏻
1615858192,Yeah rejection of the bottom but I will be more confident in about 45 mins for  my prediction
1615858204,futures uses leverage
1615858212,How did you lose 440? I cant put in more than 100$
1615858233,adding margin
1615858237,Ohhh
1615858240,Leverage. And in my case also multiple coins
1615858251,so? why would i get rekt using margin
1615858272,you use USDT margin to lower your liq point so you don't get kicked out from a dip
1615858273,youll get liquidated
1615858284,exactly
1615858289,so why would it be a bad thing
1615858292,which means it will autosell when you hit a certain loss
1615858293,"Feel sorry for you that you had to sell other coins to increase your liq, at least you’re safe (hopefully) now 🤞🏻"
1615858295,u put more money knowing it will go up
1615858298,OK. Im out of futures for now. Not working out
1615858300,it locks in ur losses
1615858305,because the more margin you add the more you lose if you arent there to add more or bail out
1615858313,that is the liquidation price correct
1615858323,yes
1615858337,and obvs u dont want to sell at a loss right
1615858339,And im out guys! Fun ride!
1615858345,Thank you. 🙂 I would feel better if I could at least have sold them with a profit instead of cashing in losses to prevent them from eating up my margin
1615858379,Are you out of enj?
1615858384,"That’s always the sad part, I’m sure you’ll be able to make it back with ENJ, especially if it does go up to 3.15"
1615858391,you should be relatively safe
1615858406,Neva eva eva eva. Going to bed
1615858417,sleep well and stay solid 😄

1615858833,im not liquidated just yet
1615858847,im still in all my positions
1615858860,Most likely u won't.i also just put in 100$ and added 200$ as margin.
1615858861,"I'm helping bitcoin go up, I opened an isolated 125x short for 0,5$ 😄"
1615858868,DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS LETS FUCKING GO
1615858878,Is there any way to make so binance alerts u on the phone when ur money is about to get liquidated?
1615858880,if it goes down again now it is because my short got liquidated
1615858885,fuck bears. fuck their mother fuck their sisters fuck their brothers with a broom
1615858895,Don't do that please. Binance will try to liquidate u by bring the price down on the exchange
1615858911,i think so I think you can get margin alerts
1615858915,Should we expect another drop during the night ?

1615858982,@That one belgian super cunt so are u up from those -444k yet?
1615858990,444 dollars
1615858995,and im at -154 ATM
1615859000,but that is from my BNB and ada positions
1615859010,I just got in Ada
1615859012,Relax. Its looking good rn
1615859018,Idk yet if I sell or not xD
1615859022,
1615859022,For the night
1615859073,atleast the good thing is that extreme drops like this probably will give enj stronger bottom support
1615859080,I dont know. I am tired its almost 3 AM
1615859080,@That one belgian super cunt Just so you know im in this with you
1615859087,which one is better to long future at the moment? enj or bnb?
1615859105,ENJ probably.
1615859114,i see enj doing a 2X quicker than BNB
1615859119,The stop loss is a tad higher than liquidation point. I dont want my phone waking up my baby
1615859125,and with 10X margin you would do a 20X
1615859140,10x???? Im at 50x
1615859147,im talking to kanye
1615859153,GOD DAMMIT! ITs 30x. Shit!~
1615859160,:kekw:
1615859187,i wonder what ENJ will do now that BTC is chilled out
1615859194,Dont long anything until you're sure BTC is done dropping tho
1615859200,Mana thoughts?
1615859210,"well this is speculation, we can never know lol"
1615859217,i want to sleep rn in 1 hour so i have time
1615859229,but also don't want enj to return to 2.70 and miss the free money
1615859256,You want to open a long then go to sleep?
1615859313,@Sausage Destroyer and what is your opinion on the BTC situation now?
1615859332,is that stupid?
1615859345,I mean i will put last price profit at $3 so either way im profiting
1615859369,"I want to call the Post Grad but i will prob get ""re muted"" again lol"
1615859405,Looking at the market en id say yes tbh. Its very risky at least

1615859536,"10 mins, if not the 4 to 5 hours. It's one or the other. Hopes it's the first so btc doesn't habe chance to shit on us again"
1615859568,I have 2 dogs and a 2 year old. Go figure.
1615859596,"man I longed bnb because i was like ""no way its gonna go lower than its been in like a month"" but nope"
1615859597,nearly did
1615859605,think it was like 8 bucks away from my bnb liq
1615859626,is going up now anyways?
1615859633,@That one belgian super cunt
1615859649,It's the second. Damn.
1615859657,bnb? depends on BTC but 238 should be pretty good
1615859662,i just don't know what to do
1615859671,exit ENJ with no profit
1615859675,or YOLO and risk sleeping
1615859685,hmm im between putting $20 on enj or bnb long
1615859710,I am 100% sure organically ENJ won't drop to 2.38 levels but with BTC being manipulated by whales
1615859712,i dont know
1615859725,"@That one belgian super cunt if u haven't liquidated yet, it's unlikelly u will. Even with another drop. Unless like it's to 45k or something"
1615859729,whats ur entry
1615859733,i mean the big dip is over so
1615859737,2.5998
1615859739,If btc drops hard its definitely going under tho
1615859740,a 10% dip on btc is a lot
1615859754,Same here. 2.564
1615859769,whaaat i would have expected you to have a crazy low entry
1615859776,considering the shilling lol

1615859803,Solidarity
1615859806,rightt
1615859810,idk if enj is going to $3 tomorrow tho
1615859817,It should
1615859817,pretty big dip leads to stagnation
1615859832,TBH stagnation is better down
1615859841,"Maybe, but unlikely. Enj is not controlled by people dealing in enj"
1615859872,Oh fuck
1615859880,It's 16th
1615859883,enj needs to go up 50% from where it is now 😠
1615859888,anything beyond that would be profit
1615859897,so?
1615859904,Isn't that btc giveaway today?? 32btc?
1615859911,Enj will go nuts

1615860082,@That one belgian super cunt
1615860083,Should be. I'll liquidate earliere that you anyway. Lol
1615860105,3.01
1615860113,none. i was just gonna ride it. i probably would of taken it at 3.5 or 4
1615860120,4 would be like 1 K profit
1615860139,Don't do that. It won't stay up there for long if it reaches while u sleep
1615860148,how much did u put?
1615860156,oh u are at like 20x
1615860158,Lol. Don't put 4
1615860171,oh wait
1615860178,4 will be after you guys wake up only
1615860180,if I sell at 4 I would win 2.5 K
1615860229,It's a risk. U can wait and not put anything. But then if this btc shot happens before 4 then ur in the same boat
1615860229,so in like 10 hours?
1615860245,I'll wake up in 4 hours
1615860252,Somewhat
1615860267,Not on pc now so can't check

1615860695,yo guys
1615860706,is listing on Huobi
1615860716,just saw it on their twitter that is listing on 15 march at 3pm
1615860769,idk what that exchange is but it means new people i suppose
1615860885,Enj?
1615861002,That won't havea measurable effect on enj on binance
1615861028,Thats what i was abt to say
1615861037,i mean isn't enj value global?
1615861066,Volume on Huobi is 300 times lower than on binance
1615861068,Every exchange has their own rate that is influenced by trades on that exchange. But they will always be very close to each other
1615861111,ENJ is probably going to peak on Huobi in the first minutes of trading before settling for the same rate as on Binance
1615861126,well thats why the TP thing is for lol
1615861130,SLP BOUGHT THE BOUNCE

1615866730,"last time it corrected in february, the majority was waiting for a 41k-42k dip (myself included), 43k was the lowest and it never went there again"
1615866763,the infamous head and shoulders pattern that was visible from an airplane from like a week ago? everyone was just waiting for a massive drop
1615866765,never happened
1615866773,we really can't know 😦
1615866906,"if it drops more, I really have a hard time seeing it go anywhere below 52k"
1615866912,"but then again, I really don't know"
1615866970,I mean we'd be rich if we could predict the future lmao
1615866987,true
1615867011,"with stimulus being deployed soon, all signs point to a recovery and a soon-to-be-reached new ath"
1615867030,perhaps this needed to happen to go way beyond 60k
1615867073,"and if that's the case, altcoins won't take a break for a while"
1615867074,"Definitely, that'll have a huge impact on the price. Does everyone gets it at the same time btw?"
1615867102,"new ath, altcoins dumped, then btc immediately dumps, altcoins dumped... if btc will now chase a new ath, altcoins will again dump"
1615867109,it's honestly so frustrating
1615867118,Lmao Alice is on futures 😂😂 if any of u guys like to gamble x)
1615867131,"no, but it will be deployed to everyone within a period of several days.. so in theory, you could say yes.."
1615867138,everyone will get it in a fairly same time period
1615867149,$luna hit an ATH twice in a day 🤯
1615867171,"Mhh.. i was wondering if it was a good x125 opportunity lol, i guess not then ^^'"
1615867190,"and the thing is about TA, very little people are accounting world events, news and what's happening in the society in their TA"
1615867203,stimulus is bound to make a change that is hard to predict solely on graphs
1615867217,"I wouldn't wrap my head around this too much, just go along with it"
1615867238,Thats why you need TA and FA lol
1615867253,exactly
1615867360,enj is looking really bad right now
1615867374,"btc is moving sideways, but enj is taking a downfall"
1615868663,"Im hoping theres a lot of Age of Rust potential players going after that treasure hunt.  I mean, be in their best interest to get ENJ as high as possible before the hunt starts in game on Friday."
1615868989,"Game looks like it sucks a royal dick though, so once that hunt is over, it'll prob go extinct in a hurry."
1615872064,scary market
1615872080,im making some good trades but it's nerve wracking 😱
1615873469,When sub 50k tho
1615874594,It just needs to stop dragging those alts around
1615874604,Then I'm happy
1615874616,Hey guys
1615874635,why is ENJ still dropping lol
1615874691,Like what?
1615874710,im just doing short term futures on ENJ atm lol
1615875037,lmao how much x?
1615875043,@HellSpawn
1615875094,20
1615875100,im down now tho 😦
1615875174,my trade on enj liquidated last night lol
1615875195,any thoughts on ve chain ?
1615875224,"ALICE makes enj down, ALICE is the same gaming token, people try to use ALICE"
1615875372,Its not the same
1615875390,ALICE is a specific game token
1615875414,For my neighbor is Alice game
1615875692,Was looking at it before yesterday and regretted not jumping on at 6.7c
1615875734,Might be a good time to buy when btc stops falling again
1615876583,Fuck
1615876584,No
1615876586,Btc
1615876592,Stay under 55k please
1615876601,Im so mad I missed the ENJ dump
1615876605,I knew it was coming soon
1615876615,too bad I didnt trade todday
1615876621,Don't worry it's not over
1615876622,Only good thing about the crash is ada
1615876632,I tried to catch the dip
1615876634,The support at 1$ is unreal
1615876636,It wasn’t the dip lol
1615876645,Ada is holding super strong yeah :)
1615876646,Its over enough for it to not be worth the risk for me
1615876651,So you aren’t missing it Jeremy
1615876656,Its still ongoing
1615876663,I might pick up some enj
1615876666,I dont see it going lower than 2$ tbh
1615876677,Which is why its not really worth for me
1615876683,I’m heading to work
1615876683,I'll hope you are right
1615876689,It might but I doubt it.
1615876702,"Fuck me, my SL didn’t trigger on enj"
1615876703,Oh you mean shorting?
1615876706,dropping a entire 33% would be crazy
1615876719,yep!
1615876741,im almost tempted to jump on but ill prob just wait it out
1615876751,I think it will push back to 2.8 once it stops dipping
1615876777,You should long it
1615876818,"Im gonna wait. It may drop more. I knew this was bound to happen. Like I said, it was a grenade. Its finally blown up now"
1615876829,made good profits on the way up tho so IG its worth
1615876835,https://tenor.com/view/elmo-shrug-%E4%B8%8D%E9%80%A0-i-dont-know-gif-5094560
1615876851,ada might actually get me to my TP mark too
1615876856,🙏
1615876987,well lets hope it goes back again for my long future
1615877076,XRP gang
1615877088,🧟‍♂️
1615877227,Any good cryptos to long/short rn?
1615877308,BTC about to hit 55k
1615877373,"retested 53k 3 times, showed good support. perhaps it's time to go up"
1615877430,to the moon
1615877522,Im putting a stop limit on ENJ in case it recovers
1615877529,not getting in till 2.6 tbh
1615877536,too risky until then
1615877547,you mean long or normal spot?
1615877598,"No. I mean a stop limit on futures. Basically with normal limits, it will buy at x price OR LOWER. Stop Limits say ""do not buy until it hits this price"""
1615877612,They are useful for automating jumping in on the recovery
1615877637,"but like if you create a limit order right now at 2.6, it would auto fill because we are under 2.6; This is when stop limits come in handy"
1615877672,its to the right of market on the drop down
1615877702,You basically say when you want it to be executed and for what price. I have mine creating a limit order for 2.6 AT 2.6
1615877718,"Until it gets to 2.6, no limit orders will be made"
1615877741,why 2.6 tho? U wait for if there is another dip?
1615877746,Hey everyone!
1615877768,2.6 is a large enough jump for it to be looking like recovery
1615877777,It may be too low but thats kinda the risk I am taking
1615877784,2.7 would be safer
1615877790,Id rather get more profits tho
1615877796,"Just recently got into crypto, I decided to buy 1k worth of Polygon Matic. Thoughts?"
1615877799,same
1615877811,im honestly waiting with my already $60 futures on enj till $3
1615877824,may as well wait since all of this
1615877838,I spent 500 on enj as well and I wish I had bought more at 1.19
1615877938,The 3 month chart looks pretty sharp which either means its getting great success or its over bought. I personally would just keep an eye on it if I were you; It could keep going or it could correct losing value
1615877952,"regardless, if you bought the coin straight out, it may be a pretty good long hold"
1615877991,Copy. Thanks for the feedback. Guess I'll wait it out a bit before I make any decisions
1615878019,Should i fill my enj bags up?
1615878031,2.50 doesn’t seem bad to me
1615878049,"last time enj up to 3.0 in just one day, so it can be up to 4.0 dollar for one day again"
1615878109,i don't think that it can go from a big dip of 2.30 to 4
1615878179,@NotMatt i am buying it
1615878202,"considering the correction down to 2.35, it could very well hit a new ath"
1615878210,especially with that game event happening tomorrow and what not
1615878214,"sure, i just bought there at 2.40"
1615878216,"idk, just my thoughts"
1615878225,"as always guys, btc is the king, btc moves the market"
1615878233,why would it go up bc a game is coming out?
1615878235,always have a btc tab open and check it regularly
1615878251,Go little enj go
1615878252,"the games of enj are not pretty good tbh, coming from someone that tried the first one"
1615878252,"too many factors depend on bitcoin and its performance and trends, don't forget that"
1615878299,"it may not appeal to you, but don't underestimate the size of a gaming community that may be enjoying it"
1615878316,"gaming as a whole is enormous, and goes beyond the regular COD, GTA and FIFA, especially in the asian market"
1615878329,I think people need to buy Enjin to do stuff in the game?
1615878341,"Take in mind, the only reason of why enj is going up is because of BTC. look at the 15 min charts on both"
1615878365,"It did outperform BTC yesterday though, at least"
1615878369,"basically, but is literally a grindy game where the only thing u can do is go to same design generated chambers and kill the same set of 3 enemies"
1615878371,Maybe Europe who now wakes up can clean up that mess people did tonight. I'll take another nap and hope to wake up to less red at least. 😴
1615878461,"Lets hope so, im buying a bit more of enj if it reaches 2.60 and it doesn't crash"
1615878510,The infamous Asian trading session... Did it again
1615878540,Put a leverage on 2.44 but my stop loss hit
1615878543,Sigh
1615878558,Rip
1615878570,We thought they'd help and then they open a second front at pearl harbor
1615878633,ADA pump soon? ??
1615878695,Only if there’s hype around the Africa blockchain conference.
1615878706,Bet. I'm buying another $500 of enj
1615878722,Just gonna risk it and buy it now
1615878730,"Hard to predict at this point. If there’s news that comes out of that conference that suggests Ethiopia is on board, then expect the price to go higher"
1615878850,"@bcdcdaz Darren, mate! Sorry you got liquidated."
1615878922,how did he got liquidated?
1615879106,Is it on the 18th?
1615879133,"Yup, 18th-19th"
1615879151,Ok great
1615879160,so possible that we see some hype pump before and possible correction if no news.
1615879168,Then on april 1st it goes full decentralized
1615879186,"yeah not far off, very exciting at the moment"
1615879193,"I assume he was, if he didn't close his position before. His liq price was somewhere around 2.60 USDT I think"
1615879201,If we get some good news out of the conference we might see a good rise
1615879209,depends what the news is i guess
1615879213,Yup
1615879224,It should be regarding the africa thing
1615879230,"@Kayne Not his whole pf, if that's what you're thinking. Just an ENJ yolo future."
1615879230,personally hoping for at least the confirmation of one Africa nation buying into the vision
1615879240,If only the price moved up to 1.20
1615879252,what did you buy in at?
1615879262,Around 1.20
1615879277,damn its been a tough couple weeks for you holding on then haha
1615879281,But i’v been holding soo long
1615879286,4k
1615879288,your patience should be rewarded soon
1615879290,In the position
1615879316,"i've got 4-4.5k in it, but i've been in mainly from 28-42c"
1615879317,I hope to make at least a couple grands
1615879334,It’s a 3x leverage
1615879335,should have 11k coins after next pay
1615879355,Good morning.
1615879356,hopefully it pays off for you then
1615879359,Hi
1615879363,Hoping man
1615879364,hey
1615879383,Time to look at binance and see if I got my enj position liquidated
1615879391,got as low as 2.39 i think
1615879409,"sorry, 2.34"
1615879427,yep
1615879432,just want my HBAR to bounce back up haha
1615879444,u know belgian this is the reason why as u said u don't need to sleep
1615879464,:kekw: i fucking surviced
1615879468,Survived
1615879531,im fucking addicted fuck
1615879537,im putting $60 more on futures
1615879540,Jesus. 2 cents away from liquidation. That was close
1615879635,No wait 1 cent
1615879650,"If I hadn't closed those other 3 positions tonight, I would have been liquidated. 💀"
1615879660,why would u put ur liq at 2.3499999
1615879661,I'm banning myself from futures haha
1615879697,"First I thought it was the right thing to do, then I thought I made a mistake. Now I know I was right all along. Silver lining. 😃"
1615879704,Literally right before i fell asleep i put in 100 bucks to drop from 2.34 to 2.33 😫 holy shit  if i didnt i would of been done
1615879726,bro
1615879732,just put long till $3 now
1615879733,ez gains
1615879738,i think at least
1615879750,Whats the worst that could happen 🙂
1615879774,Liquidation
1615879885,coin?
1615879920,enj
1615879930,hey @That one belgian super cunt we are going back in time
1615879934,I am hovering right above or below entry i cant exit and cant get a better entry
1615879959,i would buy at 2.50
1615879962,but thats just me
1615879970,i seriously doubt it will go to 2.30 again
1615880000,Yesterday we were saying the same thing about 2.75
1615880074,This was before btc absolutely shitting up
1615880096,You sure that btc will stop dropping? :p
1615880162,you know i get liq at 2.10
1615880164,so im gucci
1615880173,its impossible to fall that much
1615880242,People acting like btc falling this much is end of the world lol. It fell more than this 20 odd days ago
1615880324,no one cares about btc @seven eleven
1615880333,we care about the alts
1615880341,you know bc of price fall and all
1615880355,Just be in ADA and don’t worry bout da fall m8
1615880412,Too early to tell. Looks slightly hopeful but we need more
1615880429,You should care about BTC because BTC moves the market
1615880522,yeah i know
1615880527,3k loss yesterday auwtch
1615880528,i mean btc as a investment coin
1615880539,i just leave it there to be but i keep track on it
1615880724,It is possible
1615880743,If btc commits suicide
1615880817,i mean a 20% reduction on BTC would be pretty crazy
1615881219,"anyone bought Verasity from that post grads call? I threw $100 in, was meant to do it yesterday but got tied up with work and saw it was heading south at deposit time, held off but now it went from 0.011-0,012 yesterday to 0.017-0.018 today (50% increase!)"
1615881259,bought at 0.01736ish this morning
1615881548,Ok. How D duck I get to post grad for calls ?;). Get on Twitter ... then what ? I don’t have any followers or following lol
1615881558,I need those 50% calls lol
1615881728,Futures is a drug
1615881768,That’s I need to learn about.
1615881774,"they're not all short term calls. e.g. Lukso - I threw $800 in there (my Casper reserves waiting for the ICO to open), but 4 days later I'm down to $600 value now.... suppose I leave it in there medium term"
1615881779,Someone show me the ropes lol
1615881807,I banned myself the other day after losing 2k
1615881810,🤔
1615881830,Guess what? I'm back 😭
1615881843,Sounds concerning 🤣
1615881864,"I'm ready to learn/play with futures with my $27 I transferred in yesterday. I guess I need to make sure I select 'isolated' to make sure it doesn't take from my spot account, right?"
1615881919,We need step buy step “how to”
1615881936,Man major props to ada for not breaking 1 buck during all of this
1615881967,I put a buy at 0.99 fell asleep hoping but not a chance hava
1615882030,Brought 100 dollars on a 30x of ENJ at 2.43183 now to wait till it hits 3.0
1615882247,going to try a eye out for BTC if that PoS starts dumping again and enj is in the green I might exit
1615882271,"nothing to do with twitter, just invite I think 15 people to this chan"
1615882304,Good morning who got the text from Binance last night
1615882309,I didn't
1615882317,Lucky lucky
1615882332,what did it say?
1615882342,*we've cleared your account*?
1615882343,“Ya got liquidated son”
1615882355,i managed to half asleep put a 100 bucks into enj. 1 cent away from my new liquidation point. 😫  if I didn't decide to do i would of been liquidated now
1615882369,Jesus what a call
1615882458,"i fell asleep for like 15-30 minutes and dreamed myself sitting at my computer ""it wasnt enough"" woke up and grabbed my phone and sleepily went like ""uuuuuuuuurgh um futures URGH BINANCE APP YOU AND YOUR DAMN NETWORK TIMEOUTS fine um 100 bucks more in enj."""
1615882475,Nice and lucky haha
1615882496,Hope to see it pop above 3.0 today again
1615882526,"Who's liquid, whos not?"
1615882536,I'm not atm
1615882549,I'm a solid
1615882590,Brought enjin on the big boy dip
1615882649,Currently up 240 percent
1615882658,i am solid
1615882660,also

1615882663,ooooh
1615882672,I'm heavy into CHZ.  Birdie told me partnership with dodgers is coming soon.
1615882682,also
1615882691,how the fuck is this 24K a year
1615882747,made 15 bucks on a MANA long in 10 minutes after waking up
1615882749,good start
1615882910,Probelm@I don’t know anyone who would want to join. 1 person maybe.  Other than that no one even know o got in to crypto
1615882924,Look at chz in last 20mins 🔥
1615883069,"Okay,I think it's safe to assume we've broken the downswing and are on our way up again with Bitcoin. Probably another good re-entry between 55k and 56k coming up"
1615883111,Are you liquid?
1615883120,:kekw: it better be before I shoot BTC in this kneecaps
1615883125,ADA doin somethin
1615883132,i think its shortable at the top of this spike
1615883147,if it hits high 1.0x or 1.1x
1615883152,I always assumed it was more about the market access than the actual Bloomberg terminal hard- and software
1615883172,no. I fell asleep dreamed of me going not enough woke up and dropped liq to 2.33. enj hit 2.34 before going back to current rate. so nope. EXTREMELY CLOSE too close but not liquidated
1615883184,phew
1615883200,"🤣 
If thats not a 'Fuck BTC', i dont know what is."
1615883352,my prophecy dreams strike again. :kekw:
1615883456,hey @felguerr did you ever use these before? :godsgardener:
1615883498,"high 1.05x is where im gonna short ada for a little bit, high margin but smaller size i think"
1615883509,"maybe if theres a large green candle, i could get away with 1.06x"
1615883517,"@SeineJanie Is we make 2 assumptions: 1) This fall aint over and 2) BTC needs to touch ATH of 75k by April end, what are we looking at seeing now?"
1615883545,i used up my last bucks to drop liquidation to 2.2036 no fucking way that is getting hit
1615883574,when BTC is stable and uptrend and ENJ is stable hovering around 2.8 im gonna pull out the margin I added and go back to 2.45ish
1615883584,man the worst thing is calling the dip perfectly but only getting paritally filled
1615883610,the 5% that got filled is up 20% already LMAO
1615883770,but now I know. when @reqularhd says hey there is a shit ton of BTC moving downtrend coming. pay fucking attention
1615883789,I think we could get back again too

1615887277,I thought it wouldnt dip below 2.63 but daamn it did. At least managed to salvage something back this morning buying at 2.47
1615887298,Btc has too much negative influence on market
1615887300,HOT is pumping now!
1615887350,ENJ is showing good signs right now though.. it could just start its way towards 2.8 again
1615887902,Is it though?
1615887932,I would have been +1500 dollar on ENJ right now
1615887933,arf

1615888081,And leverage?
1615888103,*50 I assume looking at the percentage :p
1615888202,What is your opinion on Chiliz (CHZ) in the next days ?
1615888234,"I'm assuming it'll probably see a boost due to the Dodgers partnership. But then again, just my two cents."
1615888249,ENJ broke 2.8

1615890367,Looking to buy another Stack
1615890382,Guys I highly recommend doing future with between 10 to 20$
1615890393,Less chance of pain
1615890393,So I hope it dips a bit once again and then shoots up
1615890395,And its taking a healthy risk
1615890398,enj? how do i do it?
1615890405,Yes
1615890410,I used enj
1615890413,Made good profit

1615890630,"The fact ENJ recovered last night makes me so sad, if I just had put £20 more into my margin, I would have been okay 😭"
1615890670,Its curious i predicted the downfall 10 mins before and a lot of ppl joined the train in those 10 mins

1615891323,I wanted to buy that Orbz thing yesterday when it was .20

1615891678,😂 😂 😂
1615891741,Has anyone had issues with depositing to binance today or is that just my end?
1615891884,like that it takes long?
1615892195,"Spitting out an error saying this transaction can’t happen, check that your card details are correct - I haven’t changed anything and that’s the same card I’ve used for previous deposits, card details are the same 🤔"

1615893212,"@Kyle What time was Kanye's last message, do u know?"
1615893347,@SeineJanie Dazz and i have a theory on why BTC fell like his
1615893358,"This is not over yet, it looks like we are in for another dip which may even go further down than the last one."
1615893407,@Cryptoknight my theory
1615893431,Ours is better and more likely
1615893466,Someone let kayne into the enjin discord 🤣
1615893573,"Yeah. BTC started falling a while back yesterday, but that started affecting ENJ only when Kanye entered after asking us. I said yes to him. I take full responsibility for this disaster. Sorry guys. Will be more careful next time"
1615893599,Will ENJ pump again soon?
1615893611,More than likely
1615893619,"Karma can be a bitch, and i played chicken with it yewsterday i realise now."
1615893621,Probably but it may dump at first
1615893632,When they ban his stupid questions and theories
1615893643,Hahahahah
1615893679,This is why i hate when BTC reaches an ATH
1615893684,"He may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I think he behaved well last night."
1615893696,it drips 2% below that and every normie and his dog thinks its gonna crash and then alt coins fall by 15%.
1615893696,And when kanye comes in too
1615893700,Kanye learnt his lesson from trolling and I for one thought he was good last night
1615893707,This
1615893709,You haven't been in the enjin room
1615893732,"He was, really good actually. But karma doesnt forget."
1615893734,"I've been here all the time, isn't this the enjin room?"

1615897589,"But not to 1,8"
1615897600,Lol. No
1615897602,Maybe I should have opened that vet position in isolated margin
1615897610,Did it not give you one 😂
1615897653,They call that a lucky dip
1615897660,hows XEM looking?
1615897671,Always
1615897673,🤔
1615897808,@bcdcdaz was it a bad idea to keep my VET in my spot instead of margin trading it? I wanna stay away from it at the moment haha
1615897884,"@David R. just a big advice, you should keep your strat and position otherwise you stay at the same point and see the train passing"
1615897890,You asked me few days ago
1615897905,I told to have both VET and ENJ
1615897914,And if you entered early
1615897917,Keep them
1615897923,Dont go to margin or leverage
1615897930,If you want to play
1615897937,"Ah yes, thank you man ❤️"
1615897941,Take money like 100$ and play with it
1615897948,But keep at least some for long
1615897954,Dont jump
1615897958,It is a bad idea
1615897977,"Yeah margin is risky and if you just hodl, will make more long term with less risk"
1615898006,"Amazing advise thank you so much, I feel like I’m really annoying with my questions, I’m tryna learn and I hope I’m not pissing people off in the process, I’m a slow learner :p"
1615898021,No pb 😉😉
1615898048,Excuse my english maybe i look to straight to the point but it doesnt mean that your questions are stupid
1615898062,I dont have the correct word maybe
1615898071,🙏🏽 sorry for that
1615898071,Bo your spot on swiss
1615898076,No*
1615898084,"Absolutely not. You are asking good questions and learn from the answers, and other people who are following this chat can lesen as well. That's how it's supposed to be."
1615898112,Only people who never learn and keep repeating the same (stupid) questions are annoying.
1615898144,Totally
1615898318,"But i dont know about all of you guys it seems that you are making a lot of money thanks to leverage. 
I am bit worry cuz i dont see any holders strat like more than a month.
But ok if you think you are ok with risk it is cool. Just to let you know that from experience there is not only one way to win. A lot are doing both holding and trading. So dont forget that. Fibo are usefull to enter in some long term coin that you miss when it is blood day."
1615898369,I love this community man ❤️
1615898370,im holding 40% of pf since like month and half ago
1615898393,You can have 70% ENJ secured in your long term bag since the very beginning and play with 30% in leverage assuming the risk and take profit to feed your long term
1615898393,I lost a lot on futures
1615898398,"kinda bad decision to put that much money on futures, lost most profits"
1615898408,"I prefer holding @felguerr - I’m not experienced enough to play around with leverage, I think those who do can make good amount of money quickly:)"
1615898414,
1615898416,But I'm back to futures
1615898429,It's an addiction
1615898436,Futures is addiction
1615898444,If someone ask me
1615898450,I wont recommend it
1615898454,@bcdcdaz did you see that other countries are talking to VET about implementing the same passport thing

1615900648,I might throw in 2k on enj
1615900657,They at least know what you dont and are informed well. They normally share good TA and great calls. You just have to be carefull and dyor
1615900813,Are you going to put this in the Podium channel?
1615900857,If you wouldnt mind swiss ?

1615902804,"more like that, slightly slower"

1615905804,not an email
1615905850,I'm hoping to hold ENJ now till it hits 3.0 hopefully itll get there again today
1615905863,what is your short term btc prediction chat?
1615905909,I am looking for a nice short opportunity
1615905938,I will let you know when I buy something
1615905943,then you can short it
1615905948,:))
1615905980,honestly its looking like BTC is recovering right now but you prob should have shorted yesterday when it was hard core dipping. lots of great short opportunities then. Luckily it wasnt the first time and will for sure not be the last that btc crashes
1615906003,Today most coins will be recovering though so you'd be more profitable longing
1615906038,wanna scalp altcoins but i am too afraid of a random btc crash which could ruin my fun

1615906581,I know people. Lots of people. Some needed surgery
1615906608,Apparently its a very humbling experience
1615906619,can you go both long and short on the one coin at the same (like have 2 active positions)
1615906638,"You cant, and what exactly would that achieve?"
1615906673,"right before a breakout, you could take out 2 positions, and just close the one that isnt in the right direction"
1615906694,You can change direction anyway even if you have a single position. Same effect.
1615906721,Bad idea tho. Once you commit. Either stay on or get out. Otherwise you will panic
1615906942,You can Hedge using two different positions but its honestly not as useful as hedging on stock options
1615906953,They even have built in hedging on binance
1615907015,"Ill be honest, I dont even remember where I saw the hedge option at but I know Binance has it"
1615907120,yea i cant find it

1615907263,How much?
1615907280,2.9 at most ?
1615907298,Try $29 at least
1615907313,that's the dream
1615907313,I mean for short term bro lol
1615907325,I have sell orders for 50% at $40. Just FYI. So does Dazz
1615907326,
1615907335,Short term $10 should be fine
1615907355,Ahh okay
1615907359,I think it will go down first. This W wasnt what i thought it would be
1615907381,its keeping to the traingle pretty well i would think
1615907381,I thought it was gonna hit 2.9 and dip off down abit again
1615907386,Not sure tho. Still a lot of BTC crap happeing
1615907425,Short term 10€ holy fuck you guys are confident
1615907438,"Not 2.9, maybe 3.16. BTC will crash when it hits 3.16, but this time, our floor will be much higher"
1615907447,"Sorry for the question, but what am I looking at here? what's that intersection? Not the most trading-savvy person tbh"
1615907452,Ahh okay
1615907455,Thanks man
1615907463,if it keeps within those 2 blue lines
1615907472,you can expect a breakout where it meets
1615907475,It wont i think. Look at BTC again
1615907500,Oh lol. U mean the BB?
1615907501,thank you very much for the exp!
1615907508,Yeah I'm in on a stupid levvy but I'm trying to hold lol
1615907519,you can predict the breakout the direction using a number of factors
1615907531,its pretty reasonable to assume that enj will go up
1615907539,but not guaranteed
1615907560,"Ur sayign this because of the direction of the triangle on ENJ, instead, look at BTC"
1615907576,Is btc looking like its dropping
1615907610,im not sure what ur seeing with btc
1615907639,Zoom out to 1 hr. Its forming a pattern.

1615907718,looks like standard btc stuff
1615907794,
1615907819,whats up with the penis
1615907866,I love to imagine Cryptoknight at his company doing this all day
1615907867,that doesnt look like it should affects enj's triangle tbh
1615907908,Like not even working regularly anymore. Just focusing on ENJ all day and then going home
1615907919,Look at the graph. Not the dick 😆

1615911169,"Yes, in less than 20 minutes"
1615911179,Those tokens are only for country teams
1615911189,"This looks fairly realistic to be honest, will be interesting to see if it’ll go as low as you predict though"
1615911192,The normal country teams don’t exist as tokens
1615911196,i think 2.4 is the absolute low it could go to within the next day or 2
1615911208,2.44 ish
1615911221,if it drops below that id be really suprised

1615913873,sky pumps basically once every 3 days or so
1615913882,Its literally like clock work
1615913903,that is not a ENJ waifu
1615913905,see the news above for sky @Jeremyfto
1615913929,"Pumped today, pumped the 13th, pumped the 9th, pumped the 7th, pumped the 6th, pumped the 3rd"
1615913947,quickly we need to sexualize ENJ for massive pomp
1615913952,It literally gets P&Ded every 3 days. The pumps vary in sizes
1615913973,That might actually work
1615913974,"but it happens so often, you can almost put it on a calendar"
1615914036,
1615914052,
1615914068,every event grows enjin massively
1615914070,"LYM look like it's going to PUMP to, what do you think @bcdcdaz"
1615914072,i don't think my long will survive until end this year
1615914124,"conversion to NFT token LMT, this friday, integrating with BSC"
1615914131,+ AMA today
1615914210,https://coinmarketcal.com/en/news/3-coins-to-keep-an-eye-on-issue-102 this was written about enjin in november

1615914603,It isn't
1615914616,where was it announced that ada will be listed on coinbase?
1615914619,superior ada taking away from enj :kekw:
1615914626,
1615914631,Ada booooum
1615914633,@vibitrary Twitter I believe
1615914649,I even had a ADA long yesterday that I sold for the ENJ long 😂
1615914652,man I should of closed and done a X20 on ada like I hoped
1615914657,I’m so happy rn 🙂 is it worth just holding or selling now to rebuy at a lower price?
1615914661,Good ole life pulling a 180
1615914663,What’s a good entry on Ada atm?
1615914673,what DOES happen when a coin goes live in coinbase historically speaking
1615914676,Ten minutes ago
1615914676,dump after listing?
1615914677,No moveeeee
1615914679,I mean it'll only go up when it does get listed
1615914681,
1615914685,MATIC did not
1615914686,No where near here. Its either going through the roof or failing. This is NOT a good spot to enter
1615914689,nobody cares about coineal
1615914693,"As in, I just sit where I am and relax? 😂"
1615914708,:godsgardener: my long and small ada bag is comfy
1615914713,The time to buy low has passed now
1615914714,If you own it right now then its great but like you should not be entering ADA right now. Its extremely dangerous
1615914719,Why would you want sell
1615914728,🙏🏻
1615914730,because people see short term gains and go AWW YEAH
1615914740,> me xd
1615914747,@felguerr coinbase listing is a great thing for ada in terms of legitimacy right?
1615914757,Honestly IF I owned ada still Id HODL it till at least thurday release
1615914760,see how that goes
1615914760,Dont think so
1615914769,It may spike it up higher
1615914770,I mean i didnt care either it is or not
1615914789,So has it actually been released on coinbase then?
1615914792,Cuz if ada able to deliver phase 3 whatever about exchange
1615914796,Or just announced to be released 🤔
1615914798,It 🚀
1615914803,coinbase pro in 2 days normal coinbase whenever
1615914813,Ah sound thank you
1615914841,Thursday is the time to figure out your exit point if you own it. It may be great to exit then or it may be great to hold longer. Just depends on what the release does
1615914847,Any coins that at great longterm holds?
1615914858,AaaaAAaaaaa  (insert screaming cowboy meme)
1615914867,Why are you doing this ENJ
1615914869,"nano, ada, unfi, and whatever"
1615914893,chsb
1615914898,@That one belgian super cunt i heard about ENJ free money i am waiting tips now
1615914921,Right before doge blew up it got listed on crypto.com
1615914922,"If the release sparks it up quite high, is that a good indication to get the fuck out and not wait until regular coinbase lists it?"
1615914929,
1615914979,Me a hour ago lol
1615914982,DOGE blew up because of WSB hype campaign and elon shill musk
1615915002,"Thats a personal decision on if you think its going to hold its value. Its of course going dump if it pumps but if you think its going to not dump too hard when it corrects, then it would be a good hold for longer than the release date"
1615915026,I personally dont do long term positions so its not something I would be interested in
1615915034,"not saying its wrong to do, its just not something I do"
1615915038,I personally believe ada will go 2 dorrars
1615915043,or above eventually
1615915058,I think you are right
1615915077,"Perfect, I originally planned when buying ADA and a couple of other coins that I’ll hold onto them for a while - I don’t wanna regret it by taking it out with a small profit and then end up loosing out long term, so I think I’m gonna stay in :p"
1615915118,in the end ADA is by a good team with good plans in long term there is no reason why it can't do good
1615915147,"Long term, you mean like a week?! 🤪"
1615915149,Hey @bcdcdaz  is your chart showing for enjin that it might drop to 2.50?
1615915160,"I’m only holding 60 ADA so idk why I’m getting so excited, but small profit is always nice to see"
1615915183,😫 finaly
1615915189,I got 1400 ada
1615915196,That’s a lot 😮
1615915196,Cmoon ENJ just give me break even so i can close my position
1615915211,Basically for crypto 😂
1615915219,So ADA is announced on coinbase tomorrow?
1615915226,Ah man i should of 5 X margined ada yesterday. But noooo enj has to be a shitcoin
1615915229,No ADA is coming out thursday
1615915235,And take up all my time
1615915245,Wwll thats an early prepump than😆
1615915252,https://www.slowmist.com/en/security-audit-certificate.html?id=08e4d39884dcc9c2160a9b74835c94c08fc511536095c2ae9a63116c299fd958 The labs group property deal
1615915256,whats happening to ada?
1615915257,The announcement came 20 minutes ago
1615915263,everyone is filling their bags before the release
1615915264,"well, it was announced so of course itd jump"
1615915290,This morning I transferred 500 dollar to my wallet to leverage Ada
1615915296,And I did ENJ lol
1615915306,thats alot of money
1615915306,And hit my stop loss 10min later
1615915311,And then it mooned
1615915312,Who?
1615915317,think of them ada gains
1615915317,Fml :’)
1615915330,"Wow, were you 50x ENJ?"
1615915335,And the ENJ gains if I didn’t hit it lol
1615915340,Me? Yes
1615915361,I should of 50X'd ada and just increased margin to comfy levels. :kekw:
1615915379,"enjin lab groups, lusd stablecoin etc"
1615915381,I knew i should just believed in my shill coin
1615915422,about to jump into an ENJ long with 50x
1615915435,Almost liquidated on ENJ noooo
1615915441,"Ada for life. I had a bag of it aswell, but it stalled a lot so i decided to invest in something else while it sleeps"
1615915448,And here we are
1615915454,ENJ
1615915476,Ya I sold my ADA for ENJ last night
1615915482,Unlucky
1615915514,Enj still going down
1615915517,Holy fuck
1615915531,ya ENJ is prob going to continue dipping for at least today
1615915533,Whens it gonna end the miserybhahah
1615915538,ADA is getting all the hype rn
1615915540,Got to laugh - 1 small pullback and 2 youtube streamers flagging the end of the bull run ... MMCrypto and BitBoy ... jeez
1615915557,Got home from work
1615915561,What happened to ada?
1615915565,Please tell me
1615915565,Bit boys a cock anyway
1615915566,My FIL bag ❤️ near 60$ a FIL
1615915597,A little bit longer and i am going to just dump this shitcoin :kekw:
1615915604,It’ll probably die down in a couple of hours lol
1615915617,100% agree - last pullback he was like Chicken Little ... the sky is falling in ... how he has so many followers is beyond me
1615915620,"You buy the high and the news
I am buying the low and hold #
True story bros"
1615915629,That doesnt necessarily mean ENJ will recover
1615915664,"Did you say you have a position in ENJ right now? Haven’t been reading all the chats, :c"
1615915665,Yeah he just chats out his arse someone found his liquidation price on btc and when it was going down they all banded together to short and make him liquidate lol
1615915667,enjin always recovers
1615915668,"Need scalpers tips, need proof that your strat will make money"
1615915670,1 big group
1615915680,Send me !!!!!
1615915681,just bagged 65 ada
1615915687,Hard to moan about a little dip when it has gone up over 300% in a month
1615915689,Your fockin short term
1615915698,With leverage
1615915703,Send send send send
1615915707,Depends on if your leveraged or not 🤷‍♂️
1615915712,liquidation is a thing
1615915723,thats the risk innit
1615915725,Yep
1615915733,Extra profit for extra risk
1615915733,Wish I had transferred my ADA into ENJ after ADA pumped ... would have been well up now
1615915766,when the coin moves even slightly different to what you think it will with margin
1615915769,you lose pretty big
1615915769,I thought we were doing this for fun :p
1615915772,All those are talking about high risk for making profit are the ones who never worked in financial sector or bank
1615915775,Which goes back to a important topic: Do not leverage what you aren't willing to lose
1615915778,True - didn't realise people were actually trading it in reality - I get cold sweats trading ETH as that is so volatile ... ENJ is a whole new level of brass balls!!!
1615915797,high risk low reward
1615915800,this is the way
1615915807,Honestly do not put money in crypto in general what you are not willing to lose
1615915810,Betting money on derivatives means betting on manipulate world
1615915822,do not invest money you are willing to lose
1615915825,in anything
1615915830,Spot is a bit different
1615915831,A coin can crash. Your money can empty; Dont put your rent money in crypto
1615915832,also do not make investment ur main source of income
1615915837,(if you can help it)
1615915872,love how dazz and enjineer aren't here while its burning
1615915876,maybe post another rocket gif
1615915881,This is not completely true
1615915881,another graph with 50 circles
1615915881,last msg was rocket
1615915882,I brought back into enj
1615915886,Fuck it
1615915888,2.47
1615915907,If you are very rich you can live off investments
1615915911,@That one belgian super cunt still waiting entry price for leverage
1615915930,2.25
1615915930,ok ill reword
1615915942,dont make investment income something you *need* to depend on
1615915949,where them ada shorters at?
1615915950,That’s better
1615915968,eh I am losing now
1615915974,says me - the person currently depending on investment income
1615915978,but my SYL and Casper investments will make me win
1615915979,probably
1615915998,both will be solid imo
1615916023,Ada hype caused by what?
1615916029,It’s not normal
1615916030,listing on coinbase annoiunced
1615916047,🥳
1615916048,still on point
1615916052,Ok thanks
1615916070,1 cent above my liquidation. :kekw:
1615916078,It will go lower
1615916088,shoot me
1615916094,🔫
1615916095,Hahaha
1615916096,"No need to, ENJ will"
1615916105,we are almost at the base of the triangle
1615916110,Enjs coming for you with no lube
1615916111,So coinbase listing+the conference+full decentralization= more hype coming
1615916133,https://tenor.com/view/goofy-trial-crazy-evil-ill-fucking-do-it-again-gif-17111514
1615916137,Where was your triangle @raven 🥚  for reference
1615916145,me when I get liquidated
1615916151,ill redo it
1615916151,probably
1615916155,I swear my futures wallet hates me
1615916165,probably not do a fucking X50 again :kekw:
1615916167,Thanks sorry
1615916173,Ill make it a shit ton one day and then lose it all the next
1615916185,your futures wallet is abused every day
1615916196,I always end up close to my 0% PNL mark by the end of the month
1615916197,
1615916201,Futres are there to take an absolute beating
1615916204,it broke through
1615916205,abort
1615916209,even though Ill go -300% and +300% in a week
1615916242,Sometimes I feel like futures is like gambling with extra steps 😂
1615916245,Choo choo enj train
1615916273,wish I hadn't sold my ADA 😦
1615916284,You and me both 😂
1615916285,Enj coping train
1615916289,hey daz where are you:kekw:
1615916289,ENJ hates me :p
1615916291,copium
1615916293,🤷‍♂️ what can you do
1615916303,time to rechart
1615916306,@bcdcdaz
1615916309,maybe I should buy some Doge and wait for Coinbase to finally list it
1615916331,So how’s ENJ going guys
1615916333,It's already on robinhood
1615916336,Is there an enjin addicts anonymous club meeting here because I think I need it
1615916337,That's where most people are buying imo
1615916349,what point should i dump my ada hmmm
1615916352,"You can learn a lot about life through pump and dumps. Some days you are the pump, other days you are the dump, but you can be damn sure that someone is rigging the game in their favor"
1615916358,"ADA has done a jump like today's on Feb. 10th, but that day hat 3x the trading volume of what today has so far"
1615916359,My ada position is greeeeeen
1615916359,@That one belgian super cunt having flashbacks?
1615916362,Yeahhhhh
1615916365,Lesgoooo
1615916368,isn't robinhood that scam exchange  that tried to stop people from buying GME stock?
1615916376,yup
1615916377,Yes
1615916379,succeeded in
1615916380,and everyone jumped away from it
1615916397,Partially succeeded. It has come for a second round
1615916402,i know
1615916403,im in
1615916406,Im not in it but Im surprised about it
1615916409,i wish i could use robinhood
1615916414,You really think it's going to hit 2.25
1615916415,and do a walls street bets move
1615916417,Enj
1615916426,has anyone tried binance options ?
1615916430,like options options
1615916446,what are the options?
1615916446,You mean the futures?
1615916452,no i mean options
1615916459,theres an options section in futures
1615916462,So guys ENJ huh
1615916463,man thinking i could have been out at 2.94 but i was asleep lol
1615916464,not going at all :kekw:
1615916464,Nope lol
1615916478,shitcoin until it goes back up
1615916478,Correction it’s only going down x x
1615916486,yknow what the worst thing is
1615916487,like i said yesterday
1615916488,Burger had a breakout too
1615916490,https://tenor.com/view/trash-garbage-dump-gif-12550739
1615916493,looking good
1615916494,i almost clicked short at 2.9 earlier
1615916511,i had the order set and everything
1615916513,I hope dazz is ok
1615916514,I haven't but I dont intend to. Setting up a trade that has to be locked for a certain amount of time seems risky as fuck with crypto
1615916517,i just didnt actually create the order
1615916517,I hope 2.4 is the ultimate bottomline
1615916522,yall seen that video of that WSB shorting apple and losing like 40K in one second
1615916526,I think it's the dip here for ENJ
1615916530,in his car on his phone
1615916533,https://tenor.com/view/bogdanoff-dump-it-stocks-crypto-gif-20477588
1615916547,That was me in inverse with ADA
1615916553,THis was foretold. Dazz said 2.4
1615916553,and when the market opens and it instantly goes -40K and he makes the noise of his soul leaving him
1615916555,"could be, but it could also be 2.3 or even a bit lower"
1615916569,i think it depends on what they let you buy in terms of options
1615916571,LETS PARTY!!!!
1615916584,i think year long calls on btc for example
1615916587,sound really call
1615916594,il make a call right now
1615916597,I had to add money to avoid liquidation 😦
1615916601,BTC in 5 years 150K
1615916606,I have a SYL bag 🙂 hopefully will get Casper too and Yes please May it become Best investment ever 🙂
1615916608,2 years
1615916626,I got liquidated as fuck. I had no added margin to my ADA position and it still went to -248% before disappearing because of how fast it happened
1615916637,it was even green before it did that too 😂
1615916642,are you ENJoying your evening guys?
1615916645,i saw that
1615916657,Not yet but we were promised a mooning now
1615916665,I feel alive atleast
1615916666,LOVING THE FUCK OUT OF IT!!! THIS IS BRILLIANT!!!!
1615916677,Ugh I just can’t resist the ENJ bashing after the contest the past year it feels
1615916682,Tonight I can cry myself to sleep again
1615916683,that sounds like the screams of a man coping
1615916686,"is this going to be a full moon, a half moon, or a eclipse?"
1615916696,an ass moon
1615916697,me right now
1615916703,"Yes, coping with my 2 year old yelloing Night night! Night night. And i dont want to miss this"
1615916704,Coinbase pamp
1615916705,Same though!!!
1615916711,confused rollercoaster since my ada is up
1615916713,Just another second monday of the week
1615916717,Differences between ada and adaup?
1615916723,The fuck happened here
1615916724,adaup is betting its gonna go up
1615916733,when it goes up adaup increases in value
1615916744,think of it has having a multiplier
1615916751,adaup will go up more when ada goes up
1615916755,then ada will
1615916755,i like how my fucking futures is -384% and binance is like
1615916758,10% risk
1615916779,Have you hit your ENJ liq yet
1615916782,no
1615916786,my liq is 2.203
1615916787,like you can see that adaup is up by 30%
1615916794,ada is not up by 30%
1615916803,ada is up 15%
1615916803,A the end of the day
1615916811,@IllegalSkillsException get these guys to the minor ENJuries clinic
1615916811,Enj was just a big dump
1615916842,Can we go shill ENJ to other discords to pump it again?
1615916849,ENJ is a scam coin made by people who eat whales
1615916850,If this world would be fair
1615916854,ada should be sitting at 0.70$
1615916855,Facts
1615916856,OH MY GOD JAPAN EATS WHALES IT ALL MAKES SELL
1615916857,sorry guys
1615916859,but truth
1615916861,SENSE
1615916863,I should add more money with a lower leverage right?
1615916867,nihongo eated the whales
1615916867,Damn stupid
1615916867,ENJ will no doubt pump again but it’s just a matter of when
1615916883,im gonna ENJect them some medicine and they will get better
1615916902,"Two men ENJer, one man leaves"
1615916926,NOW THIS is the ENJ content I don’t mind
1615916942,I am staying until i get kicked out
1615916944,if that happens
1615916946,"wait, you are ENJoying this?"
1615916955,I will spam the GREATEST and AMAZING fury on enj
1615916959,be there. dont miss it
1615916964,I’m very much ENJoying it
1615916964,damn
1615916970,if i had of adctually pressed sell
1615916975,id be up over 800%
1615916977,Why is this discord group the only one hyping ENJ what did I miss
1615916984,pain
1615916993,Lots of pain
1615916997,that would be over 1 grand in 2 days
1615917002,"Okaayy so finally accept that we will reduce to two coin over 8500, ADA and ENJ"
1615917011,👌🏽👏🏽
1615917016,because we got one guy here who is a near conspiracy theorist fanboy who is new to crypto and found one good coin and now is a guru and one guy who has joined his cult
1615917023,@felguerr any thoughts on enj rn?
1615917028,🤣🤣🤣
1615917029,hey swiss
1615917031,ENJ or ETH
1615917032,We can send you 100 articles to read
1615917043,:kekw:
1615917049,Wait i give a call to ENJ CEO
1615917052,meanwhile
1615917053,CHSB
1615917054,comfy
1615917056,nice
1615917057,stable
1615917057,No need. Did anyone make money from it
1615917059,buy CHSB
1615917063,That’s all I need to know
1615917067,Yes
1615917071,buy superior swiss coding. not japanese gaymer coin
1615917071,2.47 after seeing 2.42 feels so good
1615917075,It’s just a test of ENJurance
1615917083,"From 0,79 to 3.08"
1615917089,Nice
1615917104,Not that I was in it all the time but ok
1615917115,ENJ IS GOING BACK UP NOW I LOVE ENJ AGAIN
1615917118,💎🙌
1615917122,huge gains on ENJ
1615917123,Got ENJ at 0.2  so... yes
1615917132,jeeeesus
1615917146,Short how much X?
1615917149,"It'll go down slightly faster after this green candle, if that even stays green. Don't get excited yet"
1615917152,Ada?
1615917170,I say we need a shill channel
1615917170,longed about 20x at 2.43
1615917175,where we can just spam hype coins
1615917181,All leveraging ENJ as mad men lol
1615917183,while this will be left for good old crypto talk
1615917185,What is this
1615917185,"It all well ripping on those guys about ENJ but when they started their crusade 2 weeks ago, ENJ was at 0.79 and they championed holding it for the long term not margin or futures trading it.  I’m $1,000 dollars up on it since 2 weeks ago and if it dips a bit fine, my hands aren’t made of paper"
1615917212,I have fucking DIAMOND balls at this point
1615917229,"Didn't you get liquidated already, or first in 30 minutes?"
1615917231,I have ABSOLUTE faith enj will go 3 dollars and beyond.
1615917238,I have been in for two days now
1615917244,on a 50X
1615917245,long
1615917248,and I am still not liquidated
1615917252,diamond balls confirmed
1615917261,I was at a loss of 600 bucks
1615917262,It’s a very pretty upward chart if everyone just zooms out a bit
1615917264,and I am still here
1615917288,Hold on brother
1615917293,I’m buying Enj
1615917294,because as much as I will jab at @Cryptoknight and @bcdcdaz I KNOW it will go back up
1615917300,Why risk on ENJ WHEN YOU CAN SHORT ALICE?
1615917302,Just bought 300$ more
1615917307,ITS GOING BACK DOWN SHIT COIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
1615917309,And i’ll buy more
1615917313,Alice? Who the fuck is Alice
1615917315,kk i am done
1615917315,Shorting alice is good
1615917317,As it goes down
1615917318,alice is your mom
1615917344,i wonder if ADA will get an new ATH
1615917347,You can do long term future trades with it being profitable. I held ETH for a week between its 1400->1800$ phase
1615917365,ah the jeremy and his ETH long was such a saga in this server
1615917368,it was amazing.
1615917373,the suspense. the drama
1615917376,the betrayal
1615917376,"Once you get far enough from your liq price or add enough money to your margin, futures can be a long term thing"
1615917384,And it's still on
1615917390,
1615917392,2000 on the way
1615917405,I don’t know if I should close my ada position or if I should wait
1615917406,he isn't in eth
1615917408,THIS
1615917418,"listing is in 2 days, cant wait till listing lmao"
1615917418,I fucking LOVED
1615917420,his ETH
1615917424,saga.
1615917428,"Missed my point I think, the people who are panicking on ENJ are not the holders, it’s not a short term coin, firstly it’s not very stable and very unpredictable in these early days"
1615917429,jeremy long eth again we miss it
1615917454,Yes but you underhandedly gave off the idea you cant do futures long term by stating that they didnt
1615917471,You 100% can do futures long term. Spot trading isnt the only way to go about long term positions
1615917480,I could do a XRP X10 or X20 and add enough margin to a point its unlikely to liquidate
1615917513,swiss has faith in XRP so I have faith. he is/was a in the banking sector and since XRP is a banking coin and he still stans for it I will trust it
1615917517,Want a hug? Glad ur converted. Now sell allthe other shit coins u have and buy enj.NFA
1615917518,2x leverages are amazing for long term holds because it requires a 50% drop from entry to liquidate
1615917537,GIVE ME ABOVE 2.59
1615917559,Lol.no.were going straight to the moon now.
1615917563,Wasn’t my intention so sorry you misinterpreted.  This wasn’t about strictly Futures trading I was making the point that ENJ is doing incredibly well ( just not today )
1615917600,B U Y G O O D C O I N S
1615917605,believe in the system
1615917612,Makesure u close ur position at the top of the peak post 3.0please. let's not do this again.
1615917632,It wasn't a misinterpretation but nice job trying to gas light. You stating that they avoided utilizing leverage directly correlated with a negative idea of leverage trading and I explained why thoroughly
1615917636,It never reached 3
1615917641,since the 2.3
1615917649,"**IF** ENJ starts going up again now, it will be like a clockwork precisely at the time daz said it would. Just saying."
1615917652,"If you want a long saga, long xrp at 0.4"
1615917658,"Well if it wasn’t my intention, it’s a misinterpretation no?"
1615917672,"Ofcourse.lol.why would it. Had it reached 3 then, it would have gone down to 2 by now."
1615917687,that’s not how crypto works
1615917693,A misinterpretation is an issue of the reader. A misrepresentation is a issue of the writer
1615917701,it reached 2.91 and went to 2.42
1615917705,"I would be happy with 2.55 
Minimal loss and could potentially buy back in"
1615917720,"Ok well agree on misrepresentation, my apology still stands"
1615917720,"Also, everyone,just saying, yesterday,Kanye's presence made btc fall. He's back.go figure. Enj is on its own now."
1615917736,kanye is cursed
1615917740,kanye talk about another coin
1615917742,Super cursed
1615917743,lets see if it crashes
1615917744,Lol
1615917750,Lol.talk about ada
1615917754,N O
1615917754,Apology accepted 🙂 I'm primarily just trying to keep people from being afraid of leverage because its very useful once you understand how to use it
1615917756,Well ada is doing surprisingly good
1615917764,Ok.talk aboutsoge
1615917764,No it's not
1615917766,Doge
1615917770,*opens binance app to look at ada percentages*
1615917774,Talk about luna
1615917778,i think we can agree that high leverage is not for long term plays
1615917782,Lol. Go go go
1615917782,Im buying enj at 2.31
1615917783,Ada to be good has to go to 2
1615917783,What's the worst that can happen with ADA XD
1615917786,What he should of said
1615917795,I disagree bro you can say that but we will talk about it in post grad chan 😉
1615917797,The last coins listed on coinbase rose a lot when they became tradable right?
1615917812,except in extremely rare cases like that one time ETH went to 10c
1615917813,No
1615917816,Leverage is amazing.
1615917819,Wtf
1615917820,Coinbase sucks
1615917820,then you can 1000000000x leverage
1615917823,"You only get to do that if I am right. It could also be that the lowest price is now (if daz is right, which is more likely)."
1615917826,and become rich
1615917826,Appreciate that and I’m primarily just trying to get people to not write off a coin based on a small fall compared to its growth in a 2 week period
1615917830,Wish I could
1615917833,On enj
1615917842,Coinbase doesn’t even have a good base of coins
1615917843,Don't bet on Enj
1615917853,moron a 0.00000001% drop would liquidate you :kekw:
1615917858,Hold but don't go allin
1615917875,so guys
1615917878,real question
1615917879,digibyte
1615917881,they still alive?
1615917886,"actually, 20 bucks into ETH at 10c during that time, to now, would be 18mil"
1615917892,Oh I 100% agree. I hate coin base tbh; They charge way too much on fees
1615917894,because EVERY SINGLE GIF ABOUT CRYPTO IS FUCKING WITH DIGIBYTE ON IT AND ITS ANNOYING
1615917902,It's enj.i know everything about it to be able to avoid it.
1615917912,A proof that an ENJ supporter doesn't even know how it works
1615917916,remember when you told me enj would never hit 2.4 again
1615917920,"I think if we did, anyone like  @bcdcdaz who comes in with a lot of buzz for a coin, some well thought out arguments and links to valuable news on it will simply get written off as a hype guy/Shiller again"
1615917922,never
1615917926,ENJ is a pump and dump coin
1615917928,only moon now :kekw:
1615917936,you are literally seeing it rn going down again
1615917947,I'm blocking you again
1615917948,"Btc hadn't fallen the way it had. I know enj, not btc.btc can go fuck Kanye's mom"
1615917967,Lol.that was harsh.sry
1615917968,btc isn't crashing right now and ENJ is still dumping
1615917972,Run little enj!!
1615917978,They hated Jesus because he told them the truth
1615917980,That's normal. We call it the revv
1615917991,Can we crucify u?
1615918003,Looking at 4h chart on ENJ lowest it could go is around 2.2
1615918014,you're more like Caiaphas
1615918015,Fucking below liquidation point
1615918016,@Drahnreb you seeing ENJ? Isn’t that exactly what Dazz predicted? 😂
1615918026,"Look at Alice, ENJ neighbor"
1615918033,Good boy.now ur catching on. Welcome to the enj team
1615918039,the ENJ dip is making me :p
1615918040,"Precise to the minute, if that what we are seeing now is a viable uptrend"
1615918051,what did dazz predict
1615918061,ada mooning
1615918065,"If that is a short, get out now"
1615918066,Makin what? 50?
1615918070,I sure fucking hope it is
1615918075,Exactly what happening rn
1615918075,"That’s crazy accurate, wow.. is that the power of TA’s?"
1615918079,Dazz is a god.
1615918082,yes can i see the prediction
1615918084,i cant find it
1615918086,Its 6pm gmt and ENJ is rising.... I love you DAZZ
1615918093,HOLY FUCKING SHIT
1615918099,he DID say 6PM would be rise
1615918105,"yeah 50$ on 100$ approx, not big gain but sure some gains"
1615918105,@bcdcdaz is a fucking god!!! Everyone who doubted him are Judith!
1615918108,:kekw:

1615918144,Grinich
1615918145,Somewhere in the world
1615918161,Put your faith in yee who predictus thee fortunes.
1615918163,"It is. That's what I'm trying to learn. Mine was spot on for 4 hours, but where I assumed a change in direction (towards going a little steeper down) it actually started going up. Probably. Let's wait and see."
1615918164,Grinish?
1615918175,In that case keep it 🙂
1615918198,Uk time? The 0th meridian
1615918204,"Ur ignoring a few things in the middle. But still quite close. Also, ur new to the enj train so don't understand the patterns yet."
1615918221,.give it time. We have another $37 to go
1615918226,That's not grinish dumb dumb
1615918233,At 6pm according to NL tine i was doubting him
1615918237,"Congrats on that spot on 4 hour prediction, you could make a little profit selling at those peaks and buying at those dips! You’re gonna be a pro"
1615918259,"Next time, when I'm not holding a big red bag :kekw:"
1615918260,*puts in 2K in margin so he will never liquidate*
1615918264,He doesn't do that. Wants only honest money. Not money that tramples over people while getting.
1615918274,Greenwich
1615918279,Boohoo grammar nazi
1615918293,Hahahaha hahaha. Is that what he was trying to say???
1615918300,I don't consider shorts to be dirty money. It's not my fault if stuff is going down.
1615918324,That's the same as saying that no point is not polluting the environment cause everyone else is
1615918333,what is enj at right now?
1615918339,2.8
1615918343,kk im driving home

1615918410,"Congratulations. Ur still in jail for littering. After this btc drop and the 10x tightening of your asshole, you'll soon be Kanye"
1615918415,"Going to make dinner now, I hope to get to come back to green numbers. 😄"
1615918430,"Huh u have a hate boner for me, weird"
1615918432,So that is what happened to him? Poor chap 😦
1615918459,Nah. Ur growing on me. Seriously. NO MORE MUTE PLEASE FOR KANYE
1615918460,you were talking yesterday and suddenly the market super crashed so he thinks you are cursed now

1615918646,you nut and then the phone gets the binance notification
1615918655,Well  thats unfortunate. Hope she's ok.
1615918732,"Imagine getting liquidation during sex. First the coin, then the boner. That's how the funniest sex stories are born. Please share if they haopen"

1615920027,
1615920049,12.8 enjin gets a lil pump
1615920200,"Hypothetically, (excluding ENJ from this question lol) would longing ADA a few hours before the coinbase pro listing be a horrible idea? I’m not likely to do it, but seeing the increase with just the announcement, the actual listing could also have a pump for some short profits? Sorry if this is seen as an unethical theory, just speculating 🙂"
1615920237,it will pump big
1615920257,"I think you'll do good if you hold it for longer than that, because smart contracts is (allegedly) just around the corner"
1615920288,🤣
1615920297,Is the same price as 12 hrs ago
1615920315,Guys.. great ADA rise and ENJ stumble ( temporary)  any thhought on buying  some XRP ( yes there is a court.. but there is life outside US and Canada) and SKL coin. thank u in advance for ur bright thoughts 🙂
1615920321,Def a god idea
1615920339,When is the listing?
1615920340,Is that /s or genuine xD
1615920344,Thursday I believe

1615920501,Its not doomed. Might do well actually in the long run maybe kinda
1615920518,But why? Why would you waste time on it?
1615920526,When you have ENJ!
1615920546,Could have guessed that was gonna be plugged lol
1615920548,i am gonna buy enji for the game release to ride the inital pump wave
1615920627,can people sleep when they have a leverage active
1615920629,damn
1615920653,"If they’re comfortable with their liq price, I suppose they could"
1615920664,"As long as you put your stop losses and stuff properly, and are fine with losing the money, you may sleep"
1615920664,Confident* probably a better word
1615920691,"Like yesterday, i slept like a baby. Woke up to liquidation tho"
1615920775,2.36 is by far a comfortable margin lol
1615920990,is it too late to ride the ada wave?
1615921062,No idea. It could keep pumping up to listing and have a new bottom higher than the 1.02 it was trading at
1615921180,Ada on bloomber terminals. Coinbase listing. Man its good to have an ada bag
1615921194,If it does drop back down to 1.02 i am buying more
1615921195,@That one belgian super cunt do you feel a bit better now hehe
1615921199,After the ENJ drops
1615921407,you would just get to the top of the mountain
1615921415,atm
1615921426,in 2 days we'll see what happens
1615921482,it gets listed tomorrow on bittrex right?
1615921496,It’s getting listed on coinbase and if I’m not mistaken also on another exchange.. on the 18th/19th there’s a conference where they could be announcing something related to the Africa deal
1615921503,Enj?
1615921529,On the 31st it goes full decentralized
1615921541,So the next 15 days are hot
1615921552,I don’t expect it to go to 1.02 again
1615921553,What? Enj or ada
1615921555,1.22 could be the new low 👀
1615921556,Ada
1615921577,So if you see 1.10 you may want to buy in
1615921587,ye
1615921597,expect we fall to 1.10 at least
1615921601,i'd say
1615921621,Have you thought about longing ADA just before the listing on coinbase pro?
1615921634,Just wondering
1615921638,I have a long open for ada
1615921653,Opened 15 days ago
1615921669,I was down 1.5k.. now I’m breakeven
1615921681,I’m not selling yet
1615921686,2 green hour candles on ENJ i feel a bit better now
1615921687,I expect some sort of hype
1615921714,"I will loose some weight sweating like this, and im relatively skinny"
1615921716,And if something good comes out of that conference it might go up
1615921744,Could be huge for you man 🤞🏻
1615921759,I got in at 1.05 on a long. :kekw:
1615921760,I have 4k invested there
1615921768,Maaan
1615921768,I deserve some returns
1615921771,Envious
1615921782,I’ve been down for 2 weeks
1615921882,Also when this happens (2 weeks where a coin always goes down) the paper hands sell
1615921896,Meaning a lot of people want to get back in
1615921954,I mean enj is free money then
1615921962,Just buy now and wait till the 19
1615922038,What happens on the 19th?
1615922158,the 18th ends
1615922165,its also 1 day away from the 20th
1615922186,The game comes
1615922212,Kayne are you serious or did you misunderstand ?
1615922223,The 18th is for ada
1615922226,Not for enj
1615922259,Or maybe you were jokin
1615922267,Im a post grad man
1615922276,This is why i deserve the role

1615924625,no my hustling hard lol
1615924642,Haha
1615924702,@Cryptoknight u never explained what limit does?
1615924705,On stop limit
1615924718,That was lovely news to wake up to for ADA
1615924732,The 18th is going to be a great day!
1615924760,I am just going to keep my long on ada running.
1615924764,RIP I sold my Ada at 1.08 after the first peak 😂😂
1615924777,"Price is the price at the bottom ou want to keep. So in this case, 2.4

Stop is the price at which the order is activated (2.56)

Limit is the price at which order is executed (2.58) (same as limit buy)"
1615924783,Whats happening to ada?
1615924783,At Least I bought at 1$ but still
1615924788,Oh damn it mooned
1615924792,Why did it moon?
1615924796,Coin base listing on Thursday
1615924800,How did it look
1615924802,Moon
1615924815,It went up some cents
1615924830,https://tenor.com/view/mighty-boosh-moon-face-funny-gif-16873317
1615924836,How moon looked
1615924838,How did they just give this news out?!? 💀💀
1615924845,Today you were able to move your ADA to coin base. Then on the 18th you also have the Africa blockchain conference where Charles is speaking. If any news occurs it’s going up
1615924856,Damn I wish I bought 50x at 1$
1615924897,All Exchange prices are linked right?
1615924898,I can’t send the link but look at Charles hoskinson Twitter
1615924900,I will defo
1615924900,Hindsight is always 2020
1615924917,Thanks ❤️
1615924938,To be fair I’ve been warning you guys about the conference for the past 2-3 days. The coin base listing was unexpected
1615924969,@SeineJanie are all crypto prices the same on all exchanges?
1615924988,Tbh i don’t see why this Africa conference would be important at all
1615924995,it is close but there is a slight discrepancy depending on liquidity of the exchange
1615925004,"I mean is africa, there is no money to invest in normal things, let alone crypto"
1615925012,So when price moons
1615925020,It moons for everyone 👍🏿
1615925020,If Charles releases any news regarding their Africa deals then it’s pretty big for adoption purposes
1615925029,No. Little lakes. https://cointelegraph.com/news/professional-traders-need-a-global-crypto-sea-not-hundreds-of-lakes
1615925035,Ur so slow 💀
1615925043,Explain then
1615925059,Most countries in Africa can’t even support their own population
1615925066,How are they even gonna invest on crypto
1615925075,africa is probs the biggest actual users of crypto rn
1615925084,So u live and witness day to day life in africa?
1615925089,This
1615925090,"their dollar too unstable, so they use btc"
1615925093,😂😂
1615925099,Kanye
1615925106,where do they use btc then?
1615925106,Crypto was almost built for africa
1615925108,"Haven’t got time to explain fully, but essentially they are the biggest potential market at the moment"
1615925111,between each other?
1615925115,yup
1615925120,It was supposed to help african countries have a solution for inflation
1615925125,And other issues
1615925133,"No, but i unlike you study it and the countries conforming it. My god al least if u are so slow check the poverty rates/infrastructure of the main african cities"
1615925144,"think about like marketplaces, they P2P pay vendors like that, business deals are also thru btc because the naira is so unstable"
1615925145,sounds like a hassle
1615925154,getting your btc to your bank account each time
1615925158,to actually use it :p
1615925167,"I live in africa, so what ur saying is absurd 😭"
1615925184,"Its like all u know about africa, is what u see in CNN and youtube"
1615925184,Which country? I suppose sudafrica
1615925186,south afrika doesnt count
1615925190,thats like europe :p
1615925205,"No, you have no idea. Let us white westeners tell you how it **really** is 😄"
1615925212,"dont need to get btc to ur bank, just use your btc yafeel"
1615925214,but it makes sense to replace western union
1615925220,"Is called historical books and talking with actual embassies, but u do u 🙂"
1615925231,btc yafeel?
1615925244,i dont sense yafeelin
1615925249,"Smart “white” and “black” investors love africa, theyre bringing their bags of money for investments cause they are smart as fuck and see africa as the new growing playground to make money"
1615925273,Come check out all the new high ride apartments and holiday spots constantly being built by rich white and blxk people
1615925279,In most african countries
1615925288,Africa is mostly owned by Europe thx for their lend leases of money
1615925292,Kanye stop taking what u see on CNN and believing it fully
1615925303,True
1615925314,Loans
1615925337,All kinda of “aid” contracts
1615925343,Proof of the corrupt politicians from africa by selling their lands to europe for mineral explotation
1615925344,Are fucking african countries
1615925355,Never got email from african prince 🤴 offering millions ??
1615925356,Very true
1615925393,You dont know anything about anything. So dissapointing
1615925393,"I mean those buildings are nice, let’s see in about 30/40 years when the resources run out how many of those buildings stay up"
1615925414,Resources arent gonna run out and if they do
1615925418,Price goes up
1615925421,thats only Congo Kayne
1615925424,And africans become more rich
1615925424,"Dude, no one is talking to you, stop entering all my convos if i don’t speak to you. So annoying"
1615925426,I'm pretty sure that China is now fucking Africa right?
1615925434,Semi
1615925440,Only the high class tho
1615925450,“Helping” and taking advantage in some of their deals
1615925454,I fucking hate China so much
1615925456,True
1615925458,Thats only what the government wants you to think. The truth is we ran out of oxygen years ago. Right now we are running off the emergency reserve
1615925461,Modern imperialism
1615925464,Africa aint listening to you. If they were you'd be under an elephant rn.
1615925479,"i mean im supposing u live in Sudafrica, since is the only country on Africa that is at least somewhat modern thx to uk"
1615925482,WTF
1615925495,Have enough family there to know.

1615926353,"@felguerr 4 figure profits on enj, 50x 👀👀 or 5 👀"
1615926359,I think we have another one coming in a day or 2
1615926362,"Say it with me, kids: 👏🏻Cryp👏🏻to 👏🏻on👏🏻ly!"
1615926375,How much did y put?
1615926388,4$
1615926389,I put 100 on a 50x
1615926389,A sack full
1615926396,ENJ only
1615926404,On Enj
1615926404,Really???
1615926404,Enj?!?
1615926410,Yeah
1615926411,360 on 20x here
1615926415,feeling the pressure to sell :p
1615926415,Bro
1615926420,I turned 0.69$ into 5$ the other day 50xing lol
1615926422,What
1615926423,WHY! You're losing shitloads
1615926428,and then I lost it all
1615926431,422 on 69
1615926441,Lol
1615926450,I made 500 this morning when it hit 2.9 and I'm doing it again hopefully now lol
1615926455,Ouch. Im at +$962 thanks to futures on ENJ
1615926475,Now sell it all and go buy 962 big macs
1615926477,this is the way
1615926500,No. i keep holding $150 out of whatever i make in futures and buy spot ENJ with the balance. Im ENJ only
1615926513,thats still 811 big macs
1615926526,Thats unfortunate. $BIG and $MAC always be going up when I buy
1615926529,I dont like apple
1615926543,I think Im gonna do another long position with ENJ
1615926544,I mean tbh i don’t see Enj reaching $5 till December at least
1615926563,Right now? A bit risky
1615926572,Thats what they said about you too. But look at you now. Worth a full dollar
1615926576,Im gonna wait for it to dip a bit
1615926593,im in no rush to get back in
1615926608,"Hope this dude gets warned the same way i did, but whatever"
1615926615,but I do want back in at some point to ride until 3$
1615926643,You dont de-shill and create panic for no reason man. Makes no sense to do that
1615926669,Jesus the sexual tension with you two is unbearable
1615926671,Kayne more like lame
1615926691,if you are jealous just DM me
1615926718,"The warn was for continuing non crypto related conversations after we told you enough times to take it to frat. If he talks about non crypto, he will get the same warning"
1615926732,Don‘t
1615926744,Ok srry
1615926772,https://youtube.com/c/EnjinTV
1615926824,With the way LUNA is going rn what do you reckon would be a good entry point?
1615926862,👀
1615926874,Can we talk about crypto
1615926881,We are
1615926882,ENJ only
1615926885,VET is doing wonders
1615926889,As my prediction
1615926893,Months ago
1615926895,FUCK! This is awesome!
1615926896,Yeah kicking myself
1615926901,a/s/l bb
1615926906,Should be hitting coinbase public soon
1615926917,My whole portfolio is doing wonders🙏🙏

1615926921,Vet isnt on coinbase?! 👀
1615926934,Today is a sideways day for me :/
1615926957,Were these advertised today after the drop or something?
1615926967,No idea
1615927010,Anyone used the KuCoin Trading Bot?
1615927017,https://youtu.be/RSZBw7OKOtQ this one is fucking fire tho
1615927029,Share this
1615927045,Yeah. this is awesome too
1615927169,Luna prob in a couple of hours is a good entry point
1615927178,I guess my question is how do these items get balanced for each game they're in
1615927179,anyone had luck with the pumps?
1615927270,They're valued at 1k enj now
1615927328,"that's how much they cost to create, however much 1k enjin is when they sell is how much they will be worth"
1615927340,Any predictions on how far will ENJ recover?
1615927354,Its climbing rather slow compared to previous times
1615927365,"I mean, if the items are transferable across different games how is it itemized in each game?"
1615927378,I'm intrigued by the concept just not really understanding the implementation in the real world
1615927382,Anyone looks at atom?
1615927384,"Well, in the real world of gaming"
1615927397,How much do you think it’ll b
1615927531,I have 2 staked for 10%
1615927561,they will be colossal mid to long
1615927563,imo
1615927579,Every new CryptoTab user will get Cloud.Boost X2 for free! write me for the link
1615927634,What’s a good VET entry price
1615927637,It swaps through the enjin wallet to anywhere at a constant value of 1 k enjin
1615927657,!warn @Dano no advertising
1615927658,
1615927664,long hold any
1615927696,Was this a reply to me
1615927696,vet are now doing covid vaccine passports for numerous countries
1615927697,Is the enjin amount equivalent to an items power? I haven't read enough about enjin to be fair.
1615927788,It depends entirely on how many enjin were backed into it on creation and how many of the items are in existence already
1615927810,www.enjin.io tells you most things
1615928109,oof ada went off last night
1615928128,b r u h
1615928214,7 cents or below
1615928221,7 cents is safe tho
1615928351,wtf was with the massive ada spike
1615928381,20% in 40mins 😐
1615928391,Its making a comeback
1615928396,"Enj Vet comparison 24hr, both returning to growth now imo"
1615928433,coinbase listing announced
1615928461,Ada will fall probably to 1.18 I think
1615928481,"I’ve been holding a bag for a while jumped up a few weeks back but dropped when BTC did a couple of weeks ago and has been going between 18-22 since.
I stake it though and add a couple more coins each month to the bag"
1615928525,
1615928539,"aah, thatd doit"
1615928545,Vet and Enj are bullish right?
1615928561,Can do whatever it wants before coinbase trading starts on it tbh
1615928572,enjin $5 next few days bullish
1615928597,Hopefully more people stake via coinbase as well
1615928635,I think $4 test is more realistic for now
1615928646,I mean it's still not comfortable with $3 either..
1615928653,ENJ $50000 tomorrow afternoon
1615928656,Bet on it
1615928658,
1615928688,"Feb 16,2021 is when I bought 30 ATOM"
1615928694,Am gud investir

1615928705,hodl strong
1615928717,I bought more at $18 so the DCA makes it a little better
1615928778,"It broke out today, let's see if goes to the moon soon"
1615928815,Yes enj
1615928820,Drop to my buy position
1615928838,"But it quickly retreated, it tends to just be sitting between 18-22"
1615928844,Get into ENJ below $50 and it’s still a deal
1615928851,where is your buying position?
1615928880,2.39$
1615928890,phew
1615928892,damn
1615928899,I will have a heart attack then
1615928904,my liquidation is 2.36
1615928933,Are all you maniacs trading on margin
1615928948,it keeps me busy :p
1615928948,I hope it gets to 2.36
1615928952,Good lord
1615928956,and its fun
1615928958,That would be a fat bag for me if it hits 2.9 again
1615928964,I’m so happy Binance.US doesn’t let me trade on margin
1615928971,Yes
1615928971,I’d blow every bit of profit I’ve ever made
1615928977,Good exercise for the heat
1615928985,That happens
1615928999,2.9? damn
1615929005,can you stay in that long 😂
1615929030,I need to get out before I go to sleep
1615929049,Who tf keeps pumping BAT
1615929064,Get free BAT just by using Brave browser tf is wrong w people
1615929064,The moment you short ENJ it will go to new ath
1615929081,Enj moving slowly to
1615929086,2.7
1615929090,Hopwfully
1615929099,"Margin is boring. Futures, man!"
1615929117,We don’t have futures on Binance.US either 😢
1615929132,Vpn?!?
1615929133,America sucks
1615929141,Yeah I ain’t risking that shit.
1615929155,Heard of too many people getting their account closed for VPN
1615929174,"I set 2.5 as stop loss. Will sell 50%
Otherwise i wont sleep"
1615929185,"Dude, why is that actually? Can't participate in ICOs, limited Binance ... land of the free much?"
1615929192,Way too high
1615929208,good quetion. after i sold it 0.35 😦
1615929212,Now that Trump is gone is sucks a little less tho tbh 😉
1615929222,Yeah I honestly don’t know. Binance seems so much cooler than Binance.US. My guess would be something to do with our bullshit tax structure
1615929238,Thats the point it will be a mininal loss but i wont survive another heart attack if it drops below 2.3
1615929312,"> Binance.US is available in 41 US states—41 more states than Binance. This month, it added support for Alaska and North Carolina. But it is not supported in the following states: Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New York, Texas, Vermont and Washington. 
Woooooow...."
1615929317,Trump was better for the crypto market right?
1615929331,That was COVID
1615929336,Yeah the US is way behind on crypto lol
1615929383,It may also have something to do with the fact that Binance and Binance.US are run by two different companies
1615929402,Trump was better for the economy

1615929422,Great crypto bags
1615929431,"waxp, hard I mentioned earlier and umb"
1615929443,It was Covid man.
1615929447,check out the article
1615929449,You like getting Hard?
1615929455,😏
1615929460,Stimulus check is good for crypto
1615929461,Dont you?
1615929469,😏😏😏
1615929470,What exchanges do you guys use?
1615929471,My pf makes me hard
1615929485,Thats because of covid right?
1615929493,Yes
1615929506,When this next round of stimulus comes in I’ve talked my wife into letting me dump most of ours into the market.
1615929517,Gonna lose every penny
1615929517,when i wake up and see 2 6hr enjin green dildos everyday
1615929517,"Binance, SwissBorg, KuCoin, bitcoin.de ... 😉"
1615929530,"Wait, so technically, Biden should be increasing the cheque size now."
1615929553,How so?
1615929571,"Will create inflation, people lose money in usd. They will be looking for other ways to keep valuta —> crypto"
1615929581,https://cryptowat.ch/charts/BINANCE:ENJ-USDT?period=30m best app/site in the crypto game
1615929589,Biden is too busy giving billions to shit hole countries for social studies :kekw:
1615929591,Also more $ for € 😻
1615929607,It's not billions
1615929613,Stim cheques are really a democratic thing arent they? Privatisation/republicanism doesnt really agree with that concept as far as i understand it.
1615929617,"The money is coming from selling bonds, not just printing money. There will be inflation but not to the degree everyone seems to think."
1615929635,"Not very good for the economy, but they have to do something. Doing nothing is also bad.."
1615929656,"stim checks is to make ppl happy, and help those that desperately need it"
1615929666,"Yes. They believe you should always pull yourself up by your own bootstraps and if you're too weak to survive a crisis or have a major health issue, you should go bankrupt."
1615929671,I got it worked out now
1615929679,Nazis! Yay!
1615929684,"I don’t see why that would increase the amount though. And to be honest the initial amount isn’t enough for the people that need it. I think it was calculated based on minimum wage earnings for a month, and with only three checks being distributed over the course of a year, you do the math."
1615929684,lol
1615929687,Enjin games are like the Matrix
1615929695,"Sure, but people will lose trust in usd"
1615929699,Either way
1615929705,It's supposed to boost spending
1615929711,Crypto for global currency!
1615929720,"Sure, but minimum wage is also basis inflation. Inflation is at 9% post trumps departure. Hence, higher stim cheques"
1615929721,everything co-exists as one but none of it is real
1615929729,"Please, Mr. Fed. Make $$$ machine  go brrrrrrr so our cryptos will moon!"
1615929736,Welcome to the Matrix
1615929743,I can tell you aren’t from here. You’re trying too apply to much logic to the situation.
1615929746,Not global currency i think. But it can probably come to the same level in the future
1615929751,enjins just chilling atm
1615929752,"I mean, getting a stim cheque and using it on crypto. And then blamming that usd is falling is pretty ironic"
1615929752,start a change.org
1615929759,You are literally part of the problem
1615929760,We dont have stim cheques here 😩
1615929780,"Fuck the USD. It’s worthless besides being used as the global reserve currency. It loses that, it crashes."
1615929783,Enj still being shit i see
1615929788,"the usd is supposed to move the economy, not to be sent to a exchange house in Lithuania"
1615929793,Well they wont put it in crypto
1615929803,"We neither. We have Kurzarbeit, though. Which is the government pays up to 80% of your salary if they company doesn't lay you off."
1615929810,"Get me a meeting with Biden, I can pursade him to buy Enjin"
1615929811,Mine is going straight to CZ 🙏
1615929811,They put money in crypto when they lose trust
1615929819,Have faith. Have a sandwich. Have a faith sandwich.
1615929820,"The USD isn’t backed by anything. They can just print more. In fact, they literally did last year."
1615929841,Oh yeah. One of the many reasons i like Mercel.
1615929852,"Neither do we. We don't need any though. Every person who lost their income due to covid is taken care of, and most businesses also receive financial support. No need for separate payments, especially in form of a cheque. 😄"
1615929853,He can guys
1615929863,Next time I stream I'm gonna suggest he buy some to make all the covid cash back
1615929876,What's good for Lithuania is good for EU. And what's good for EU is good for Germany. 🙂
1615929883,make it go viral
1615929895,Theres no point. He will see your stream. And forget which room he is in 5 mins later.
1615929897,Is she the one that invented the Merceldes? 😄
1615929900,Poor guy will be spammed with enj links:kekw: :kekw:
1615929917,Do you think he has used a PC before?
1615929924,Lol. Phone thinks thats the correct spelling
1615929942,Angela Merkel
1615929948,Not if I have kids on stream (full attention please Mr President)
1615929953,She’s a fierce woman.

1615930010,Invest in enjin and you can then afford x amount of children
1615930022,So much for my 'Biden has dementia' joke. Jesus guys
1615930089,Please only crypto talk here
1615930091,man enj really went down huh
1615930101,over 12 hours is only still falling
1615930107,"from 2,90 to 2,50"
1615930112,Only healthy
1615930113,and stagnant for over 3 hours
1615930132,ENJ will be fine!!! JESUS!
1615930210,Show me another coin as stable as this after such growth
1615930232,"Hey, ENJ went down"
1615930253,"enj is probably doom btw, dead coin"
1615930257,Does my uniswap portfolio count?
1615930261,"can't break 2,65 lol"
1615930264,can I partially close a position?
1615930269,or is it everything
1615930277,"ENJ is beyond dead, Idk anyone with sense that would still be invested in it"
1615930289,A rocket also has to drop its shit before it can fly up full speed
1615930293,See this is blasphemous
1615930311,You should sell. Get out of ENJ now.
1615930318,So what I’m hearing is ENJ just has to take a really big poo
1615930328,yes I will buy them
1615930332,🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♂️
1615930333,Yeah. Waiting for you and Kayne to exit.
1615930333,"ENJ is a dead coin, the only game they have is so boring to play"
1615930333,Yes
1615930338,and it looks like i made the game
1615930351,"full of bugs, boring mechanics, 2x2 map"
1615930354,That's what the little box to the right of the limit price is. The amount you're closing
1615930358,same gameplay over and over again
1615930363,ok good
1615930372,will my liquidation remain the same?
1615930375,they have over 35 and also partner with unity
1615930389,@SeineJanie Do you think that Kayne and BuffWand should exit ENJ? (say yes)
1615930392,research
1615930394,Y’all must not know why Kanye got made a senior
1615930398,yes

1615930669,Xelo gave him that
1615930675,I sold mine 2 hours ago.......
1615930752,Xelo gave it to him for trolling the fuck out of #🍆frat-chat
1615930755,same here.. probably post grads only where we cant get in
1615930794,It is senior alerts
1615930796,"OH, sorry! Didn't see you are a Sophomore... my deuteranomaly makes it hard to distinguish the colors for Sophomores and Seniors."
1615930807,It literally says senior alerts
1615930831,I dont like that name tbh. Makes me feel really old for some reason.
1615930842,Get this man a life alert
1615930845,🚨
1615930851,"If you're a young senior at college tho, you should be proud"

1615930888,RIP
1615930889,go to the gym
1615930905,I do
1615930924,But
1615930931,"Thoughts on Ada, buy time?"
1615930947,Buy time was any time in the last week and a half
1615930955,no
1615930957,
1615930960,I would wait until tomorrow to see if ADA cools down a bit
1615931042,"Has anyone here tried doing a future on a coin that is pumped? Like not on the way up, on the way down"
1615931065,Thats risky
1615931075,"I tried, but the coins that get pumped tend to not have futures 😦"
1615931081,the ENJ lair
1615931085,BAT was just pumped
1615931097,Haha
1615931104,Pump coins have small mc. Those dont have futures indeed
1615931105,"You're one step ahead of me. I've been considering to get a dedicated Binance screen above my main screen, but didn't take the step yet."
1615931124,LOL bat lets go thats actual poggers
1615931141,ENJ is just doing nothing atm lol
1615931142,See that monitor on the right thats switched off? Wanted to use that as the binance screen. Cant find the damn adaptor
1615931153,I sold my Bat 2 hours ago missed the whole pump🙃
1615931160,It is. Its consolidating
1615931186,"If it is a pump by an actual shitty pump group, shouldn't it be pretty safe?"
1615931211,To fit it on top of the screen? I'll just print one
1615931214,
1615931219,Nah man im still waiting on that second wave
1615931241,"So think of this. When the pump happens. We have a thin line of how high it went. When the price is at 3/4th of that, put a Short order at the top. If it hits, great! If it doesnt, next time."
1615931255,This would work no?
1615931284,Maybe just a bit under the last ATH bcs there are shorters
1615931284,CoinBaseCoin?
1615931299,"Oh yeah, and bots"
1615931312,coinbase shares on the stock market
1615931318,WTF
1615931323,Thats cheating
1615931346,If the sec accept and they're allowed to go public
1615931352,Pumps are done
1615931371,Dumb?
1615931380,No done
1615931382,No more
1615931386,At least not bps
1615931391,Wow. Hope so
1615931406,The rest wasnt really relevant anyway
1615931461,bps ran
1615931468,Wheres WSB?
1615931496,"my friends and I were speculating how often they started doing pumps as if they were squeezing the last bit of juice before they dip, and they did exactly that."
1615931506,amazing. I bet they're fat rich enjoying their lives.
1615931531,Wsb is only relevant with their collab pump
1615931531,I bought a bot. Now pumps are dune/dumb
1615931566,
1615931569,And how is that working for you?
1615931589,Where would i use it?
1615931603,
1615931620,"Also, Dazz will disown me if i participate in another pump"
1615931636,Make that money
1615931639,🔮
1615931645,
1615931656,Almost there?
1615931664,"close, I like"

1615931765,I'd prefer that
1615931790,No no. Im serious. Thats the general pattern. Thats why we all miss the peak most of the time.
1615931803,Or me atleast. Lol
1615931820,I forgot to consider time zones. Within those arcs are the awakening of Japan and the awakening of Europe
1615931833,Oh I thought you did.
1615931838,MA 99 and MA 9 touching with candles sandwiched in between
1615931840,cmon matic
1615931855,it’s auto matic dude
1615931858,Just trust
1615931864,"Japan starts trading within the first arc, so we'll probably see significantly more movement there"
1615931880,hell ye
1615931883,Thats still in another 2 hours tho
1615931895,We'll should see some movement before that i hope
1615931906,"but if Japan gives ENJ a little nudge, the European traders could pick that up and amplify it a few hours later"
1615931923,then americans wake up and sit on it
1615931926,They dont need to. Its automatic
1615932137,"when ppl wake up and log into the games, they update the earned interest (enjin) and update the servers, Enjin goes up"

1615932462,I only use LTC to move balance from one exchange to the other 😄 😄 😄

1615932639,Yea
1615932641,On ocean?
1615932647,yea
1615932672,"Do you believe they will be of value in the future, like will they add something?"
1615932673,Just wanted some more opinions from ppl that probably know more lol
1615932703,"for sure, im all in for RSR for example"
1615932707,great project
1615932725,"Dont know how much money you have to spend, so it is hard deciding what is a safe bet for you"
1615932747,What do you see ocean doing/becoming?
1615932892,GO LITTLE ENJ GO
1615932959,I need to go to sleep
1615932962,what do I do now
1615932974,close my position or leave it open
1615932981,"I wont do any specific price predictions, but i truly believe in Ocean and i can see it being implemented in corporate level and governance. Tbh, ocean is my fav alt"
1615933002,I dont think this will be its highest price
1615933171,set S/L
1615933186,preferrably one in profit and not too close to current price
1615933237,I just closed it
1615933240,80% profit

1615933470,"best in a dip, if there is a dip"
1615933481,everything looks like a dip man
1615933484,nobody knows right
1615933523,Not LIT. If you had access to #🎓post-grads-podium (Sophomore or higher) you'd seen my call 😉
1615933550,"CHSB, also in the green"
1615933557,quite unfortunate
1615933570,I will shill my dmst on this one
1615933589,Pumping at ath for 6 5 days now
1615933671,why is it a good buy?
1615933736,What bot?
1615933767,"I had to close my LIT last night around that spot, realising a loss of around 200 $, to protect my ENJ from liquidation 😦"
1615933831,I didn't advise cross leverage ...
1615933848,Or you mean you sold LIT on spot to have more margin for ENJ futures pos?
1615933957,"I meant what I wrote, and with isolated leverage it would have been gone much sooner. The mistake I made was that I did not think further than to the buy button when you made the call. I bought when you said it would be a good time to take profits, so the fault is entirely on my side (and the fault wasn't the margin). 🙄"
1615933979,"I had to sell because I had 4 positions eating up margin simultaneously, pressing the liq point for each of them up"
1615934027,"Dude ... I did a 3x margin on LIT. That's a pretty safe bet, even in turbulent times. How much leverage did you apply?"
1615934147,"Ehm, I wish to not answer that question. 😅 Previously my major mistake with post grad calls was going in with too little"
1615934175,Pump and Dump bot. Nothing like what @Morkle has tho
1615934197,That's okay. Yeah... now you joined the party late and sold the dip :-]
1615934199,"I did make some money with LIT earlier though (thanks to your call), by scalping a bit here and there"
1615934207,Love Enjin I do @Cryptoknight @Alanox
1615934215,so I guess my real LIT-loss is just around 100$ or so
1615934230,"Normally I never sell the dip, but this time I had to. 😦"
1615934266,Too late. I already married it
1615934284,Cheating bitch
1615934300,My future play money for enjin
1615934309,HEY! Thats my wifenj you're talking about!!!
1615934339,"Doubt it I was inside her before you, Ride or die"
1615934344,"Come on, ENJ is big enough to cater to several husbands and wifes"
1615934358,Can she cater to me rn for more or am I too late
1615934372,I kinda want to get rid of my ENJ now 👀
1615934380,She will make all very wealthy
1615934391,"Yeah, but i got her pregnant. Beat that."
1615934402,Can you two stop being fucking weird

1615934442,most guys clearly sexually frustrated here... too much trading :kekw:
1615934446,He's just jealous.
1615934446,Enj is like trailor trash. Looks nice at a party but is rotten and smelly when taken home.
1615934461,:kekw:
1615934470,Did I miss anything in the last few hours? 😮
1615934480,Kick her out and she runs off with another rich man
1615934481,Mostly banter tbh
1615934481,TAKE THAT BACK YOU BTC HUMPER
1615934485,Why didnt u just add more margin?!?! Even on isolated?
1615934491,Daz and Crypto went from shilling ENJ to simping
1615934494,Or u put ur life savings 🤣
1615934498,And didnt have extra?
1615934501,JOKES ON YOU I HATE BTC
1615934509,Tether is my real love
1615934514,Ok. We're friends again then
1615934531,JESUS!!??! 😟
1615934531,"I think that’s a benefit to the channel not gonna lie, need a break from ENJ sometimes 😅"
1615934557,"Read that again, this is not a break from ENJ. It's rather the opposite"
1615934571,DAVID!!! HEY BRO! Wanna join the orgy?
1615934575,Oh boy
1615934580,Back to warzone
1615934586,Ada is still green. Bnb looks like its finally going green. ENJ still red.
1615934601,BNB is not done falling IMO
1615934601,Friendship died with enj ada is now my best friend.
1615934632,🤣🤣😭
1615934637,Bnb doesnt really fall unless btc does or big negative about binance happens like when people anticipated big bnb news
1615934655,my only joy today is  ADa back to waht i got it for so almost green. and CHSB is green.. the rest is  blooody marry lol  my 200 ENJ now down  red. red doest suit it.
1615934686,Bro
1615934694,How did we get rid of slp shill
1615934705,And not cryptoknight
1615934706,BTC is definately not done falling. Will go up and fall again most likely. Would be strange if it didnt
1615934722,Cryptoknight shilled the shit out of enj until all the actives vougyt into it 🤣🤣
1615934728,The power of shilling
1615934735,And you're all welcome!
1615934744,Biatch!
1615934745,Couple more days of slp shill and we wouldve jumped on the slp train 💀🤣
1615934761,Lol everybody regrets buying into it
1615934778,Nah. Not the same thing. ENJ had a lot more going for it even regardless of us. We just brought it to the fore
1615934786,The time all join the party is when it goes red
1615934796,Does the enj consolidation mean we will have crypto coin variety in this channel again??🙏🙏
1615934797,Thats not my fault is it?
1615934818,EVERYONE hop off of VET
1615934825,Get off of vets d
1615934825,I've wondered why the channels are not more coin specific btw.

1615934855,I can post a link if anyone wants it
1615934857,No and i will never have that data gathering scam :kekw:
1615934862,Had it for 2 years now
1615934864,u mean app that collect and sale ur data? 🙂
1615934874,Bc it is wise to have a variety in your portfolio. It is fucked up to swap between every chat
1615934885,True
1615934890,Pi wallet testing has begun
1615934892,With still no value or actually exchange system. And closed source so we dont know wtf it does
1615934913,"Why though? VET had news today that should have caused a huge spike, and it only went up by a bit and is already coming back down. Yesterday's news will not cause a rise tomorrow."
1615934915,Just press a magic button every day and free money.
1615934940,"Well they're free so will see what happens, they won't get much as all my good shit is in my knox"
1615934944,No wat really @RichySnipes
1615934946,Its not about VET news
1615934946,Ignore the people reporting app data usage sometimes being huge with no idea wtf it did
1615934954,Vet is a great project

1615934999,Didnt they claim a partnership with mcdonalds years ago that was denied hilariously?
1615935002,@draco if they make $1 that's fine for free
1615935022,Umm 5 months ago lol
1615935027,People dont understand the value of data it seems
1615935046,Been on it for 2 years and u already caught up 💀
1615935052,"No, they got nothing to hide. Yet they won't give me their email password."
1615935057,Haha
1615935077,Yeah I been doing the security circles and I have 6 people on my mining team
1615935081,I hope enj liquidates some fools
1615935087,I got everything to hide. Like my wife's smut videos made when we lived 6k miles apart
1615935092,@Cryptoknight can you now please hype everyone up for OCEAN?
1615935092,Ahhh I got 1 🤣

1615935224,Here comes the claims every single crypto now is ACTUALLY on the enj chain
1615935225,@bcdcdaz @Cryptoknight  i challenge you
1615935240,Dont. you will lose
1615935244,To what
1615935254,Reading the whole whitepaper and all relevant articles on ocean
1615935255,Enj is just a modified eth clone :kekw:
1615935259,So I'm guessing ENJ is just gonna chill now for a while so it consolidates
1615935266,Enj bubble
1615935272,60 mins or so
1615935274,OCEAN has a complicated pairing damn
1615935281,how can you read that chart lol

1615935300,

1615935335,Notice how dazz is not responding. He is currently buffering. Please stand by for amazing conclusion
1615935343,If we look at ENJ 4h chart we are very close to breakout
1615935349,So do you swallow or spit
1615935362,or he's reading the ocean whitepaper
1615935363,Depends. Did i eat it or drink it?
1615935368,Because god damn you got dazz deep down that throat
1615935371,Lol. Thats what i meant
1615935390,Nah. I idolize the guy afa crypto is concerned
1615935398,

1615935444,Remember. 4 dollars today. Or was that yesterday. And dont forget 10 dollard end this week
1615935463,Pretty sure somebody screencapped that

1615935473,You run after the money. i'll run after the future

1615935501,Im in VET to on Crypto.com
1615935504,Ffs its a dumb crypto being used as value in games like dlc. Chill.
1615935527,Only thing that matters is making money
1615935531,For fucks sake. I run a mid sized business dedicated to shit like that. Lol.
1615935546,"If it's not happening, then it's BTC's fault and we just go back in time a few days but the original plan is still on"
1615935551,Didnt you paper hands like 6 % a month ago
1615935554,"Maybe, but with that attitude, i've rarely seen people make any"
1615935565,Well at least it has some sort of practical application. The same cant be said by dozens of other shitcoins
1615935565,Yes. That should say a lot about ENJ

1615935716,Porn is allowed (loss porn)
1615935724,at like 0.8
1615935726,Yesterday it went to -600% and i diamond handed it :kekw:

1615935809,LongGore
1615935814,The problem with you guys was that NO ONE listened to us and everyone fought us when the time was right. Then you jump on board when you get FOMO. Probably also why this fell like this.
1615935824,thats not accurate lol
1615935840,most off us just bailed out at a certain point :p
1615935841,@SeineJanie Can we post this somewhere?
1615935874,Pin that for life
1615935881,"Just save it. Put it into your ""future rekked"" folder"
1615935889,"If it does, you have to send us a public video on this group where you are seen cutting your hair and eating it."
1615935894,
1615935896,Just a few
1615935900,No
1615935908,"That makes zero sense. But yeah, to be honest, I was suspicious at first because of the extensive shilling. Usually a good asset doesn't need **that** much convincing."
1615935924,But you're new to the game so I'll cut you both some slack
1615935925,Tbh swiss was earlier
1615935931,Iirc
1615935944,"Swiss, Crypto .. both called ENJ for good profit"
1615935950,"Thing is, i see why you think that, but no one said BUY ENJ. Only info was given"
1615935969,Really want to get into this again? Lol
1615935975,"CryptoDomme said, get in at 0.69 USDT"
1615935980,so adding margin is allowing you to go under 100% loss?
1615935986,Is it shilling when you know you have a good project that will make all long hodl investors rich??
1615935986,Oh ffs!! Can this be any clearer?? https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807387265152057374/816084612550754325
1615936005,can you please invest energy in finding other things then ENJ
1615936005,"you're missing **the word** ""BUY"" in a call? @Cryptoknight"
1615936009,that would be great
1615936016,Buy ormeus
1615936021,:kekw:
1615936025,God. I know this. I've seen it. Im talking more about the shit load of presentation material to help make that decision easier and to position ENJ to where it really is.
1615936026,This is the post that got me into ENJ. Daz and Crypto made me stay there.
1615936030,Trying to spread the wealth and make the world a better place
1615936039,"Well, that term is used somewhat loosely and not necessarily always in a negative sense"
1615936078,The worst mistake I ever made was just buying some ENJ with spare change I had in my spot account when she made that call. I didn't start doing futures yet. 😦
1615936082,Shilling is real. Its just that we were right and most other 'shillers' are not.
1615936089,Difference is the research
1615936106,"And not that ""i invested here, it fell, now help me raise the price'"
1615936127,"Then ENJ peaked at 0,91 and I waited for it to get higher and fomoed out at 0,86 making some more spare change in profit"
1615936136,agreed
1615936142,Yeah. I got in at 0.83 as well
1615936148,Dazz got in at 0.4
1615936158,
1615936162,"#🎓post-grads-podium is literally a god sent, wish I was here earlier to reap the potential"
1615936166,so I got into ENJ before you! 😮
1615936176,My 1st purchase of enj
1615936178,With 100%?
1615936179,Got in at 1.6 but sold some at like... 2.3
1615936187,Nice man
1615936192,"no, with spare change from my spot account"
1615936200,that taught me to take post grad calls more seriously
1615936227,
1615936246,"Soon people will say ""Wow, you got in under $10?"""
1615936249,look at the price for that day in usd
1615936250,Is enj over?
1615936251,**you** got word about ENJ from podium??
1615936271,No I learned of enjin myself
1615936295,and preached it to a few ppl who laughed at me
1615936386,
1615936409,I called 5 or 6 coins to xelo when I 1st joined
1615936422,ah kay ... that's what I remembered as well
1615936435,"I only ask cos half the I wna buy something it seems to die on its ass, in either cursed or need to work on my research"

1615936486,look at the prices
1615936517,
1615936525,I do have skills
1615936532,i actually got my first batch 0.40 something and sold it 0.90 something. thank u!
1615936554,Understatement
1615936589,But I was learning back then and new to the game so made predictions and watched for weeks with no stake
1615936702,Xvs

1615936751,"my  second attemp is red atm but I am sure it will recover.  I am new to this all, but I see one thing..  if you not patient.. u dont get far. s some guys said here buy it and forget it for a bit. ..  all those 5-10% here and there buy and re buy panic sale or panic hype buy.. eat a way more profit in the end 🙂 SO i got CHSB,  ADA and will leave it.  SYL was good buy i amd not  going check everyday and freak out  ""what did I do"".. hopefully wll get some casper too.. 🙂 and then will just wait. maybe i m too old lol or too inpatient.  but this  panica drops candles  dont give me ""sure feeling"" 🙂"

1615936890,grind those invites! 🙂
1615936890,trading starts on coinbase at 4pm. That should cause a huge spike
1615936913,6pm UTC whats thatUk time?:)
1615936918,I thought it was 5PM @Drahnreb
1615936922,for UK time
1615936930,yes
1615936960,9am pacific time. Isn't that 4pm utc?
1615936968,Is enj on coinbase yet
1615936968,Oh shit yeah you’re right
1615936980,asking the real question

1615937031,only because the US is already on daylight savings time
1615937057,bunch of weirdos
1615937084,come March 28 it will be 8 hrs between PT and UK time again
1615937084,"I'm going to wait a few hours (from now) to see if ADA cools down a bit, and then open a long which I intend to cash in on Thursday"
1615937100,Yeah waiting an hour before is actually pretty stupid
1615937186,Another These run on versally or versaty enjin or something (enjin) o'reilly run networks for 66% of fortune 100 companies
1615937197,Now do I do 25x leverage
1615937198,Hey so I'm getting an s19 by AntMiner and was wondering what I need to mount it or if I just need to keep it off the floor with a laptop stand
1615937216,you can just leave em on the floor
1615937221,mine were all on the floor
1615937246,Ok I mean I'll be getting another 2 after I make my money back from what I payed
1615937295,This shits dirt cheap
1615937320,"Now this, I call bullshit on. They may have something called ""enJin"" but that's totally different from $ENJ"
1615937323,
1615937347,"Maybe this is a dumb question, but why would you get out of ADA when it lists on CB?"
1615937348,Ur anus is always dirt cheap ^^
1615937410,Because it will peak and then retract (for a while)
1615937415,"And what's this claim about ""o'reilly run networks for 66% of fortune 100 companies""? O'Reilly is a book publisher afaik. Why do they run networks? And for so many Fortune 100 companies? Why does nobody else seem to know this?"
1615937427,"If you want to have ADA, you can buy it back at the retraction"
1615937459,good plan! 🙂
1615937475,what u think pick woild be.. sort of.. good sale ordr price?:)
1615937506,and then buy order:)
1615937506,@SeineJanie
1615937513,Has anyone made a price prediction/ general guess for ADA’s coinbase listing? I haven’t been reading the chats a lot this evening :c
1615937558,Is nicehash a go platform to mine bitcoin on
1615937560,I'll open a long tomorrow at what I hope to be the lowest rate for that day and then leave it open until whatever appears to be a peak on Thursday evening
1615937573,"not very scientific, but as a method probably good enough for large events like that 😄"

1615937747,
1615937759,Versant enJin != enjin.io
1615937764,nice ENJ dump lmao
1615937768,staying at 2.50
1615937774,it's a discontinued product to boost IBM WebSphere applications' performance
1615937777,enjin funded the network through the ibm partnership
1615937797,yes it is way bigger now
1615937809,you are gonna be printing for like a half year to pay one back
1615937824,"@bcdcdaz Versant was acquired in 2012 by Actian
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versant_Object_Database#History"
1615937849,enjin is still down 6 hours after
1615937861,and japan is awake even
1615937883,I still don't get the connection between Versant enJin and the Enjin Network
1615937891,just because they share the same letters
1615937920,And why would a gaming company run Java Enterprise applications?
1615937969,That's part of the enjin blockchain as a programming language
1615937976,This is not research! You're connecting unrelated dots
1615937984,ok guys. I am off to bed:)  dont fight to much. ENJ will be fine either way:) and if not. SYL bed and Casper will cover it all 😋
1615937989,How can a blockchain be a programming language??
1615938021,Lol you went too far dazz
1615938058,Next thing i know ENJ will be in my water supply

1615938133,
1615938223,Even if this isn't connected they don't need it anyway as have the bmw and property deal anyway
1615938228,"So you're telling me, because some company made a tool in Java for IBM WebSphere that boosts performance and was called ""enJin"" (notice the capitalization) and because Java is used as **one of the** programming languages in blockchain **development** (i.e. blockchains are realized by Java code, not blockchains run / execute Java code), that Enjin is powering all the Java code in the world?"
1615938246,lmao
1615938251,Or at least the learning platform by O'Reilly?
1615938279,No enjin powers java apps made on it's network
1615938289,not all java apps
1615938327,"okay, that sounds reasonable"
1615938352,"But how is the connection to O'Reilly learning platform and 66% of Fortune 100 companies made?
Because O'Reilly published a book about Versant enJin in 2003?"
1615938354,I have researched everything
1615938365,When Enjin Network was still about gaming only?
1615938366,"Its called coorporate shilling
You dress up regular shilling with fancy reasoning"
1615938407,And I say your research is wrong.
1615938409,"While true, that is news from half a year ago and hardly a base for any recent or future spike :/"
1615938428,"No the IBM, windows, Xbox it's all starting to run on enjin"
1615938438,At least on this point. Because I know a thing or two about Java and enterprise applications. And they are not run by a gaming company.
1615938446,Bullcrap
1615938449,Enjin backed projects that is
1615938496,Alex Solomon is the big connection
1615938551,Time will tell anyway as to whether I was down a wrong hole
1615938552,"Microsoft is working together with Enjin on bringing NFTs to Minecraft. Which perfectly fits their vision of a **gaming company**. And you make this to mean that soon all Microsoft products and platforms will somehow (even if it makes zero sense from a technical pov) ""run on Enjin""?"
1615938572,"No, dude! Do legitimate research, not this snake oil stuff."
1615938594,ENJ to $10 does not mean you were right on Microsoft switching Windows **and** Xbox to Enjin!
1615938594,Microsoft Azure rewards white paper
1615938617,They have started to work with ps5 too
1615938622,"This will not mean Windows will be rewritten to run on a gaming platform, which Enjin essentially is"
1615938634,Bro Enjin to $50000 end of week I have my sources DYOR
1615938647,They have the first game using an enjin payment system launching soon
1615938667,Now that sounds more plausible
1615938675,"Enjin, gaming company, doing something with games"
1615938681,I'll believe that in a second
1615938711,Hey guys ive a question is it legal for a 17y old to trade crypto?
1615938725,"The six dragons on steam, Xbox and ps5"
1615938774,"yeah, I think you have to be of age"
1615938783,yo
1615938797,Most sights have to be like 18+ but there’s people here who arnt and trade somehow
1615938798,@bcdcdaz if u are so intelligent why still no $3 as u said 12 hours ago
1615938824,"No, you said ""No the IBM, windows, Xbox it's all starting to run on enjin"". That's a far cry from ""some game will come out on Xbox and PS5 and be tied to NFTs purchasable with ENJ"""
1615938838,Probably Bitcoin's fault
1615938852,That's what @Cryptoknight would say
1615938918,"I am open to constructive criticism, You know what rabbit holes and no sleep are like"
1615938939,"Jan almost made me FUD out of ENJ, but imbeciles like Kayne shitting on daz increase my confidence in the coin"
1615938966,Checked my ENJ long for the first time in hours and it very quickly flashed from some ridiculous red number to a green
1615938970,This is not about how you should day trade ENJ. This is about what's legitimate research and what's blown out of proportion
1615938974,I don’t know what I’ve missed but I’m glad I did
1615938978,We had $3 yesterday or did you miss that
1615939006,"I know, and I am very glad that you are bringing this whole thing back down to earth."
1615939012,$3.01 at huboi
1615939046,Thanks and it is appreciated
1615939074,"You know, I don't think you're that far off. But sometimes, whether because of excitement or wanting to believe really strongly, you blow things bigger than they are and that can be dangerous. I'm not saying Enjin doesn't have a great future ahead and it will probably reach $10 or more, but claiming that it runs all of IBM, Windows and Xbox and 66% of Fortune 100 companies use it somehow? That's just a) unbelievable and b) as we've seen, not true. And that puts people off."
1615939101,"You guys need to realize Kanye is a troll, and a pretty good one at that."
1615939123,"That's also why none of this was said on stream, if it's not 100% I won't say it"
1615939139,but you said it
1615939139,here
1615939141,for weeks
1615939158,minus your departure time obviously
1615939180,I am stick in ENJ for a while anyway so
1615939212,Are you green yet
1615939221,"It should start warming up the enjin now, next candle about to start"
1615939245,"I really hope that ENJ cracks the 4$ mark asap. A little bit because that would get me my losses from last night back, but mostly because that will finally put an end about these endless discussions *about* dazz, present or not, which this channel now mostly is about. 😫"
1615939260,I also tried to get help with research and validating stuff in here
1615939285,got told to stop shilling a shit coin about to dump
1615939285,"btc above 57k, bullrun continues"
1615939314,"Well, it did dump. Before going to the moon. 😄"
1615939325,Well... the numbers say it's down 10% from yesterday
1615939336,"It did a 5x last couple of weeks, sure"
1615939336,it hasn't dumped once
1615939342,I’m just tired of talking about ENJ to be honest. Either invest in it or don’t and move on ffs
1615939343,"But for ppl reading this **now**, it's risky"
1615939346,"whenever we disagreed with statements you would blow us off essentially and just keep going so yeah. we went ""lol shill""."
1615939360,from it's ath yeah but 2-3 day growth
1615939381,remember if ENJ goes 80 bucks I am going to get ENJ on my ass
1615939391,it's in the past now in my eyes anyway
1615939416,let's continue the path to riches
1615939430,Actually shilling is against the rules regardless of what coin it is ☝️
1615939447,looks like that call on matic was also correct
1615939449,it's coming back
1615939454,Will ADA retract before thursday or is it good time to get in now?
1615939458,"And on one hand you and CryptoKnight keep saying how ENJ is better than BTC, is independent of Bitcoin and will outperform and eventually replace Bitcoin, but the moment Bitcoin dips and takes the market with you, ENJ drops even harder, you say ""oh, it's Bitcoin's fault"". So is it now another alt, tied to Bitcoin or is it special and independent? Can't flip flop on that all the time."
1615939459,This.
1615939480,"Thanks, master."
1615939480,tbh
1615939483,ada is just as annoying
1615939490,YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH
1615939492,but w/e
1615939494,:dababy:
1615939504,ye fuck ADA
1615939505,😄
1615939514,"Charles is literally god, you have no clue what you’re talking about."
1615939515,I'm only a month in the game though and learning every day
1615939516,ADA had more than just 2 people betting on it though but honestly fuck ada. It liquidated me today shorting it
1615939517,i will sip cocktails when ada goes 100 bucks
1615939537,Ill jump on the fuck ada train all day long after today
1615939537,like here's matic coming back strong after a long downtrend but nobody's talking about. amazing opportunity for some profits
1615939544,why are we talking about an already pumped ada?!
1615939545,wtf.
1615939553,That’s how it goes man.
1615939562,wait till 1.10 or so man
1615939563,i guess
1615939564,People don’t talk about the big pumps until after they happen
1615939566,:chad: you tried bro good job
1615939576,Was anyone talking about ALICE before +30000%?
1615939576,Because it was resident sleeper for weeks and pumped huge
1615939580,"or short it to 1.10 👀  not really sure how it could move, but could be an expected retracement"
1615939582,And a lot of people own it
1615939584,Learning is good. That’s why we’re all here. But remember to truly learn before you start teaching
1615939597,ada is green BNB is green.
1615939621,ENJ come on
1615939621,I wouldn’t short ADA yet. Doesn’t it go live on CB tomorrow or something
1615939624,a 25% pump is pretty crazy to happen in a matter of a few minutes when the coin has been dead for weeks now
1615939626,18th
1615939626,😭💀💀
1615939636,"Thanks, man! Preciate it"
1615939642,Thursday
1615939643,❤️
1615939643,You're talking about it 😉
1615939649,I learn from the Post Grads everyday and I could not comfortably make any calls even though I’ve been in crypto since like 2013
1615939658,@bcdcdaz
1615939681,but unfortunately that announcement came AFTER I started shorting it and caused my liquidation
1615939687,Oooof
1615939690,Sorry Jeremy
1615939699,That's a fake gain. Almost nobody got any reasonable volume at 0.10 which this is based on
1615939700,"i'd expect a lil move down before the release there, and then a few hours going up up up up and then back down before the day ends, maybe even to the current price"
1615939701,Its nbd. Dont invest money you arent willing to lose
1615939703,Im into crypto 3 weeks and it is amazing how much i've learned already by only being in this group!
1615939728,Why is matic starting to rise the minute you said this?
1615939731,Yeah that’s a good point.
1615939732,Sometimes we have loss days. That happens; That is why its very important you dont put money in the ring that is important to you
1615939733,yeah but poor boy that sold at 0.10
1615939757,"If you NEED that money, it shouldnt ever touch an exchange"
1615939765,Right
1615939769,replace stairs with ADA
1615939781,His group pumped it 😉
1615939782,This is gambling money for me.
1615939806,I warned about it couple of hours ago https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/821502076227420160
1615939815,you did
1615939831,Thats where I am at as well.
1615939849,I'm hoping for ENJ to hit 4$. That's not a warning or a prediction.
1615939852,also this was fascinating lol https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/821502413609107508
1615939853,:kekw: i got too much money pumped in ENJ to keep it from liquidating
1615939858,It gets lost in the noise. Need to post with same frequency as *other coins* are mentioned 😉
1615939869,yeah lol
1615939872,"If your liq price is 0, you never lose"
1615939874,How do you match ENJs posting frequency
1615939879,https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-meme-gif-7715402
1615939906,so what you are saying is sell my 9 BNB put it all into margin so I NEVER get liquidated
1615939915,ye
1615939916,Exactly!!!!
1615939931,also cant get liquidated if got no money
1615939946,"also PSA if your liq price is 0 and you are doing isolated, you should be doing spot as you are at 1x leverage 😂"

1615940087,It's still a move in the right direction tho
1615940107,damn btc really is a pnd coin
1615940110,maybe if they didn't censor porn japanese guys wouldn't think vajayays are pixels. :kekw:
1615940116,We should see a big rise once that BMW-system goes worldwide
1615940130,"putting ""digital currency"" and ""central bank"" in the same sentence... does not end up good"

1615940155,it is
1615940174,how the hell does my purchasing power decrease when i increase leverage on a future
1615940180,"ppl heard ""yoo wait for second wave, hodl hodl"" and took it serious"
1615940180,margin
1615940184,they still waiting the 2nd wave
1615940193,50x can purchase ~2k
1615940203,20x can purchase ~3.3k
1615940223,margin overhead I think
1615940259,"so if i had greater capital, i can take advantage of the increased leverage?"
1615940322,
1615940357,Man so enj becames an stagnant coin at 2.50
1615940358,wow
1615940370,2.50 for over 12 hours by now
1615940399,give it time man
1615940411,it can't pump every quarter of a day lol
1615940414,when's the dumb game coming out?
1615940423,19th
1615940431,ok cheers
1615940469,It used to pump with 2 day pauses
1615940483,So I think we're more than fine
1615940503,indeed man
1615940541,
1615940560,They should all be getting up now
1615940564,japan isn't going to save ENJ
1615940570,not for now
1615940571,anyway
1615940575,Exchange opened 20 mins ago
1615940604,We should see it going up again tomorrow
1615940608,"She doesn't need saving, just a gentle push"
1615940931,Support is building and the walls are moving back
1615941051,"😄 The *second* I go in on another ENJ future, it pumps 😄"
1615941117,"I hear ‘buy walls’ and ‘sell walls’ often but don’t actually understand what they mean. From just assuming, if the sell walls are pushed back, does that indicate a possible movement in the coin or am I being really silly"
1615941118,50% = $50
1615941124,Nice jan:p
1615941125,damn he was on point again
1615941128,enj moving

1615941456,I can see the exact walls on binance or binance futures
1615941466,"Well... not easy, but quick"
1615941490,"yeah, you just gotta switch direction at the start 😉"
1615941492,I can update in  here

1615941624,"matic was .34 earlier today, it's having an amazing recovery. obviously it's gonna have some pullback throughout, but it will grow"
1615941634,I was just gonna stream my walls monitor for you but can't share my screen
1615941642,you don't expect it go just go straight up right?

1615942010,sorry but no. I don't trust this coin to stay up. I nearly got killed by 2.34

1615942259,Rough day 😢

1615942281,@Cryptoknight BTC whenever ENJ pumps :dababy:
1615942286,those sms are so annoying
1615942289,nope. its a security measure
1615942297,Lol. Why?
1615942309,@bcdcdaz seeing the sell walls at 2.9 and 3.0? oof. do you think it's possible to break it? do you recall if sell walls were this big last time it went to 3.08?
1615942311,because the BTC whales pump to keep your man down
1615942311,if btc is up enj is up
1615942331,if my dick is up my wife is down. :kekw:
1615942339,"Im putting a sell wall at 2.9, nothing will come though"

1615942442,everytime we get close to an ath Enjin drop a tweet
1615942541,I feel like we are still in teh middle of the pump. Just taking a break to avoid suspicion
1615942578,good night fellas... only got 4 hrs till I need to be up again 😬
1615942582,nah is going down
1615942590,i have a long but cammon
1615942592,night!
1615942594,lets look at the facts here
1615942597,night!
1615942606,this was obviously a pre pump
1615942622,from nowhere on site it went in 1 min 8% up
1615942623,Night jan:)
1615942626,Not sus at all
1615942685,!warn @Kayne don't set ground to start ENJ beef again
1615942686,
1615942697,?
1615942704,:binance:
1615942708,im literally saying how it is? Why would i want to start beef lol
1615942721,it went from being stagnant to a %8 pump out of nowhere
1615942726,and now is coming back to where it was
1615942752,volume is too high to just be some pump IMHO
1615942758,i mean prepum
1615942760,then how do u explain it
1615942769,suddenly 8k people decided to buy at the same time
1615942772,and then dump
1615942790,how does bitcoin go from 59K to 50K in like 10 minutes
1615942796,"Maybe it’s the Japanese waking up, someone was explaining earlier that when they log into the games that use it it increases the price somehow"
1615942797,bc BTC is well known
1615942808,not like enj that is only known by certain people and japan
1615942810,I did explain this
1615942812,This is normal
1615942815,no because its a shitcoin owned by banks and governments and its just a playtoy of the ultra rich
1615942847,"that is what the ""decentralized"" crypto has become. just another tool of wallstreet for manipulation."
1615942866,who cares
1615942869,you’re being a negative Nellie 😢
1615942870,if u can make money of it
1615942888,barely with BTC TBH
1615942914,if you know then you know
1615942915,me to myself
1615942917,
1615943044,volume has hardly budged
1615943098,i just noticed supply is 83% i thought the whole supply was already out
1615943154,"It is, it can only decrease"
1615943161,not if one of the devs hold in his private wallet 3 million ENJ
1615943162,lmao
1615943174,and that is only one of the devs
1615943175,they released all of them at the same time
1615943188,multiple the number of devs by 3 million and thats where ur enj is left
1615943197,literally the dev posted his wallet on telegram
1615943224,numbers don't lie. literally says 83% of total supply is currently out. where is the rest
1615943230,
1615943259,burned or invested into projects
1615943279,SFP MOON BITCH
1615943284,Fuck enj
1615943307,Or maybe they are the prizes for all the competitions they do

1615943604,Arguably good news for a future prepared for Thursday :godsgardener:
1615943614,@Sausage Destroyer  what is your prediction for SFP?
1615943650,"I looked at the chart but I don't really understand how to read the graphs,"
1615943688,And you seem to be quite knowledgeable about spotting things like falling pennants etc
1615943761,What is the formation from March 14 - 16?
1615943777,It's like a huge parabola
1615943804,After a massive price spike
1615943903,Its already started to go parabolic I got on the ride yesterday
1615943918,
1615943950,I dont hand out calls like candy because people need to learn how to analyze it themselves so instead I give learning recommendations
1615943973,On how to learn to read the indicators and which work best for which scenario
1615944051,Go on pretty please
1615944106,"I would but I'm currently sitting in my best friends graduation ceremony, will drop some more knowledge nugs when I get home"
1615944127,Understood. Thanks 😊
1615944173,@Sausage Destroyer  thank you 😊

1615944900,STMX is rocking again
1615944908,Up 25% from yesterday
1615945263,"From CryptoBirb newsletter:
> It's true that Bitcoin had us used to a lot of volatility and suspense with its recent price action. Over the past few days, however, the market has gone relatively sideways. This has two derivatives.
> The first is that opportunities arise in alts as Bitcoin tranquillity creates the space needed for other cryptocurrencies to make important moves.
> These opportunities are fewer than before because there is no such thing as ""ride the trend"" at the moment. Yes, the primary trend is bullish but we are now in a secondary, shorter-term trend in which momentum has slowed."
1615945711,well im going to bed
1615945736,any idea when PHB staking for hzn will begin?
1615945738,@bcdcdaz please make sure ENJ doesn't crash down to like 2 bucks
1615945741,on binance or otherwise
1615945855,"I will try, fil popped 30% today"
1615945919,
1615946206,down we go
1615946334,Moon or Dump ?
1615946476,mars
1615946643,u guys think $OMI would be a good long term hold
1615946801,
1615946808,Based on fa analysis
1615946873,:kekw: hype man on youtube or whatever social.
1615946884,Eh added marging for wase of mund
1615946886,Mind
1615946898,2.02 should be stupidly safe right?
1615946911,No I'll link the video cos his ta ones were actually reasonable
1615946927,https://youtu.be/2RblDIbD0Nk
1615946994,So daz liq point of 2.02. How safe yah think
1615947040,My chart doesn't have it dropping below the start of this 6 hour candle
1615947062,The video at least backs up my fa analysis lol
1615947092,
1615947106,Your analysis had 10 dollars end this week remember
1615947111,:godsgardener:
1615947162,All i want man is it to be stable at 2.9 to 3 bucks. Just so i dont have to sit at -300% for a whole day and so i can relax my margin :kekw:
1615947190,Still time yet
1615947197,
1615947205,I say it's good
1615947448,I have faith in a return to 3 and above but man. These support testinf at 2.5 2.4 and yesterday 2.34 was terrifying. I dont care about enj as a project but i AM bullish for 3 to 4 maybe 5
1615947500,Hey @felguerr what coins can we use to pay on coinlist for casper soooon. Also how longer until chsb community premium?
1615948079,@bcdcdaz i see your downward force and i refuse liquidatio . No way in hell that 1.89 is happens unless super scandal
1615948084,Good night
1615948102,nah you look good
1615948116,sleep tight
1615952016,cardano ? any sight ?
1615954324,Man if enj gets at 2.9 while i sleep i swear
1615954343,I want to be awake
1615954547,"idk, the dumping has begun already"
1615954551,for the 5th time
1615954574,btc isn't being given a break
1615955118,Goddamn ENJ I hope it won't reach 2.45 :|
1615956934,1 cent away
1615956965,there's a high change of it reaching 2.45 so be careful
1615956975,and sell if it's too much of a risk of liquidation
1615957838,Woke up and sold mine
1615958441,lost 600 bux on ENJ futures
1615958444,😦
1615958455,oh well it's at a good price
1615958458,time to buy again!
1615958634,HBAR why you betray me like this? :’(
1615959118,Wow enj really shit the bed while I fell asleep
1615959144,"Good morning!
All my BTC indicators say, we're going down for a while, so I went short. Long term bullish trend still unbroken though, no need to panic if you're a long term hodler that deserves the name."
1615959743,"Oh CHSB, my trusty Swiss friend! 🥰"
1615960280,bro enj has only bring loses to people who long lmao
1615960362,.
1615960758,Let's hope for the rocket to be ready and re fuelled tofsg
1615960760,Today
1615961088,Is it possible the ADA news stuffed up ENJ’s rapid rise?
1615961123,Just seems interesting that it coincided even if they aren’t linked
1615961309,well i made 500 on it like an hour before lol
1615961318,it just went deep into support zone
1615961321,didnt think it would go there
1615961327,liq price is even lower this time
1615962596,I brought in at 2.43 on a 50x with another 100 dollars let's go again
1615962608,Go ADA go!
1615962893,Is enj consolidating
1615963301,"I mean, would you look at that?!"
1615963323,Yeah looking at it from a daily point of view you would be ecstatic
1615963324,"Can't always be pushing the upper BB higher, has to correct every once in a while to stay healthy."
1615963513,Going through 1.29 fairly significant for ADA. If it pushes through 1.30 will be awesome. Hard to believe it’s been nearly 3 weeks since ATH
1615963907,
1615963911,M is for moon right
1615964018,What about xlm
1615964020,never grown
1615964184,lads there is gonna be a fat ada pump
1615964444,oof ada goin offf
1615964481,Just got a buy signal for BTC on the 15m. Looks like it's going up again! ☺️
1615964643,Can anyone tell me if I'm being a dumbass holding onto a wee bit of rsr? 🤔
1615964681,
1615964907,you short it?
1615964947,"no, it jumped ~6 hours ago when i longed"
1615964967,damn lucky
1615964980,i entered a bit up from that so i just have to wait
1615965597,I see nothing got liquidated
1615966174,Morning folks
1615966203,So btc will have a little rise you think @SeineJanie
1615967121,So you all are probable going to laugh at my dumb question. But I need to know so it’s fine
1615967197,I am transferring from Free Wallet to Trust Wallet. Trust wallet is asking if my USDT is a TR20 or ER 20 coin.  Where would I find this info?
1615967332,"When withdrawing, you should be able to see which network the transaction will be on"
1615967389,That’s what I thought. But it’s asking for my selection before anything else
1615968519,Grandad coin still taking his fall down the stairs
1615968602,Today and tomorrow is all about ADA .
1615968723,"Yes, as long as we still stay above that line it should go up"
1615968914,Thanks bro!
1615968935,stonks
1615969026,Gah! On the 1h chart there's a sell signal though ...
1615969043,maybe wait a bit more with trading and keep your position or stay out if you're out
1615969230,Fuck yes baby
1615969242,All u hoes that bought enj last nightt at 2.5$
1615969246,I told y’all
1615969267,Fill the bag at 2.37$ or so
1615969280,Patience is key
1615969281,Damn bye ENJ
1615969296,😦
1615969298,Fill ur bags
1615969307,2.17 Liquidation
1615969311,I still have margin :p
1615969326,2.17 seems quite safe
1615969331,I wonder if Belgian liquidated yet I can’t remember his
1615969343,its really low I think
1615969348,1.8 or something
1615969357,Swiss added to his margin
1615969366,ENJ fell so ADA could fly x
1615969370,1.89 for Belgian
1615969371,"So swiss is safe, swiss liq spot is 2.30 on the dot"
1615969384,Ada to the ⚰️
1615969405,where is that SLP shiller dude
1615969409,its in a dip
1615969409,The charts don’t lie boo
1615969412,I need a chart on it
1615969437,"If you guys really want to make cash, STMX been making moves recently"
1615969446,Good buy and hold
1615969467,hold? I thought we are only doing high risk leverage here
1615969490,This 🤣🤣
1615969497,Apologies I will slink away now...
1615969528,Weeeeeeee ADa up! I have 1k + of it 🙂 it’s finally back to green 🙂 a like my 200 ENJ   Need to wait for ENj get back to green 🙂
1615969538,50x lose half ur portfolio type risk
1615969541,🤣
1615969550,When do you see a buy opportunity for Storm it has been going crazy last days
1615969579,ADA will be over $2 tmrw. Ez money. Doesn't take financial advisor to tell you this
1615969585,"Honestly believe it’s come down enough to buy. Even if it comes down to 2.5, buying at 3 isn’t terrible considering how cheap it is"
1615969594,it will be dumped after the news
1615969597,like always :p
1615969600,ADA being listed on coinbase tomorrow?
1615969602,OK 1.97 liq price SHOULD be safe..........
1615969605,So whens thisbADA news is It tomorrow or today
1615969607,When is it actually getting listed on Coinbase
1615969608,or atleast a slow dump
1615969614,Thursday
1615969619,I learned from the fork news 😂
1615969620,Tomoz
1615969625,Sweet
1615969631,Thanks bb
1615969649,"ADA literally been waiting on news the past 3 weeks lol. If more and more people are staking, then you could be very very wrong about a slow dump"
1615969665,9am Pacific tmrw
1615969674,So sell tonight or thursday ?
1615969701,oof oof that enj not looking good lol
1615969705,liq price still miles away
1615969708,Atleast hold for few hours after listing tmrw
1615969709,now we shoot up lessgooo
1615969797,"new to this, will ADA rise today as more people jump on before coinbase listing? So best buy now?"
1615969801,It shows 94% de centralized now...  it was 80+ 3 weeks a go.
1615969816,Coinbase had three new listings last week they all shot up on news and on the actual listing.  ADA doesn't have to compete with two new coins and ADA is #3 crypto in world without ever being listed on coinbase which is impressive
1615969853,Enj trend has reversed hasn't it?
1615969855,"Now is the best time, don’t think we’ll see it too much lower than current price at least for a few days"
1615969865,It might just go up n never come back down
1615969871,That is my hope
1615969873,Not worth waiting for dip on ada
1615969899,"hmmm, maybe not. stayed strong at support, possibly going up now"
1615969907,"but then again, btc is once again leading the charge"
1615969916,"if btc continues pooping bricks, enj will too lol"
1615969920,Smart contracts to be delivered on April 1 so holding for two weeks could see a huge hike in price
1615969951,I hope for all the people who were so brave holding ADA 🙂
1615969966,I tried to think of what ADA ceiling is and only thing I can compare to is xrp three years ago when it got to like $4.  Only science behind this is amount of coins in circulation.
1615969973,Not brave when you believe in it
1615969993,"the most recent coin that got listed on coinbase pro was matic, it dumped hard, but hey.. doesn't mean ada will. their market caps are not comparable"
1615970001,😩  why is enj crashing agaaaain @bcdcdaz @Cryptoknight save me
1615970015,"but keep in mind, a shit ton of buys happened today when news hit, meaning that they bought the news, probably not the coin"
1615970020,so these same people might dump
1615970029,anyone who wanted to invest into ada and hold would have done it by now
1615970029,Guys 30x on ADA?!
1615970033,why wait for huge news?
1615970033,Or is that too crazy?!
1615970039,id buy adaup
1615970041,Or people who realised that their last chance to get it below 1.10 was then
1615970048,And it went nuts
1615970051,What is ada up
1615970059,I'm gonna try and sell at 2.2-2.5 I think. But we shall see how it goes tmrw
1615970068,maybe yeah but holy fuck these's been almost 2 weeks of 1.0
1615970082,speculation token. if ADA is expected to go up/goes up ADAUP wins value. opposite for ADAdown
1615970141,"Yeah, but there was no imminent news to make people want to buy. Hell, even I was getting nervous with the lack of new news despite knowing all the developments incoming"
1615970141,I still believe
1615970144,it needs to be weekend already so the big institutions don't trade and we can go back up
1615970159,I brought in at 2.37 lol
1615970161,TP for ADA tomorrow?
1615970168,I still believe @Cryptoknight
1615970179,we're all fucked if btc dumps right now
1615970185,"Charles was copping stick on Twitter and being a bit silly which made me antsy, but the coinbase news has settled those nerves"
1615970193,🤩  $2 ADA?
1615970200,and it's sadly not looking too great atm
1615970212,wait since when was my liquidation 1.89 on ENJ guess I did another half asleep move
1615970227,lower high on 1h chart and going down...
1615970233,damn.
1615970245,Don’t think we’ll see that straight away unless Africa news occurs
1615970259,SAFE
1615970285,Everything got fucked up when Kayne entered
1615970289,always
1615970299,"U love to see it, Enj?!"
1615970325,Yeah 100 dollars on a 50x fuck it @RichySnipes  new highs 🤣🤣🤣

1615970478,I took a 20 dollar hit and took the money out and brought back in now

1615970515,Fuck dude
1615970522,imma get fucked if this happens
1615970530,during the time ENJIneer said 2.40 would never happen again
1615970533,My original buy order was 2.36 but I fomod ans bought at 2.37
1615970535,but bad move
1615970536,should of waited
1615970557,he also said that it would for sure hit 3 dollar lol
1615970558,I am just trying to survive the bear market on ENJ
1615970567,same lol
1615970572,he only says that because dazz keeps on saying that
1615970581,but it will reach that
1615970582,eventually
1615970586,I hope enj stays green
1615970589,not today nor tomorrow. maybe not for a whole week
1615970634,just waiting for a next little peek
1615970639,and then I am out
1615970640,eh it will go up

1615970652,I thought I was done with ENJ but here we are
1615970659,my liquidation is not low enough for that
1615970662,"I'm 100 %enj. Even now. Every 0.1, I lose or gain $200. Money where my mouth is"
1615970693,"if enj maxes out at ~2.50 during the next ""bull run"", it is definitely bearish and going down to ~2.15-2.20 support"
1615970701,Lot of room in that mouth then
1615970750,peaks have been .20c lower every bull run since 3.08
1615970750,"Yeah I got enj at 2.44 last night, feel like I fomo'd a wee bit"
1615970760,"so the next bull run, if it stays at 2.50, gtfo"
1615970770,and don't go in until early $2's
1615970790,atleast we didn't reach a lower low in the last 3 days
1615970809,ah i see my favorite brit typing
1615970814,How does it work?
1615970819,LMAO howl if it wasn’t for the shilling I wouldn’t be like this 😔
1615970824,when ada goes up
1615970826,adaup goes up more
1615970834,when ada goes dowj
1615970840,adaup goes down more
1615970842,good point tho.
1615970853,:godsgardener:
1615970855,But whats the catch?!
1615970860,Whats the downside too it?
1615970867,thats the catch right there
1615970869,Ada futures is liquidation
1615970875,Whats ada up?
1615970879,Down side
1615970881,its a leveraged token
1615970903,but unlike a future you can't get liquidated
1615970936,Richie gonna be testing this out in less than an hour
1615970959,"But then if price drops, what happens?! U just lose more in value untill u make a stop loss?!"
1615970968,yes
1615970978,they're a lot more expensive @RichySnipes just had a look. Don't know if you can buy SATs tho for them
1615970995,Ahhh lemme check
1615970999,i think UP tokens are like X5 values?
1615971008,Aren’t the fees heavier with leveraged tokens
1615971012,ADAUP like 120 US atm
1615971013,Or something idk
1615971051,honestly if ada breaks back down and goes back to  1 -1.05 I will probably renew my future to a higher leverage and margin buy ADA. I trust in it
1615971073,If ADA goes that far down again then goddamn
1615971087,Ada’s a shitcoin
1615971092,your mom is a shit coin
1615971092,Wouldnt be surprised
1615971101,worth 1 satoshi
1615971102,will be buying another 2-3k worth if it does lol
1615971115,lmao well yeah this
1615971126,all da staking rewards
1615971173,I did 50x futures when it hit 1 the other day and came out with 500% profit so I’m all for ADA dropping again but I wouldn’t wanna see it for the sake of the coin
1615971209,"if new people are staking and owners are stacking even more, I can't really see it dipping that much"
1615971211,ENJ dead put it in the ground
1615971305,LMFAO 😂😂💀
1615971326,U ever heard of the show 13 reasons why?
1615971327,No. Please. Not till I brake even lol
1615971332,@That one belgian super cunt
1615971380,Bro ur just making bank off futures rn 👀
1615971407,lmao I only tell you about the good ones
1615971429,Not about the times I tried shorting ohhhh boy
1615971697,enj looking really bad again lol
1615971712,let's hope it doesn't break under 2
1615971735,pls..
1615971788,oh god
1615971802,2.35 testing
1615971829,I feel I should bail lol
1615971834,ikr lol
1615971836,buuut...
1615971837,If btc drops
1615971837,idk
1615971840,Enj is gone
1615971844,absolutely
1615971850,it's already at its lowest...
1615971859,"btc drop 1k, enj is below $2"
1615971868,Im abouta sell when it hits 2.40 and call it a day on enj
1615971876,"I mean, I only play with money I can afford to lose, but having most of that in both ENJ and HBAR is pretty lame rn 😅"
1615971906,I like to put less than 20$ if im gonna do a 25x and up
1615971910,So im good too
1615971918,2.34
1615971924,Yeah enj ship is ⛵️
1615971940,yeah enj is kinda... gone
1615971947,momentum deceased
1615971961,keep in mind
1615971967,btc is still going sideways and enj is dropping
1615971970,Ugh it's looking worse by the second
1615971970,Isn’t it a downside triangle trend on ENJ? 🤔 Just checked the 1hr view and seems that ENJ can go up in hours 😑
1615971979,now if btc actually dipped a bit. oh god
1615971998,i hope so
1615972001,2.29 should be the floor here
1615972008,"But yes, depends on BTC"
1615972020,don't worry dazz is going to post walls with a number in the middle and it will pump
1615972022,ironically
1615972038,2.32 is the ultimate support level imo
1615972048,"if it breaks that, it will tank harder than you can follow it"
1615972063,check march 15th
1615972068,that's the support there
1615972069,"What you mean by ""support level""? Still learning terminologies and what not"
1615972069,2.32
1615972078,nahnah $7 by end of the week
1615972084,Bitcoin really needs to pump right now lol
1615972091,It passed 2.35 which aint good
1615972109,"yup, that was 2/3 support broken"
1615972115,last one being 2.32
1615972131,I think even if enj goes back up
1615972134,if you put it on the 5sec chart its mooning boys
1615972138,Its gonna be bearish for a while
1615972139,"if it doesnt tank below 2 now, it will probably be good"
1615972140,Yo Ricky new buy in 2.3400 xD
1615972141,Idk tho
1615972149,don't buy more of this trash
1615972149,game coming out in 2 days
1615972152,hahahahha
1615972164,doubt its gonna do anything
1615972171,Buy the news
1615972184,well
1615972195,are its fundamentals also trash?
1615972196,TBH we need to survive the week
1615972199,it really needs to hold 2.35 right now
1615972203,the moment I sell it will go to 3.5
1615972209,i thought there was a lot of excitement for it aside from price
1615972212,weekends tend to increase more
1615972214,relatable
1615972223,sell
1615972231,lmfao
1615972240,lmao enj is fucked
1615972251,"-46%, hmmmm"
1615972253,you just want it to fail because you don't like the chatter about it
1615972258,First it was ada shill
1615972261,Ada died
1615972261,not sure if the right time 😂
1615972265,Then enj shill
1615972268,Enj died
1615972277,omg
1615972277,U guys should just join the vet gang
1615972281,going down still

1615972297,i meant patawic
1615972302,ah
1615972318,btc is still sideways!
1615972323,this is enj dropping on its own!
1615972327,without btc looool
1615972327,well it failing isn't going do much since dazz and enjineer were early enough to profit
1615972331,It should bounce off 2.29 as per the trend line. Unless it does what Jan is saying and ends up consolidating now
1615972337,>want it to fail
1615972338,"Im so dissappointed in myself, this is gonna be, buy high sell low 💀"
1615972341,pls i have 1800enj
1615972350,oh ok
1615972360,lmao
1615972362,"Regardless of what happens, it will not fail. This will never fail"
1615972376,heading into 2.32
1615972376,gonna do the same shit as ada
1615972379,"imagine that ""enj only went down because BTC is evil and crashed us"" was bullshit and its still crashing with a sideways btc"
1615972379,you are jinxing it hard right now
1615972380,and do nothing for 2wks
1615972383,I had the same feeling when it hit 1.1
1615972386,the cosmos will punish us for your arrogance
1615972387,I also thought we were done for
1615972393,Lol. Maybe.
1615972399,Wait and watch it is!
1615972408,I cant watch it when I am liquidated
1615972410,:p
1615972418,Whats ur liquidation
1615972422,2.16
1615972433,I will bring it below 2 if I have to
1615972433,2.16 is fine
1615972437,Lol
1615972439,Should be fine
1615972449,inb4 my 1.89 isn't enough. :kekw: kill me
1615972451,it was obviously not this due to how severely it reacted to minor BTC dips
1615972456,Ur just gonna have a lifetime of red days tho
1615972459,i remember watching it and being concerned yesterday
1615972466,2.30 is my liquidation
1615972473,This is how i figure
1615972477,My ring piece is 50x tighter
1615972478,2.27 mine
1615972480,You might be in trouble
1615972484,Just like my leverage
1615972501,im at 1.97
1615972504,"yeah the whole ""ENJ IS STRONG AND ITS OWN THING AND DOESNT CARE ABOUT BTC"" was a pure none fact. like most of the billion connections made"
1615972506,did it touch the line yet?
1615972514,
1615972521,holy damn
1615972524,right at 2.3
1615972537,Wowwww
1615972546,"if btc drops, that line gonna break"
1615972548,I think its 2.29. Might have put the line too high
1615972562,My margin is 2.30081
1615972563,Unless it takes a while getting there
1615972566,Holy fuck
1615972571,OMG LOL
1615972575,😳
1615972583,Welp time to buy a bigger margin
1615972590,"In that case, this entire fall might have been to get you out. Lol"
1615972596,buckle up
1615972598,Not funny. Sry
1615972601,Hahaha
1615972604,"keep in mind... again... if btc falls, no line will help..."
1615972607,No it is
1615972607,Let’s goooooo stimulus monneyyyyy!!
1615972615,I'm dying inside xD
1615972624,Lol. To what? 45k? Unlikely
1615972634,just 1k drop and enj is dead
1615972634,Hits bank accounts at 8:30am EST
1615972640,BTC has another 14 days i think
1615972647,Btc will rocket
1615972649,If btc drops below 53k everyone in futures is fucked
1615972651,🚀
1615972653,Yes
1615972655,Unless ur below 10x
1615972658,THIS
1615972683,Why the hell are you in BTC futures anyway right now
1615972687,I pray to god enj is just consolidating  now lol
1615972691,ADA didn't really care about the drop did it?
1615972694,"No way that happens, influx of projected 30B coming in from stimulus checks"
1615972694,2.31!!!!!!!!!
1615972695,Im not 😂😂
1615972702,i'd say so
1615972706,2.31 👀👀
1615972708,I pray to god it isnt. Lol. Consolidation is worst case scenario
1615972710,2.30!!!!!!!!!!!!
1615972712,but you can never tell
1615972722,oh god
1615972724,testing 2.3

1615972746,hahahahaha
1615972747,idk why
1615972758,Ballin
1615972762,I guess because of... the moon.
1615972768,I took it out
1615972769,@DRAKO did you increase margin in time?
1615972772,You can always go to moms house
1615972772,ahhh
1615972778,WTF? Why
1615972784,wat
1615972787,Would have lost the same amount
1615972788,Didn’t care because so much of it was staked
1615972792,If you go broke
1615972796,Move in with mom
1615972804,Hope it goes lower
1615972805,"oooh. hahahah, naah I only invest what I can afford to lose, not a lot"
1615972809,So i can buy more
1615972810,Risk reward brah!
1615972815,it's just funny how it's going against every expectation
1615972815,It will pump again
1615972817,This is the last time it touched the line
1615972836,ye boye here that comes 🤣
1615972846,:kekw: imagine believing that
1615972851,Oh god

1615972916,its always down down down
1615972918,for 3 days now
1615972919,touched 2.28
1615972927,Surprised no one started selling when it dipped below 2.40
1615972931,3 days man. I've been looking at it for 2 weeks
1615972933,who are these people putting sell walls at 2
1615972935,why longing a coin in correction
1615972935,2.31
1615972946,yeah well 2 weeks was a massive over pump. over valued.
1615972970,"So worst case, it consolidates"
1615972977,i give it a day or day and half to rocket again
1615972978,If it hits 2.16 im liquidated 😭😭
1615972986,Exactly
1615973002,IN CASE it has to go up
1615973009,i dont trust this coin
1615973016,Time to stock up today
1615973017,The problem is that most of you went in with futures. Wouldnt have been a problem if this was all spot
1615973021,worst case is back to 1 dollar
1615973027,who was this dude that said correction was already done?
1615973028,Lol. No
1615973029,Buy buy buy

1615973052,Idk how I didnt anticipate the dip
1615973056,Yeah. Ok. Seems to like 2.29
1615973059,heh
1615973066,Imagine 25x at 2.28$
1615973071,"As I was trying to make a point of yesterday if they’d gone spot when Dazz was sharing everything they’d be golden right now and just waiting for the next surge, be that tomorrow or whenever"
1615973077,To 2.9$ 🤑
1615973095,imagine if i had made a 25x at 2.60-70 where i said this should have gone lower
1615973104,Lmao likes 2.29. That went fkn quick to 2.27
1615973117,NOOOOOOOO
1615973121,Exactly what iv been saying
1615973127,"knight you said 2.4 would never happen again TOO LATE ROCKET GIF MOON CHARTS. never gonna break 2.3. and so on and on. your predictions and dazz's are useless since ENJ is just a regular ass coin like every single out there with nothing special about its trading. it mooned because of hype and probably many people realised ""why the fuck do i care about DLC buying coins in japanese only games""

ENJ is just a normal coin"
1615973129,Enj to 2$
1615973133,Liquidation time
1615973147,Is swiss liquidated?!
1615973151,probably
1615973162,Imagine having a cross on it
1615973165,😭
1615973167,2.27
1615973169,jesus christ
1615973173,"dont spit too much truth, he'll block you too"
1615973186,it might actually settle around here
1615973190,idk
1615973191,"I didn't expect this, I assumed it as worst possible scenario, but it literally happened within an hour"
1615973193,not feeling as scared now
1615973198,This could easily drop below 1.90
1615973219,"now btc will dump, watch"
1615973223,:kekw:
1615973224,2$ is not far fetched
1615973230,Letsgoo
1615973236,Buncha panic sellin bitches
1615973239,yeah it's bouncing
1615973247,FYI ALL we are around a fibonacci retracement zone
1615973249,Buy the DIP
1615973252,around 2.29
1615973253,BUY THE DIP
1615973263,dont sell
1615973264,so if you made your homework if you were shorting would sell here
1615973275,"Want to pick your brain, when you go long with leverage what can you max out at?"
1615973276,"if you hodl, well... hehe"
1615973285,Imagine a 50x from here
1615973288,👀
1615973288,"That’s his own TA (which was wrong) but it’s your decision to follow it, people shouldn’t get in at the peaks they need to check the coin, do their own research once people mention it, you’re a supercunt you should know that.   Plus if you’d done the research you’d see they have 20+ games played worldwide not just Japan"
1615973294,might be a fakeout
1615973308,wait a bit more before buying in guys
1615973309,depends on leverage and margin
1615973309,srsly..
1615973321,my original liq point was 2.49
1615973322,Buy at 2.28
1615973329,I pumped money into it and now im at 1.89
1615973334,if I get liquidated I lose
1615973336,quite abit of money
1615973338,don't
1615973341,Damn
1615973343,The truth shall set you free my friend🙏
1615973348,wait for uptrend confirmation
1615973353,Yeah imma stay away from enj for weeks
1615973355,only trust in pink names. :kekw:
1615973371,Trust in VET
1615973373,if i were any of you i wouldnt make any move in this coin (in case you are not in)
1615973375,2 greens and a red is not a bounce
1615973379,2.27 👀
1615973383,"And if you don’t pump money into it, what happens"
1615973392,Especially if the red is bigger than the 2 green
1615973397,"Well, these kinda hypes happen a lot. Enj was a really great one, now on to the next"
1615973404,you lose all the money you put in a isolated leverage.

1615974250,And if it goes down
1615974258,Everything will follow

1615976139,"interestingly, in comparison, CHZ didn't touch a new local low today.. enj absolutely did, it broke through so many supports"
1615976176,"chz held really well at .48, previous low during the huge btc dump was .47"
1615976190,so what really made enj drop so much compared to other coins is what makes me wonder
1615976193,I blame kayne
1615976231,"being overbought and overextended can't be it, because chz is even worse in that department"
1615976232,idk
1615976237,but it's an interesting fact right there
1615976240,But seriously. I think FOMO is what caused this
1615976245,VET?!?!? 👀
1615976274,you mean FUD?
1615976383,😭😭
1615976620,yeah i got back in at ~2.28 😄
1615976663,I  got in at 2.25 lol
1615976678,I cant help it
1615976685,This is binance saying no
1615976708,"Damn, jinxed it by buying, sorry everyone"
1615976790,Just gna look at 1m charts now to make myself feel a bit better
1615976790,"yeah I noticed binance's desktop app was laggy as shit while everything was dropping, the traffic must have been insane"
1615976814,back to normal now
1615976815,Remember how bad binance was when elon bought bitcoin
1615976820,"I've noticed that a few times, think a server upgrade would help?"
1615976828,why u say jinxed?
1615976830,it looks fine to me
1615976871,"also, did you guys notice how so many altcoins started dropping before btc did? it was still moving sideways when everything started to take a dip..."
1615976886,"it only accelerated once btc dipped, sure, but it felt like altcoins knew it was gonna drop"
1615976891,how is that explained?
1615976905,Was looking at 15m and saw an immediate red stinker after I bought in lol seems alright now. Was just joshing
1615976918,There probably is some super group that communicates on stuff. Like billionaire whales
1615976928,that was my thought too
1615976934,>probably
1615976942,similarly to how ada was pre pumped just before coinbase announced the listing
1615976946,some people knew beforehand
1615976948,yeaaaah...
1615976959,"as much crypto is for ""everyone"", it's that much not"
1615976964,it was pumped at the same time im pretty sure
1615976972,there's definitely privilege in play
1615976973,Probably coinbase buying ADA to put on the wallet for selling
1615976983,"naaa, check the graph, check the timing of the announcement"
1615976986,like it pumped on the beggining of the hour exactly
1615976988,"it's no joke, it's so obvious"
1615976989,from what i saw
1615977026,maybe this tho..
1615977036,Got a idea on the volume of this spike?
1615977039,they did that way before
1615977056,they opened staking pools with millions of liquidity like weeks ago
1615977057,giga chad crypto exchange when
1615977088,I wonder how these guys survive. Imagine they buy in 50 million and then a month later it goed -70%
1615977105,And every coin they sell it at a loss
1615977110,having more than 50 million
1615977150,Lets start a exchange. Earn big bucks for 5 years and then exit scam with all the crypto and atomic swap it all :kekw:
1615977218,"Market manipulation at its best. The question is, when you sell ALT coins, the pair is generally with BTC. So where did all that money go if BTC dropped?"
1615977254,
1615977259,
1615977402,Dominus owns coinbase confirmed
1615977409,:kekw:
1615977436,Not a joke. He actually does. He owned coinbase before he started pumping.
1615977462,One day ada will be 5 dollars and i still will have my long open :kekw:
1615977470,In ENJ
1615977498,Unlikely
1615977531,"Bro. I know this has been a big fall, but im still hopeful that our targets were more or less accurate."
1615977555,I'll forget all of this happened if enj reaches $3 again in the next few days
1615977560,"Jan says consolidate, sure. It would then. But then back on track! Im sure @SeineJanie would agree"
1615977714,@SeineJanie What do you think abou tthis?
1615977821,
1615977937,This would be nicr
1615977954,:kekw:
1615977967,Haha. But it requires a lot of patience
1615977975,I dont have that
1615977980,Still not happening. :kekw:
1615977985,I can see 20
1615978006,How can 20 happen without 10 happening? Lol.
1615978027,Future wise
1615978049,Unless... you mean..... Another conspiracy? I KNEW i was on to something
1615978090,mfw you're still discussing this
1615978092,fuck me
1615978096,You entered at 2.49?? WTF?
1615978135,Oh fuck no
1615978141,2.59 :kekw:
1615978169,🤣
1615978188,Ok. Now we decide if we go up or down
1615978241,if I sold at 3 and rebought at like 2.3 😩  damn FOMO got me again
1615978269,Yes. Welcome to my life the last 2 weeks.
1615978282,Its really hard to judge the peak with ENJ
1615978284,it's crazy how much progress that btc makes in the upwards momentum over a day or two gets erased by sellers within just a few minutes
1615978288,i havent changed a single position in 2wks
1615978293,and im still up 40%
1615978305,Manipulated and coordinated bro
1615978331,Big ol btc pump be nice rn
1615978336,"feels like bulls work for bears, when bulls have finished their job and moved btc by 2k, bears come and take it from em"
1615978338,now do it again
1615978341,and again
1615978370,Crypto should be banned.
1615978380,it's slavery ikr
1615978417,"Absolutely. Crypto can destroy people. Insane. 

One sec. Gonna put a future on ENJ now"
1615978448,"nicely secured 2.37, chasing .38, looking good"
1615978456,currently....
1615978490,"So in this,, i realised only now, that the day candles are not MY day. Any idea how this works?"
1615978499,So what's the expectations now? I wouldn't mind making as much back as pos
1615978504,Opinion on lisk?
1615978515,Very very lisky
1615978515,I gotta stop dipping in and out of ENJ
1615978551,"after so much resistance, ath... but maybe still too soon."
1615978561,"looks like bitcoin may dip again, wait to enter ENJ again 🙂"
1615978561,I'd first check to see how it tests 2.50s
1615978567,"if it falls back, it's a really bad sign"
1615978589,Hes right
1615978601,I'm up 200% atm
1615978603,good point!
1615978603,And counting
1615978605,Ive had enj from 2.70 so  hope it rises again
1615978616,I full on degen that shit
1615978622,STMX gogogo
1615978651,May of lost 50 dollars but 100 in on a 50 x at 2.25 I cant complain
1615978671,You think its going to break the last ath?
1615978679,Or double top
1615978692,I think it’ll slowly build.
1615978749,"oof, btc looking on the edge here"
1615978762,"goddamn, the past few days have been torture with btc"
1615978767,Ill maybe set a sell order 0.037
1615978837,Set it for .42 I reckon
1615978846,Sorry 0.042
1615978871,Unless you have an urgent need for that money
1615978908,LTC has been dissapointing me lately
1615978939,
1615979329,Fuck! BTC dumping again!
1615979447,Shit
1615979452,Yes! BTC sale again!
1615979532,Btc dumping is good right now
1615979538,Look at alt marketcap
1615979543,Increasing as btc dumps
1615979570,doesnt look like a dump to me
1615979583,"Wait, what dump?"
1615979612,Yeah just looked at it
1615979612,Thought it would. You dont think it will?
1615979617,%0.76
1615979620,Dump?
1615979627,You should see 20k to 5k
1615979635,Then you will know what is dump xD
1615979716,"It bounced off its support perfectly, we are now to see what its next move will be"
1615979736,@That one belgian super cunt You escaped liquidation right?
1615979816,yeah he did
1615979864,Still not dumping i hope?
1615979890,what dump
1615979917,https://tenor.com/view/let-me-check-my-crystal-ball-crystal-ball-psychic-fortune-teller-medium-gif-19435340
1615979927,Not sure😂
1615979936,I bought back in
1615979970,I've finally decided. I hate BTC more than i hate K
1615979977,So how do I lower my liquidity value? buying again at lower dips
1615979984,Yup
1615979994,Or you can add more margin
1615980149,Never mind. Seems to be just bouncing off the BB;s
1615980171,"Yeah if you buy again at a lower price than what you entered, binance will recalculate your average entry and liquidity price"
1615980185,"Or like Cryptoknight said, you can directly add margin"
1615980310,Is BTC shitting on the market again today 😩
1615980335,Yeah it is
1615980396,"I’m afraid that until this madness with bitcoin finally stops, we wont have a clear picture as to how some coins are performing, where they are heading or what their new aths would be"
1615980428,"Like bitcoin is just going insane way too often, altcoins have no room to breathe"
1615980591,This is what im looking at right now
1615980696,anyone else jump on STMX earlier at 3c?
1615980704,nice little 20% rise
1615980728,Im here with that green portfolio😈😈😈
1615980798,well there's an ATH for STMX
1615981298,"So am i actually  🤣 
Got on this train early"
1615981362,if you are 100% in ENJ
1615981365,how can you be green today lol
1615981370,did you short it? :p
1615981441,Cause i got in early. Before i started shilling
1615981452,Not green today tho.
1615981456,Green overall
1615981461,Im an alien
1615981464,if you are red in this market
1615981472,then you have an issue :p
1615981491,been in since the 28th feb and added everyday since so i'm always green atm
1615981495,That image is ingrained in my memory somewhere and I can’t seem to figure out why? Is it just some random jump scare image? And I think it represents BTC v well hahaha
1615981515,Exactly. Thought it was apt. Fucking BTC
1615981531,Lol
1615981539,"Actually, overall since the beginning, i AM red. Lost 50% on doge early on pulling off a Belgium cunt."
1615981566,"It's from The Exorcist, a classic movie"
1615981591,"No its not. Its from BitCoin, a classic"
1615981604,"Also, Hey!"
1615981612,That's the worse modern remake
1615981627,My dad’s told me to watch that
1615981649,The Exorcist is a parody of BitCoin
1615981654,"If you would listen to your dad, you would know where the image was from 😃"
1615981666,https://cryptobriefing.com/enjin-nfts-power-new-microsoft-game-minecraft/ This from feb but full details and official press release have still not come from enjin marketing team
1615981670,My wife would kill me if i did that to my son
1615981693,And rightfully so if you do that now.
1615981701,Your son is..2? Right? 😂
1615981708,Im thinking abou tthis. Also about tomorows event. It does seem to be coming in 100% line with the trend. Doesnt it? Even with this fall.
1615981736,His son is gonna grow up to a huge bag of enjin waiting for him
1615981742,@bcdcdaz
1615981772,I dont think so 😩  Ill have to sell soon if india bans and criminalises it. Will lose shitloads
1615981782,"Hey guys , did anyone tried to enter a private sale of a token, does it worth ?"
1615981791,It worths
1615981808,Not really whack it on a cold storage hardware wallet

1615981818,Enj-hodlers
1615981828,Wait for the reversal
1615981828,Law states anyone holding any assets in crypto will be prosecuted
1615981846,Hahahaha. Nice one.
1615981850,As a joke tho
1615981851,can't prove it if its in cold storage
1615981873,No keys = no access
1615981877,Will need to look into it
1615981878,North Korea's law ?
1615981879,What if the law is going to be worded so poorly that you can sue your legislators for having a credit card balance?
1615981883,Similar
1615981914,"Doesnt work here. If i find a loophole, they will find a loophole."
1615981954,So you don't have a parliament and administration full of boomers who don't understand the technology they are trying to regulate?
1615982012,Has anyone told them that crypto can make it harder to trace bribes and gifts from lobbyists?
1615982012,Yep this is normal enjin action
1615982019,Thats exactly what we have
1615982041,They will panic.
1615982051,And stop the law
1615982068,"No. When they panic, there are riots"
1615982085,Whatever helps to take their mind off things
1615982087,"transfering all to ledger would be your solution. they cant prove what u hold and how muhc or u have one at all. not to mention u can say I lost it, even if they find some how u transfered balance somewhere.. and if u need to sale it, short trip to another country will be easy way"
1615982129,"Given what happened with the release of Alice, I have decided it may not be a bad idea to have at least 0.1 bnb in each launchpool. thoughts please"
1615982166,0.1 is not enough for it to be meanigful imo
1615982178,might as well convert ur earnings back into BNB
1615982192,in which case ud be better to just earn BNB from ur BNB
1615982224,Okay thanks for the input
1615982229,Moon in 10 mins (i hope)
1615982230,i got 0.12 alice with 1.9 bnb in vault
1615982250,"so unless you have huge amounts of bnb, you wont be able to farm much"
1615982252,Did you make from the pump tho?
1615982260,i was sleeping lmamo
1615982278,@bcdcdaz What time is the ADA listing? Like in how long. Hoping to do a future on ENJ first and then ADA
1615982302,damn ENJ ded
1615982305,It's already listed and opens for trading tomorrow at 5pm utc
1615982324,who is getting ADA now?
1615982328,A mate of a mate woke up to over £2.6k from his £100 investment
1615982331,So thats when the boom is?
1615982338,on what?
1615982367,"Alice, I don't know if he had 100 in the launchpool"
1615982381,that doesnt make sense
1615982383,"Think I’m gonna future it ready for the release tomorrow but I’m stuck between what leverage to use, it’s fairly stable right now but don’t want to get liquidated in the night if I choose 25x or something 😄"
1615982386,Thinking about it for sure
1615982409,Alice? Who the fuck is Alice.
1615982410,"That's when it will start. First books open and then they open gradually for more styles of trading, which should happen within minutes, and eventually Ada will be listed on regular coinbase which will give it another boost"
1615982410,"I won't be leveraging or anything though, but that brave yet"
1615982414,Not*
1615982431,So i have time until tomorrow then. ENJ!
1615982443,thanks to the guy who said he will long ada at 1.00$ i followed ur plan u legend
1615982453,"launchpool was active for 5 days only
I doubt he would have farmed that much ALICE with 100 worth of bnb"
1615982456,https://tenor.com/view/wink-success-boom-time-gif-12683549
1615982476,I'm not sure what the best time and rate to open a future on ADA will be. Maybe 1.21? Or will it go even lower?
1615982507,Same as I say it's not directly been told to me
1615982541,TP on ADA for tomorrow opening?
1615982546,1.18
1615982548,~~$10~~ $2.4
1615982601,Have you decided on your leverage of choice? Or do you plan to determine the price changes before to see what a safe-ish leverage is?<3
1615982603,I like my bullish attitde
1615982623,open ur longs before coinbase noobs tmrw
1615982659,Would I be considered a dimwit if I were to go chuck 100 dolla on Ada? Because I think I'm OK with it
1615982675,depends how much you have dude
1615982681,"dont spend more than you can lose, ever"
1615982688,but that's a fine amount otherwise
1615982688,Bout 104 dolla lol
1615982694,thats fine u can wait for a retest between 1.20-1.17 tho
1615982699,then tmrw at listing boom
1615982718,I'm actually off work tmoz too so I can give it my full attention
1615982887,Did someone say their liq price is at 2.19 for ENJ? 😮
1615982910,2.16 :p
1615982913,In my crystal ball I see a continuation of a pattern. Also asked an online crystal ball and it seemed to agree
1615982967,Wow on what leverage kittie
1615982980,10
1615982984,Ahhhhh
1615983072,if it hits 22 i will add some margin :p
1615983110,"Oh boy, good luck :p"
1615983133,jeesus
1615983220,We heading back down again?
1615983233,Obviously we are atm butt I mean badly ?xD
1615983255,depends on btc support
1615983283,Wheres the support we are hoping for ?
1615983428,If ENJ keeps going down I might miss out on the ADA party
1615983515,STMX ❤️
1615983532,What are the Chance's of turning a 100 dollars into 3000
1615983567,slim to none
1615983589,Well ig i am just lucky
1615983600,How long did it take
1615983610,A month
1615983617,Very nice
1615983627,Reinvesting?
1615983638,Yea but dont know what to go with
1615983658,Maybe theta waiting for it to dip
1615983707,Why not split it up over a few different coins?
1615983798,Put maybe 10-15% in 3-4 coins
1615983807,As in 10-15% each
1615983825,Then there’d be enough to take advice off some of the post grads here
1615983842,"Oh boy, is it a cross position? 😦"
1615983881,"As if that matters, the margin comes from the same pocket."
1615983934,Oh yeah :c I do hope it goes back up
1615984040,Good day fellow ENJ brothers and sisters
1615984056,How are we doing in this bloody fucking time
1615984067,but the dip bitch
1615984070,Here w4 go
1615984071,buy reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1615984083,Fucking runnnnnnn
1615984099,Although i predicted it.... Looking at 4h chart it was almost inevitable it would dip to 2.2
1615984172,Srsly take a look at 4h chart and zoom out
1615984176,Its beautifull
1615984182,Yeah like I say I'm in on 2.25 with 100 on a 50x so let's go
1615984184,We should be going up now
1615984188,What’s a good entry point for a sexy little ADA long?
1615984233,Depends on leverage.... I expect a steady increase all day because of tomorrows coin listing
1615984272,2.16 liquidation...... Had to add some margin
1615984307,Hmm
1615984312,Bro my margin still 2.23
1615984333,Mine was 2.28 i barely made in time to move it back
1615984347,Here it is overlaid with BTC chart

1615984409,
1615984456,"Picked cross instead of isolated ffs, only went in with a bit to practice"
1615984494,I had to exit futures for a bit to rest my nerves
1615984527,ZIL might break its previous ath
1615984566,Also it will probably get listed on cb pretty soon
1615984576,You don’t think ADA will go below 1.1?
1615984611,I hope not but am watching very closely
1615984627,if it does I am selling my ada and setting a higher leverage long
1615984675,which alt coin is the best for scalping
1615984682,DN
1615984690,"Hmm, is it too early to enter ADA now, it’s still over 24 hours away 🤔"
1615984701,no such thing as too early

1615984792,who with me
1615984863,"Hey guys , is Pi coin a scam ?"
1615984875,most likely
1615984887,if not gonna probably be some ultra low sat coin
1615984888,"yes, but @bcdcdaz is hodling it regardless"
1615984902,yup probably getting all his data stolen in the progress
1615984919,It's deleted now
1615984922,Where can I buy his data? I want to make better trading decisions. :kekw:
1615984935,stolendata.gov
1615984944,:kekw:  better?
1615984984,"He is more often right than he is wrong, especially concerning coins he is not emotionally attached to"
1615984985,I've got almost 900 pi coins
1615985002,Hope it's enough to buy 2 papa pizzas
1615985076,"people just casually downloaded an app that is nothing but ""SPREAD AROUND AND YOU GET A CRUMB PEASANT"" with closed source software and no idea how it works and what it actually does. :kekw:"
1615985128,Does that really surprise you?
1615985130,THIS IS IT ENJ BROS
1615985130,Have you read the information about pi coin?
1615985138,2.35
1615985143,Im at 1800 so far 😂
1615985146,yes and it doesn't matter. there is no way to verify wtf it does
1615985150,"nice, we're going up again 😄"
1615985155,And the others?
1615985164,😹 😹
1615985181,Belgian supercunt life is a gamble
1615985192,what? 99% of coins are open source and you can download their source and modify it
1615985204,we can peer review the code
1615985207,pi you can't
1615985229,we KNOW that say ethereum isn't actually downloading information through a backdoor
1615985231,Nad that means that's a scam
1615985237,most likely yes
1615985257,"when your entire marketing is free shit and ""OMG THE DEV GRADUATED FROM A POSH SCHOOL"" its sus"
1615985259,still no exchanges
1615985261,still no price
1615985263,still nothing
1615985269,just install and push a button
1615985278,Miracle button
1615985279,free money = potentially scam
1615985283,nothing is free
1615985290,Not free money
1615985294,That's explicit
1615985297,Your basically selling the data you used to mine it
1615985301,party pooper
1615985305,and I have seen reports of the app sending out decent amounts of data
1615985315,so its probably sending out data for sale to advertisers
1615985318,and data centers
1615985337,Like every app 🙂
1615985340,you all are earning them millions and millions potentially while you get a number that means nothing
1615985354,Have you been scammed before?
1615985356,yes
1615985360,obviously
1615985365,everybody has been scammed at one point
1615985371,if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
1615985375,I took your advice and trashed that bs
1615985376,facts
1615985394,The other day e gave 500 dólars to someone that said that would triple my money
1615985409,what?
1615985413,Still no news from him
1615985417,who?
1615985432,Scam alert 1000000x
1615985446,But I am a hope person
1615985447,if I want to trade with 5k usdt on binance I have to pay 50 usdt everytime I trade as fee?
1615985470,im not buy that dip
1615985477,5 dollar
1615985490,pretty sure the trade fee is like 0.01%?
1615985498,oh yea
1615985503,0.0075% if you use BNB
1615985513,0.5dollar then
1615985530,i legit wonder how much binance makes in a day on fees
1615985533,50cents ahahahha
1615985552,Binance is earning a lot
1615985569,And more and more ppl are joining binance everyday
1615985595,seems they make about 800 million to a billion in a year
1615985602,just on fees
1615985617,never mind profits from liquidating
1615985624,but then again when you win a long or short they have to pay you
1615985667,and tbh they probably have bags of most coins
1615985692,wouldn't be surprised if a part of the deal of binance listing = % amount of dev bags
1615985709,ok boiz i got 10 buck and a dream what am i buying?
1615985725,enj :kekw:
1615985735,hahahaah yes sir
1615985743,i dont know tbh
1615985760,who knows ENJ might go 80 bucks so that would be a decent profit in long term
1615985762,Is she back?
1615985770,I was replying to suyt
1615985773,lol
1615985777,ENJ is dead as fuck
1615985781,I am only at -20% anymore
1615985787,a small victory :p
1615985800,IT'S ENJ TIMMEEE
1615985802,-27 damn I was too fast
1615985807,i wouldn't be surprised if ENJ's fate is tied to my long. bogdanoff is watching me
1615985824,what make you say it going to 80?
1615985827,in what time frame lmao
1615985851,it was sarcasm :p
1615985862,he is watching all of us
1615985871,
1615985877,"Umm nope, you pay the rent anyways on ""barrowed funds"" so they dont loose anything in either situation"
1615985904,ultimately they get money/crypto eitherway
1615985908,if I buy in for 100 bucks and I make a 1000% profit even with like a 10% fee they would still lose a ton of money
1615985956,IIRC maintenance fee is like 0.07% on enj so eh they can lose alot of money on good futures made by people
1615985968,Isn’t it always ENJ time in here?
1615985996,@fffffffffffff loves ENJ times. it gets her ENJine turned
1615986012,Can someone do the “good heavens look at the time” clock meme but every hour is ENJ
1615986014,"You are mixing something here. You pay them back exactly what you barrowed plus small interest, they dont loose anything"
1615986026,Buying  this stmx dip

1615986073,https://tenor.com/view/confused-no-nope-gif-13134027
1615986074,with 5X margin buying you borrow money/coins and pay back the coins you borrowed
1615986084,i am illiterate sorry guise
1615986112,"You pay back the coins in case of shorting, and you dont barrow them from bank in first place"

1615986270,if it double dips you are fucked 😂
1615986280,na na na im b uy the dip
1615986295,The nice thing AFAIK on margin buys you dont get liquidated. You just pray it goes back up

1615986316,"nah nah, 5x margin on money you loaning anyway

1615986342,https://tenor.com/view/duh-well-judge-judy-obviously-gif-13643427
1615986345,What time does ADA go on Coinbase?
1615986357,So... I barrow 500€ bucks from you add 100€ my own and buy coins. If the price goes down and burns my 100€ i get liquidated and sell my coins to get 500€ to pay you back. If price goes up i get thw profits and the minute i close the position you get your 500€ back. And interest ofc.
1615986378,9 PT

1615986485,If enj recovers i get half out and put into ADA long
1615986504,*when
1615986524,Yes corrext
1615986526,I suspect that ENJ is going to a new ATH within 15 min after I eventually fud out :kekw:
1615986528,depends on entry might be risky since adding to your long now would average buy in price
1615986529,When enj rexovers
1615986565,@SeineJanie Thats what she said
1615986603,True. But i might close current position and choose lower leverage so that liquidation price would be under 1.00
1615986607,ohhhh i got you fairo

1615987186,This time though it’s coming to PS and Xbox - both platforms have had a lack of new or original games for a couple of years so I think it’ll sell well on each platform further raising awareness of ENJ to a wider audience other than geek PC gamers
1615987186,Enj

1615988146,why did xrp crash at 22nd feb when the hearing was?
1615988162,because people dont wait for news
1615988165,but act before it
1615988172,Because people expected it to be resolved before then by a deal
1615988193,We would have hit $4 if the Ada cb news didn't drop
1615988200,No fuckinf way
1615988206,Stop blaming others
1615988217,Everyone bailed for Ada lol
1615988221,No because people dont actually understand crypto and the companei and what actually goes on
1615988222,First it was btc. Now its ada. Next is eth
1615988224,🤣🤣
1615988232,Most of us only understand stonk up
1615988235,Stonk down
1615988239,Exit scam
1615988247,:dababy: i am mostly joking tbh
1615988250,I have never once blamed btc for any of enjin's antics
1615988286,eth is like a stuck step sis waiting to be fucked
1615988290,So you dont agree with enjineer thinking BTC whales are manipulating the market to keep enj under 3 dollars?
1615988290,That's btc crash obsessed @Cryptoknight
1615988318,No I see very little correlation between the 2
1615988338,"Its interesting to see how BTC affects it. And i've always maintained that more than BTC, its Kayne that affects Enjin"
1615988387,This how little enjin's dips affect me
1615988390,Well we see surpasi g 320%
1615988440,I wouldn't like to see him drive a car with a real engine

1615988524,this is so annoying
1615988526,They buy doge
1615988527,Cos they're all gonna buy alts
1615988535,each time btc moves a little bit
1615988537,ENJ drops :p
1615988559,Yeah. So. BTC is an alt too right? ENJ is not
1615988579,Well let's hope it doesnt take a dump back down below 2.26 ey lol

1615989614,Why is no one talking about bat

1615989636,@bcdcdaz and @Cryptoknight never reffered to what dollar they're talking about though so be careful they're not betting in Guyanese dollar

1615990242,I would suggest you start buying 1INCH/USDT
1615990244,Because you don't trust ENJ with your own money?
1615990256,Why
1615990262,Not easy to pull tp when 80% of your pf is staked
1615990266,"No sell order set yet, just enjoying the ride till we get to the previous ATH"

1615990628,nah that's perfect I didn't have time to get on the train yet
1615990639,just finished KYC
1615990693,I didn't hit these yet which is my futures play fund
1615990741,also this one
1615990812,So Holo done cooling off?
1615990879,Why is ENJ going down. I was told $50 EoW guaranteed
1615990882,IIRC anybody can use this its just a stupid no risk betting game. no money exchanged
1615990940,It's a pullback xD
1615990949,"To talk about something else: **ADA**. I would guess that the best entry price we can hope for now is around 1,23$ and we can expect an increase of *at least* 15% tomorrow within the first 20-30 minutes after 4pm when books open at coinbase, potentially even seeing 2$ once public trading starts later that evening. 🔮  What are your thoughts?"
1615990993,You really think ADA will sustain this? It was trading just over $1 before the CB news.
1615991015,I am keeping my long position until it comes down to under 1.1 at which point il probably 30 X it
1615991021,https://tenor.com/view/me-too-goofy-crazy-do-it-again-gif-14862718
1615991042,"But it wont, will it? That seems steep"
1615991049,Oh wait that’s the dude that blocked me. I guess he probably won’t reply then lol
1615991073,enj is down like one third of its ATH almost
1615991082,"Nice prediction, have coinbase always listed it on the regular coinbase website the same day they list it on coinbase pro? Because I heard on Twitter it could be 2 days but that was some rando"
1615991084,ada can go down 15% easily
1615991105,Im not really worried. This is just a cross between what Jan said and what Daz predicted. Both can be right about it as far as in concerned
1615991122,WOah! Shorting it!
1615991144,Thats like 750% one way
1615991175,"As far as I understood they open for trading on regular coinbase once a certain volume has been reached at coinbase pro. That can take days, but I doubt that it will take days for ADA."
1615991208,Is $2 for ADA an achievable target or is that pure pipe dream?
1615991217,absolutely achievable IMHO
1615991221,Definitely achievable
1615991221,HUH
1615991224,"Yeah for sure, okay that’s pretty interesting then, not sure whether to long today or wait until tomorrow morning"
1615991232,ezpz
1615991235,i can see 10 bucks ada
1615991251,Tomorrow afternoon/evening will be a huge demand for ADA so it might crack the 2$ mark. But it will probably not stay up there very long.
1615991260,I had that dream once but in like years
1615991262,smart contracts probably in apil will be a big boost
1615991263,Now I am bitter
1615991274,Hello
1615991287,you gonna sell us a 1000% profit increase with your signals ?
1615991303,why would people wait untill then to buy?
1615991311,if they already know today
1615991311,No he has 12BTC and doesnt knowo what to do with it
1615991312,"7 day apy 1%
does this mean that after 7 days you cna expect a 1% increase ?"
1615991318,They have to if they are trading on coinbase.
1615991339,Anyone has purchased cointracking lifetime license?
1615991340,"no, its 7% per year pro rato"
1615991345,for 7 days then
1615991353,"No, what is that?"
1615991360,can you give me the math on that
1615991373,just so i can understand it and apply it to other stuff
1615991392,Safemoon bois
1615991394,"to track my wallets and taxes, im from a UE country and i need this software to calculate my taxes"
1615991488,Ok. Why do you ask
1615991500,I really hope that ENJ keeps somewhat stable where it is now and ADA performs well and I don't miss the right exit for ADA. Then I can add the profits from there to the margin of ENJ. :kekw:
1615991517,I like you. A lot
1615991517,actually its 1% per year that you can receive in 7 days as it says 1% APR(Annual Percent Rate)
1615991548,oh yea
1615991551,I misread that sorry
1615991567,thats a bad deal no?
1615991569,no bro you put more into ada
1615991572,or approximately 0.019% increase per week
1615991573,actually good coin
1615991586,Its not a good deal
1615991592,BAT is looking awesome for futures right now
1615991604,but no @CryptoEstrategy+ none of us use that software
1615991610,i had sent from binance to a ledger a quantity of btc and in cointracking doesn't list that transaction
1615991627,"I will, once I can cash out of ENJ"
1615991634,check the binance transaction on their website. that should have the TX
1615991634,you are better off keeping it free and utilizing it then locking it down; you can get a better APR just putting it in a stable stock
1615991639,I dont think any of us know that software man.
1615991664,ty jeremy

1615991945,What do you mean 'keep it locked up'?
1615991957,no movement
1615991979,"everytime you move crypto say from exchange to exchange its considered a ""stock movement"""
1615991993,so essentially I would need to keep it on a place that can cash out for a year
1615991998,Doesnt work like this when you're working with big numbers
1615992005,"In spain if you has >700.000€ in any financial product you should declare them, and i had a trouble with cointracking that is that there are transactions making error my portfolio"
1615992042,I doubt il ever have over 700K. if I did I would ejaculate so hard the US would feel it
1615992045,You MUST declare them. Cant not. Though i believe theres a loop hole where the price of your BTC can be tampered with. Check with your accountant
1615992098,"Also, its 500k eur i think. Not 700k"
1615992133,"Yes, i talked about that, the problem is cointracking shit, it's very dificul track de transactions in a excel, coinbase & binance don't offer assistance with declaration taxes in EU countries, only in the US"
1615992176,"And cointracking support departmente it's very slow and they told me that it's error with my csv, and all the csv are the same"
1615992180,"The declaration is arbitrary as far as i know. Mostly because if you pay tax when BTC is 60K, and the next day it falls to 45K, that is the loophole."
1615992199,Even if you dont pay anything upfront
1615992210,Check with a proper accountant. There are lots of pitfalls here
1615992218,"The declaration it's any change of a crypto to a other crypto, selling cryptos or buying something with cryptos"
1615992268,The tax system in Spain is oppressive and complex
1615992276,"No, my point is, theres no tax levied anyway until you cash out i think. But the declaration cannot be in BTC. It needs to be in EUR."
1615992287,"Lol,"
1615992409,
1615992419,I like the ETH as fuel exhaust
1615992464,"Yeah, but if you buy real statemente using any crypto, you should declare the taxe, which is the diference of the buy price (example:  10.000 USD ), then, if the price goes up to ( example : 50.000 USD) and you have 3 BTC in your wallet. Then you buy a house which price is 120.000 usd by 3BTC, in that moment you need to declare the profit of 50.000-10.000 = 40.000 x 3 = 120.000 USD"
1615992510,Thats cashing out. Are you cashing out?
1615992548,you never cash out if you just purchase gift cards with it 😉
1615992562,Lol. Still taxable when you have 12 BTC
1615992563,"No, if you buy some bread with BTC, you must declare that profit if the crypto goes up or down, if it goes down, you must declare loss"
1615992575,But unauditable
1615992583,#tax-evasion-101 course opening soon
1615992597,if you have 12 BTC just move
1615992600,That's the fiscal system of spain 😦
1615992640,Just withdraw while on the open seas. You are technically not govern by any laws at that time so you can't get taxed
1615992644,https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-meme-gif-7715402
1615992644,"Yeah. So these records you keep and consider those expenses as cashed out. The stuff still in your wallet, need to only be declared, not paid."
1615992677,They dont care if you have 12BTC of 1200BTC. They care about how much you have in EUR
1615992680,"II cannot, the Spanish tax system says that to declare capital gains in another country you should buy them in that country, if not, the Spanish tax agency can persecute you and sanction you"
1615992684,Depends on the country tax laws. We dont declare Crypto Assets in America
1615992691,we only declare crypto gains
1615992698,alternatively
1615992699,Capital gains doesnt apply to assets unsold bro
1615992700,which only come from selling to fiat
1615992702,you can go P2P
1615992713,just sell your bitcoin for drug cash
1615992717,:chad:
1615992726,"I have some ENJ, can I get some weed off you?"
1615992740,"If you buy a house, and the house appreciates, you dont pay taxes on the appreciation. you only pay taxes once you sell the house."
1615992746,claim you lost your crypto write it off as a loss and have all that undeclared cash
1615992750,"In Spain, a capital gain on a financial asset is considered a capital gain in the tax of individuals"
1615992779,"Fun fact, you can't declare capitol losses on crypto in america"
1615992794,How the hell do you calculate capital gains on unsold assets? valuation happens only once you establish the value with a sale?!?!?
1615992821,"It is that the tax you pay in my case is not the revaluation of the house, but rather the capital gain of the cryptocurrency that you must declare incorrectly when acquiring something with it."
1615992823,"You can take BTC as 60K today, but tomorrow it could be 40K."
1615992858,"It doesn't make sense, but the tax system in Spain is like this"
1615992860,Aquiring something with it means selling out. You dont need a crypto tracker for that.
1615992863,tomorrow its actually going to be 5$. I plan on dumping my entire supply of BTC tomorrow and its going to crash the market
1615992874,satoshi that you?
1615992881,Please dont. Need ENJ to do well
1615992892,Thats a scary thought
1615992898,I wish
1615992904,"just short BTC before he does it, that will send your margin to the moon 😄"
1615992905,imagine if satoshi is alive
1615992912,but he is waiting for 100K to just DUMP ALL of his BTC
1615992921,Barely. Cant short for more than 100$
1615992934,do you know how much percent 57K to 5 dollar is
1615992935,100$ 125x is 12500$
1615992945,What do you mean? Then who's dominus?
1615992948,I am
1615992956,you think I am running away but I am just chilling
1615992957,Thats my buy in to ENJ
1615992968,0.00008%
1615993050,imagine 125X shorting BTC and it goes down 10%$
1615993088,btw 0.00008% is a 8000000% gain
1615993107,"So today I am learning about moving averages. If I look back in the history I kind of understand and see a trend. Like for BTC if it hits a 200 period average, it generally goes up 40%ish over the next while. And if the 50 period goes above the 25 period average, we are generally in a downtrend (and inverse).
Like cool it works in theory and for historic data, but I am wondering how useful these trends actually are and if anyone has been able to reliably trade on them in the past.
Also reason why I am asking is because I currently think I see something that may say that BTC will be going down even more by tomorrow afternoon."
1615993125,"100,000,000,000$ USDT"
1615993128,What do you think about ADA tomorrow? Listing on CoinBase Pro (still pump?)
1615993152,"I would guess that the best entry price we can hope for now is around 1,23$ and we can expect an increase of at least 15% tomorrow within the first 20-30 minutes after 4pm when books open at coinbase, potentially even seeing 2$ once public trading starts later that evening.  What are your thoughts?"
1615993155,new ATH
1615993157,Cryptos are not a financial asset in Belgium
1615993161,its not even a currency :p
1615993173,its barely an asset
1615993175,"Enjin has lost 12% in a day after a 60% weekly rise, that looks like healthy correction to me"
1615993182,"I personally think it would be a semi decent medium leverage trade. I think it would be a really fun drunk max leverage trade that would likely be liquidated. I think regardless, it will pump and dump"
1615993224,I have an entire bottle of jack and a fresh stimmy check. its gonna be an intersting night
1615993231,Ill let you guys know if I survive 😂
1615993253,Have fun
1615993254,i just dont know if its gonna go down before the pump
1615993264,@bcdcdaz  D0 we expect it to settle down abit now then
1615993276,honestly I expected it to go down by now
1615993280,what do u guys think about BAT
1615993297,Yes she often does this and recovers throughout the day
1615993314,Nice thanks mate
1615993323,I'm still holding my position
1615993330,i have no choice but to hodl
1615993334,She's bound to get down after @Cryptoknight  keeps ramming her ass
1615993342,Hahaha
1615993365,Theres always a choice 👀 Gotta liquidate your losses and turn them into gains on DOGE 😂
1615993368,HEY! You rammed it first!
1615993386,Ill see myself out after that joke. It went too far

1615993413,I'm just gonna chill with it till enj hits 2.9
1615993414,BTC testing the 54k support again nice

1615993423,"Yes I think 1.5 easy and after, I don't know, I hope 2$ with the hype"
1615993442,"the people that predicted a stimilus effect, nope"
1615993472,people thinking a bunch of peasants are gonna make a difference
1615993473,A lot of us still havent gotten our stimmys 😦
1615993482,and anyway the zoomers are all buying doge for the meme
1615993489,and millenials
1615993495,because DADDY CULT LEADER ELON
1615993504,This is true. Doge did go up a bit on the weekend
1615993514,right before the BTC crash of course
1615993521,yes but rh now have a wallet
1615993529,then it crashed like everything else
1615993533,if you hit your liquidation price does it liquidate your position fully or just partially?
1615993540,Fully
1615993544,All money goes
1615993549,and you get a nice text message
1615993553,good guy binance
1615993570,Had my 1st one yesterday lol
1615993575,You might even get a warning text at 80% if binance thinks it wants to be extra nice
1615993575,I'll have yall know I had a nice bit of beginner traders partly thanks to doge
1615993591,my first time the 80% one and the other one were the same time lol
1615993599,it went quickly 😂
1615993609,Isn’t it already listed?
1615993609,First weekend I put 15 quid in and had 300usd a day n half later
1615993611,Big dump
1615993618,pump
1615993622,I was shorting ENJ
1615993631,3.07 was liquidation point
1615993636,3.08 ATH
1615993639,FML
1615993645,Ouch
1615993646,Wow
1615993648,It's only listed on coinbase pro and not open for trading yet
1615993666,Oh that pump wasn’t even from being fully live lol?
1615993677,that was just the prelude
1615993681,wow iv only had 6 liquidations in my futures career
1615993682,This is a really good idea though. You just got unlucky
1615993688,thats a much smaller number than I expected
1615993697,check SKL March 9th-12th to see what we might be up for
1615993700,it feels like im getting liquidated every weekend due to dumb ass calls(alcohol does not make the right decisions PSA)
1615993736,Sounds dirty. Who are you calling?
1615993755,Your mother's mother
1615993775,https://tenor.com/view/dramatic-music-monkey-piano-drama-gif-5631330
1615993777,omg I hit my ENJ sell order
1615993777,My grandma? Dude!
1615993784,I'm out from the rollercoaster
1615993791,Shes a nice lady
1615993810,Lol. Spend a lifetime with her. Then we'll talk
1615993812,https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-squarepants-toons-cartoons-animation-nicktoons-gif-14827475
1615993856,im thinking good ol adaup is the way to go rather than being more risky with a futures play
1615993859,Which was?
1615993859,thoughts?
1615993860,Congradulations!
1615993872,What’s an ADAUP? 🤔
1615993873,So wut r u guys talking about
1615993877,just break even
1615993883,dont liked my postion
1615993884,I saw it a while ago but didn’t know what it was
1615993894,I will fight another day 😂
1615993899,I personally think lower leveraged futures is better than their coins to be honest
1615993928,still in focking enj
1615993949,if you want to be safe maybe a 2-5x on ada. I personally am going to do some dumb shit tonight when I start drinking so no one follow my lead on my leverage amount on ADA
1615993952,am I the abused house wife
1615993962,jeremy I am following you all the way bro
1615993964,I will likely get another email from binance telling me my money is gone
1615993964,noted
1615993973,I will get back on ENJ
1615993980,on a lower position
1615993982,450% on enj @Cryptoknight !!
1615993999,leveraged tokens (ones that have UP or DOWN after it) follow the coins direction with a small multipler
1615994005,take your profit you mad man
1615994008,en buy again lower :p
1615994010,Lets get that bag or lose it all my friend
1615994010,Ew no
1615994012,"so as ADA goes up, ADAUP also goes up by a higher amount"
1615994012,Hahah
1615994013,all or nothing
1615994019,"likewise, if ADA goes down, ADAUP goes down more"
1615994024,5 dollars to the moon xD
1615994034,-325% :sausagedestroyer:
1615994038,I wanna see this 😂
1615994051,buying ADADOWN would be the equiv of shorting ADA at small leverage
1615994058,"I love my mornings to start off with eggs, bacon, and a side of liquidation tbh"
1615994067,i refuse to get liquidated on ENJ
1615994079,every other coin but ENJ
1615994082,"if you're not -1000%, are you even trying"
1615994092,considering my margin is 1200
1615994095,Enj will carry on up it got to xD
1615994107,EVEN THOUGH THE ORIGINAL BUY WAS LESS THAN A 100 BUCKS :kekw:
1615994131,I am so fucking stupid and retarded but I will hodl
1615994143,i will succeed I will make 2.5K out of this shit coin
1615994183,That's the spirit!
1615994198,and probably buy some ENJ for long term holding for pure ironiy
1615994214,or take my gains. and do ANOTHER ONE  :kekw:
1615994324,If you don’t want to lose money long ada but keep the liq point under 1$
1615994328,"on the margin you add, you dont have any gains on that right?"
1615994332,yup
1615994338,It doesn’t go lowet than that
1615994342,its just extra buffer before you get liquidated
1615994354,they should just rename ENJ to BTCUPANDDOWN
1615994464,file coins up a lot right now
1615994602,I just check STEX which originally had shield
1615994619,"16 days of green candles, she will not make me a liar"
1615994631,before I moved my shield to southxchange I was trying to earn some money. just logged back in because it was whining about me not being active
1615994636,
1615994640,:kekw:
1615994644,:godsgardener:
1615994671,casually found 0.04 BTC
1615994685,Not bad
1615994706,Time to buy more ENJ
1615994739,Guys what is a good entry for ENJ now?
1615994750,I'm sure I used to earn btt from torrent up/downloads but cannot access my account thanks to very old emails I no longer hold and the torrent ban in the uk
1615994766,maybe I should exchange it to some DOGE to move it out with less fees
1615994774,"Anything before $50,000"
1615994783,wauw
1615994792,lmao stop chilling on ENJ 🤣
1615994793,that picture is even more emimem
1615994803,what is everyone's target or sell price for ADA tomorrow?
1615994817,🤔
1615994832,not buying ENJ when it hits 2.2x is a crime
1615994833,probably 1penny less than it reaches
1615994862,you all going to watch it?
1615994865,ill be asleep 😦
1615994875,What time does it hit Coinbase
1615994909,someone said earlier 4pm** utc tomorrow
1615994965,https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/821523604578631711
1615994985,No just wake up liquidated again 🤣
1615995208,What entry price should I get Ada ? Like 1.15?
1615995248,it wont drop to that point
1615995253,except if they dump it :p
1615995263,Is bat doing a thing?
1615995263,or unless it does
1615995275,yea but then he will never buy it :p
1615995288,unless he does
1615995314,I will be passively watching ADA
1615995322,and cursing when it pumps
1615995324,Unless you dont
1615995331,🤣
1615995337,"Sry, thats annoying. Ill stop"
1615995404,"Don't. If you don't believe in it, just go for 15% profit. That's the least you'll make"
1615995437,when lambo tho?
1615995443,Just don't hodl until it's back down and you'll be fine
1615995450,Tomorrow evening
1615995463,sweet! I want aqua blue pls and thx
1615995463,Dont sell when its going up either
1615995503,Timing is the tricky part. After reaching the peak it might plummet
1615995507,eh profit is profit. I had a TP on ENJ at 2.1 from 1.8 and it went to 2.4 that evening but I still made the profit I was looking for
1615995540,Missing out on a bit of potential profit to take the safe route of getting out with some of the bag is always a good idea
1615995551,Suppose so
1615995587,Its safer than what a lot of people want because you aren't getting off at the tippy top of the mountain but thats ok too
1615995618,live to trade another day. No event in crypto is exclusive. There will always be another coin spike
1615995856,"Thinking about adding an ADA futures now in case the price goes up tomorrow during the day, might set a 15-25x leverage and get my liq price to under 1.10, idk tho"
1615995939,i set TP at 1.41
1615995946,
1615995982,I tried to get it in $ but it wouldn't change

1615997072,the value of ENJ going up and down rapidly?
1615997092,Enj is a shitcoin
1615997098,I almost got liquidated

1615997488,About the enj price and the 6 hour bet
1615997523,Maybe cos I can't remember 🤣
1615997590,daz. Mirroring Enjin Coins from wallet to the Jumpnet is probably what it means
1615997591,ask @That one belgian super cunt I was also 1cent off target for him
1615997686,technically you went above on the ATH

1615997917,Do you know what the medical procedure is to stop shilling this coin?
1615997921,I will say 2.38 seems rather inticing but I shall take a step back as I think there is a high chance it will drop lower
1615997930,An ENJoscopy
1615997942,I was thinking the same :p
1615997961,it BTC could take a little dump now
1615997995,Ba Dum Tss!
1615998009,I thought you’d appreciate that one
1615998011,Man it feels good to have a long market entry at 2.52
1615998051,yes but when she blows she blows quick 8% in a 1min candle yesterday
1615998070,"Like I said in DMs, it was 100% a grenade. It could only go up so much before she went boom. It was good profits on the way up tho 🤷‍♂️"
1615998098,Still on diagonal support level tho
1615998105,Thats the risk with spikes. They are really profitable but very dangerous if you get in the cross fire of the explosion
1615998223,"If bitcoin behaves fine, we should see a steady climb back to it's ath in the next 2-3 days"
1615998239,Everything above that seems off for now
1615998242,"Welp i believed in reaching $3 again, guess it was a dream all along"
1615998253,It's still making higher lows isnt it
1615998264,On the 15
1615998284,It can still make it to 3$ but the time frame is uncertain
1615998290,Been touching the support level 2 times today
1615998298,Might go for a third one
1615998311,Wheres are support ?

1615998791,keep going
1615998841,so how about those ada prices amirite?
1615998883,ADA is THE bae
1615998903,"The pump actually happened because I shorted it, not because of the announcement"
1615998918,"lmfaoo, are you long now?"
1615998927,"eating spicy peanuts with Tabasco sauce 3AM in Australia
bought in ADA about half an hour ago, living the dream"
1615998929,"if so, let us know 👀"
1615998938,I dont have any positions rn. Still waiting on my stimmy that was suppose to arrive today
1615998953,I called the IRS and the line said it was too congested at the time and to call back later
1615998981,well i thought that stimmy you gonna get was for ffff?
1615999031,"ADA told me that if I invest in ADA, that I would be able to afford more than just one woman's love and feet pics. Ada said I could afford a harem of women's love and feet pics"
1615999037,lol xelo would’ve just let Kanye keep trolling
1615999038,Poor guy
1615999050,Are you guys buying into ADA now loo
1615999057,Now? Way too late
1615999072,the real facts here everyone
1615999077,Yeah I'm staying away now or I will get burned lol
1615999109,"Its 100% risky to get in right now but hey, it might lead somewhere; honestly 1.50$ isnt out of the ballpark for tomorrows spike"
1615999117,just depends on if the spike actually happens
1615999124,it could be reef bonds all over again 😂
1615999139,Hey that worked for some folks
1615999143,How about VET?
1615999143,"Bitcoin: Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html"
1615999153,"""Big announcement tomorrow guys"" everyone buys reef ""Announcement is we are now doing bonds"" reef tanks"
1615999155,Lets goo
1615999168,It was actually really interesting to watch
1615999180,"I personally think anything below .10 is good on VET, but it is in the middle of a big run up too. May be better prices down the road."
1615999222,"price is high rn, its possible that it can set back to 1.10 ish"
1615999228,but you cant always time the market anyways
1615999254,"just an FYI for any of you who want to develop a crypto currency, announcing bonds when hyping up the announcement so much will tank your crypto 😂"
1615999271,ada will possibly see some real mooning after April
1615999289,I might actually 2-3x ADA to HODL for a while
1615999304,It sounds inticing tbh
1615999334,I ll go a bit higher leverage when it drops again
1615999346,I feel the same way
1615999352,"Smart contracts are so hot now, you’re right it could boom after April"
1615999352,im sure smart contracts release will be the biggest FOMO ADA had
1615999371,April is my birthday month too
1615999378,man would that be a good birthday present
1615999412,Thanks guys :)
1615999442,I'm still holding my enjin lol
1615999449,"same, 16th April"
1615999468,21st for me. Some years we can actually be birthday week buddies 😂
1615999484,Aries gang ♈
1615999504,Im actually a taurus ♉
1615999509,"VET, ONE, SMTX.  I’m in all three"
1615999514,Thats why I do so well in bull markets
1615999514,😦
1615999526,"Hey, can someone tell me how to get in early on initial private coin or token offerings, like what happened recently with My Neighbor ALICE?"
1615999530,damnn i wish i was born a bit late for that bull market potential 😦
1615999530,Same
1615999546,How did people know ahead of time about that launch?
1615999552,The downside is im completely fucked on bear market season
1615999563,Because the price went up something like 2400%
1615999592,"Twitter, their site, social media ect"
1615999595,So people who jumped in early made fortunes
1615999608,How do you know what are coming up?
1615999629,by then you gotta do pull out game on market...
1615999630,"The Binance charts weren’t entirely accurate when it launched, I believe. It wasn’t like it started at 10 cents a coin"
1615999633,"Most of the time these coins sites will announce it BUT if 2400% was so consistant, everyone would do it"
1615999659,Is there a place somewhere to see a schedule of what is going to launch in the future?
1615999674,Binance announcements
1615999675,mentioned LPT 2days ago
1615999678,It mooned today
1615999683,however they announce it usually hours before
1615999684,$7-17
1615999758,@duckie how did you find out about LPT ahead of time?
1615999780,You gotta remember some of these ICOs can go absolutely nowhere
1615999803,This one guy in a discord chat. Gives great advice. He told me about luna at .90 and lpt a few days ago. It’s crazy i usually never take advice from random people but he’s never failed me 🤣
1615999815,Told me to look into $scrt and $pond now
1615999866,I’ll add u to the discord
1615999930,Please add me!

1616000200,H
1616000229,whats the estimated increase that ADA will get? opinions?
1616000301,It’s really hard to say
1616000323,If during the africa conference something big gets announced
1616000341,20%
1616000342,And the same day coinbase listing goes live
1616000355,The price could skyrocket
1616000371,so you sell at that +20% and rebuy or hodl
1616000386,On the other hand I think we will challenge the ath
1616000389,nah I am more of a swing trader
1616000399,Even without some big announcement
1616000403,looking for opportunities

1616002807,Me
1616002837,There will be a pump about 20 minutes right?
1616002875,I thought it was to everyone
1616002882,But makes sense
1616003139,Bad moment to get in rn?
1616003155,BAT is having lower highs and higher lows possible breakout
1616003170,I don't have bat
1616003188,I mean Hot to get in
1616003203,Bat was just a statement
1616003217,In hot with 10 euros made 30 then bought 14 euros more
1616003233,I'm with 42 rn
1616003255,@felguerr so i found 0.04 btc on a old exchange. So i bought enough swissborg for the 2k rank :kekw:
1616003287,Should I get in rn or drop ?
1616003295,Looks like a launch in 12 mins
1616003299,
1616003317,:kekw:
1616003327,Damn
1616003346,I need to find my old btt
1616003376,gonna have to get a dns
1616003384,Normally their premium is a deposit of 50k chsb but you know. That is now unobtainable for normal lads so they are going to release a 2k chsb mid range plan soon. @felguerr told me to do it before it launches so I did
1616003403,"I bought a litle of many coins, hot was the coin that grew the most"
1616003545,Thats unobtainable for me and I'm not normal. Why you leaving me out like that? 😭
1616003597,😫 bbeh if you had only longed ada
1616003632,Thoughts?
1616003640,Ironically I had an ada long the day before that I closed in the red to buy ENJ. Don't I look like a dumbass now
1616003665,Only if you sold the enj
1616003702,6 mins
1616003765,The ENJ liquidated
1616003772,because of how hard it dropped
1616003775,SLP breakout TP1 5100sat
1616003793,Aha there you are SLP shiller
1616003820,Why didn’t you make me buy SLP this morning
1616003824,If you believe in ENJ buy it don't long
1616003834,But now it’s already boomed
1616003843,Even a good project is very empredictable
1616003877,I am mega longing after my tp $25 until $15 and $25
1616003898,There are far better projects to believe in IMO. Believing in a coin and buying to hold is a long term profit goal not a short term and there are coins I would much rather invest in such as ETH
1616003919,"The smaller the coin value, the easier it is for it to fail BUT also the more you can profit if it succeeds"
1616003924,I started one yesterday but got turned into liquid
1616003927,why do you like ETH
1616003938,I primarily stick to higher value coins because its harder for them to fail long term
1616003943,The balance graph on one week of my CHSB.:kekw:
1616003958,CHSB MOONING BUY NOW
1616003966,It's too  big to load
1616003977,it loaded
1616003980,@bcdcdaz  I hope your right about ENJ hahah
1616004000,So do I after locking 450 away
1616004002,"I like ETH because it's blockchain is what most coins are on, and it has exciting new updates upcoming that I believe will allow it to gain a lot of value. Its current issue is gas prices. The reason why gas prices are so high is because of the high demand. When the gas prices get corrected, if the demand is still there, it will skyrocket"
1616004021,I also like it because its a coin that already has a large price point so its a safer investment
1616004028,i agree on the gas prices
1616004032,Look at that 1 month graph. Look at the steady growth. 450 euro was already like 680 :chad:
1616004033,and its the reason i dont wanna touch it
1616004055,2.0 should correct those prices?
1616004058,If you wanna invest in a swiss call. Invest in CHSB
1616004058,Its a betting game at this point. Owning ETH is betting that the gas prices get corrected before the demand dies out
1616004059,"No, if you want profit you have to invest in coins that are still low"
1616004073,How many coins are you holding? I think i've to many
1616004079,This is absolutely not true and I have 4000 reasons as to why that is not true
1616004087,you should pin that
1616004088,she's going
1616004089,actually
1616004098,so we can laugh at it when btc hits 200k
1616004106,
1616004107,Anyone own BTC? You hear this guy say that you cant make profits on big coins?
1616004113,:kekw:
1616004117,Bang on 6pm
1616004118,https://tenor.com/view/spit-take-laughing-lmao-gif-9271317
1616004125,"I'll give you just one, in 2 weeks hot and storm x already quadrupled my inveatment"
1616004143,If chsb goes 10 dollar I will be happy
1616004148,Just got a buy signal for BTC on the 1h
1616004160,I didn't say you couldn't make money
1616004162,Yes as a short term hold. Low value coins AS I ALREADY SAID are riskier. You are MORE likely to lose money the lower value the coin
1616004174,You can very well make MORE money on cheap coins
1616004178,but there is FAR more risk
1616004187,do you know how many sub dollar coins exist?
1616004205,"Wrong again, you have to read everything about the coin you're investing and read the charts to buy the best price"
1616004208,A coin that hasn't taken off yet is far more likely to fail then a coin that already has a base
1616004222,what is that volume on BTC after a day of nnothinglness wow
1616004226,What are you doing here Jeremy?
1616004240,"Reading everything doesnt remove the risk. it just lowers it. The cheaper the coin, the more risky it is"
1616004249,There are fantastic projects that fail
1616004251,Jeremy is our local leverage hero
1616004256,"Wrong again, way more profit"
1616004257,i found kanyes second account
1616004261,How the hell can you do an TA on Storm its just 1 arrow vertical
1616004262,and way more loss
1616004269,stmx can just as easily go back to 20 sats
1616004278,"You literally didnt counter what I said, you just said way more profit. This has already been established"
1616004287,and im saying that as someone who profited off of stmx
1616004294,The more potential of profit comes from the added risk
1616004297,more volatile = more risky
1616004309,which is perfectly inline with jeremys point
1616004313,There is no MORE PROFIT without MORE RISK
1616004314,But have bases and can't go lower a point
1616004318,Wrong
1616004342,"Absolutely right and if you dont understand that, then have fun putting money into a coin that falls flat on its face"
1616004353,Like enj
1616004355,:kekw:
1616004376,Investing in a coin like that is like playing green on roulette its take all or nothing
1616004385,Thats why I invest in a lot of coins
1616004393,Finance 101. That's the first thing I learned from my professor.
1616004400,"I completely agree and that's where you have to research and still enter at the right point, way too much volatility at times"
1616004438,Someone who don't want many risks don't mess with futures
1616004455,Storm for example has no strong support level
1616004464,His futures is fuck it money
1616004464,It could easily collapse
1616004471,That's why I just put 13 bucka
1616004484,Hf quadrupling 13 dollar :p
1616004488,Now have 36 bucks
1616004497,Hot is the winner
1616004504,In profit
1616004508,So what are you predictions on Storm rn?
1616004514,Another peak or
1616004523,No predictions
1616004529,You can risk 13 dollar but to put 1000 in it seems like a different call to make
1616004533,Just play with a but of money
1616004564,If I lose everything and that's almost impossible just lose 13 bucks
1616004568,I bought ENJ at 2.35 but not enough meh
1616004573,Stupid :p
1616004583,I was going to buy ENJ
1616004589,Jeesus we still battling around 2.38 - 2.45
1616004599,Cmoon ENJ move faster
1616004612,ENJ started really well but that's bad too
1616004618,Only *10 with 150 dollar
1616004634,Should have done *20 🧐
1616004637,I don't long
1616004644,Just buy the coin
1616004657,My STMX is worth 390 bucks now :kekw:
1616004671,Why do people go to a casino
1616004679,For the fun off it :p
1616004682,You holding? seems like its going down tommorow
1616004684,Futures are way better
1616004699,That’s what I do?
1616004711,I am at the futures tab atleast
1616004714,Casinos are way less funnier than futures
1616004726,how tf is BAT worth more than ADA lmao this is wild
1616004727,you also cant buy long on most of the coins that are in your strat. Futures is exclusive to coins that have already been established and have a decent market cap to avoid P&Ds with leverage
1616004742,Im holding. It was like 100 bucks that i put in. So yeh
1616004751,Try to get burned harder with futures
1616004757,I would 100% long sky during its 3 day pump cycle
1616004762,too bad I cant
1616004778,Your english is broken and its very hard to understand what you are trying to say
1616004797,"I know it, got burned on futures"
1616004820,Everyone gets burned on futures eventually. Its all about minimizing losses and maximizing profits
1616004825,thats how you succeed in futures
1616004828,My phones dictionary is in Portuguese
1616004831,i would probably be almost a millionaire by now if i could 50x SUN
1616004850,You never know what will happen
1616004870,Which is why you minimize losses and maximize profits. Its called TP/SL
1616004873,Enj needs to be stable. Misses wants attention tonight
1616004895,"Yesterday shorted Alice at 16.2 and I have already went down to almost 14, and suddenly raised to 17"
1616004924,Say goodbye to money
1616004928,"Setting up TP/SL will make your futures trades more consistent with your TA. Sure its never going to be 100% but if you can reduce how much you lose, you will be one step closer to getting that positive PNL"
1616004949,You also need to appropriately manage your margins and leverage amount
1616004961,FET is moving for the FET holders!
1616004965,Futures are easy to understand
1616004975,The problem is that you never know
1616004985,Which goes back to my point
1616004990,.
1616004994,You can have a sl and it breaks and then goes up in an arrow
1616005011,Yes and that is the trade off for reducing your risk
1616005026,It's a gamble
1616005027,you dont win 100% of the time ever but setting up TP/SL is how you win more
1616005029,That's my point
1616005034,How long till Cardano is going up?
1616005046,which is why you put safeguards in to reduce the risk and make it LESS of a gamble
1616005049,Praying for it not going down
1616005053,Minus 27 hours give Or take
1616005068,your point is only a point if you dont setup the proper safeguards to cut your losses and maximize your profits
1616005068,I only do futures with money I'm willing to lose
1616005089,"If you aren't setting up TP/SL, then you are far more likely to have a negative PNL"
1616005096,"What should I take as stoploss for Ada, have school tommorow and can't check"
1616005096,Looking great from here
1616005111,Yeahh boyyy
1616005111,It entirely depends on your leverage
1616005121,Yesterday with 80 bucks made 670 with some
1616005132,Than lost all in that short movement
1616005151,Which sounds like a high leverage trade without a SL
1616005170,Graph reading
1616005172,And news
1616005178,My holding might pay off lol
1616005188,SL/TP isnt the only thing that is important when making your position. Your leverage amount is important too
1616005198,But that a mount was made in several trades
1616005201,Not in one
1616005203,Are you guys selling Ada tommorrow ?
1616005216,No walls after $2.50
1616005235,Wow so it should fly  abit easier then
1616005272,is your position currently positive or negative
1616005286,"That also depends on what you plan on doing and your leverage. I plan on doing a dumb ass trade so my advice isnt very relevant. Lots of people think that april will bring a lot of value because that is when they introduce smart contracts. IF you plan on holding for that long, 2-4x is where you are aiming"
1616005296,About the same 1% up
1616005313,Thanks
1616005324,"if you plan on doing a trade JUST for tomorrow, 10x would bring great profits if you do a 1.30->1.50 trade"
1616005326,"id suggest whenever youre position is positive, set your stop loss so you are still making money if it hits again"
1616005330,then tp to whatever you want
1616005333,hi
1616005336,hai
1616005338,Honestly I think 1.50 is a good place to exit for a short term profit
1616005340,Who all saw the amazing pump on Hotbit??
1616005349,400% and peak at 9mins!
1616005358,Still 180% up!

1616005569,Anyone seeing NEM making a comeback im still down 45%
1616005745,"Did that, lost a lot because it dropped slightly to my sl, and then rocket up again"
1616005764,I mean no lost but no win
1616005981,"Guys have you heard from Pi? It's a cryptocurrency developped by stanford phd's and they have 10 milion users already. You can generate this coin just by using your phone!

1616006329,Whatcha doing
1616006357,"spot trading most of it, small into a 5x"
1616006384,setting the futures trade for 1.22
1616006399,liquidation is pretty far away so im safe
1616006459,i think $2 is an unreasonably high number
1616006464,but thats where im setting my sells for now
1616006479,"if somehow it does get there, im only selling half of my ada"
1616006485,"actually, im not sure on that"
1616006500,i might sell all and try and back back in lower with less funds and stake it forever
1616006552,will mean my bags will be EGLD ADA NANO SYL mainly
1616006565,and CSPR once i get my hands on that
1616006575,My biggest bag is ADA
1616006582,By far
1616006595,its a common thing nowadays
1616006618,the guy who got me into crypto has like 90% of his portfoilio in ADA
1616006631,his best friend who got him into cryto literally only has ADA
1616006653,Am I the best friend of him? 😹
1616006669,except that guy bought when ada was 14c
1616006679,he owns a huge ass stake
1616006756,If I bought at 14c I already had 30k
1616006783,Please btc don’t kill ada
1616006805,Btc is the grand Master coin
1616006841,Finally
1616006896,Where do you go to generate this kind of picture ?
1616006910,Ada to 2$ would mean crazy profits for me
1616006963,
1616006976,
1616006997,Where on desktop is it though?
1616007004,Thanks !
1616007031,Are we expecting it to get that high?
1616007037,No
1616007042,Yed
1616007043,At least not me
1616007084,It has a big market cap
1616007096,It’s not that easy to double the price

1616007281,BTC taking off damn
1616007292,I see my BTC value melting
1616007304,btc getting pumped
1616007362,Hopping that Ada do the same movement as eth
1616007371,Burn coins
1616007465,Already said he wouldny
1616007489,He doesnt care about value more about the coin being used for good
1616007527,"But I care, and who buy it too"
1616007586,Then you just care about money and not the project. You should watch his videos. They are interesting
1616007595,But ofcourse a useful coin will go higher anyway
1616007651,wtf is btc doing wtf is this rocket :d
1616007671,and all alts chilling and waiting 😄

1616007715,Somebody here did say there was a 1H buy signal

1616008142,"She hasn't even increased in volume, this is all in game purchases"
1616008201,Let's wait if we'll see something in 2-4 hours
1616008554,This will be nice when bnb is back at 300
1616008733,Enjineer go wake up enj
1616008747,She’s sleeping too much
1616008861,Seriously @bcdcdaz ?
1616008908,Guys we are doing a pump on ETH starting now x
1616008923,Yeah that volume is the lowest it's been in 3 days
1616008949,The last time someone told me something like that xrp dropped from 0.7 € to 0.3
1616008975,Oh damn
1616008989,But we only doing it to see jeremys pretty pink toes
1616009032,Jeremy the eternal ethereum longer? 🥰 🥰
1616009093,Yes if u didn’t watch his ETH saga then my friend u missed out
1616009124,Owwweehh😢
1616009169,Is ADA still expected to drop to the 1.10’s?
1616009178,Because if so I’ll hold off on my future
1616009288,But I’m so excited for ADA tomorrow
1616009310,be careful
1616009318,I dont think it will drop to 1.10 not until tomorrows listing is over
1616009318,majority of ADA holders are waiting for tmr to sell
1616009324,Stimmys hit today. I wonder if we’re currently seeing that in the market
1616009326,could be a buy the rumour sell the hype moment
1616009326,Even I miss the ETH saga. It made every day a special day
1616009346,Need to dip ETH back to 1400 so I can start it over again
1616009363,Im keeping my x10 long until it really starts dropping. Then il wait for a more bottom for a X30 :kekw:
1616009378,I’m ok with that but eth to 2k first
1616009388,If tomorrow everything goes smooth you won’t see ada at 1.10 this bull cycle
1616009396,New bottom for ada might be 1.1 or 1.2
1616009411,Otherwise you’ll get it for 1$
1616009435,Smart to buy ETH rn?
1616009440,I can't tell when ppl r joking
1616009479,"Ah, that’s good news for ADA. In terms of entry points, I’ve got 2 strategies, both may seem stupid but I’m not sure 🤔"
1616009508,Depends on how long you’re wanting to hold it imo
1616009531,It's one of those things where im basically just moving it from my savings account to crypto
1616009533,If it’s a future then it’s likely a stupid strategy 😉
1616009536,I can hold it for years
1616009552,it was smart at 1400; I made bank when it dipped that low
1616009579,Its smarter for a long term hold now though
1616009580,You think it’s a bad idea to future tomorrow’s listing then?
1616009629,Oh no not at all I just think there’s a lot of reckless futures talk at the moment
1616009652,Anyone here buy into $OMI yet 👀 👀 👀 👀
1616009668,"Understandable, was just thinking to 15x now and leave it for tomorrow or to higher the leverage right before the listing and pray there’s not a dump"
1616009721,Just remember to put TP points
1616009729,and SL points
1616009730,Yes sir
1616009731,where the fuck is btc headed
1616009739,Never forget your stop loss
1616009760,"Pro tip, you can presetup your stop loss AND take profit marker before you even open the position 🤯"
1616009761,Is 50% a good stop loss
1616009784,Like they say btc to the moon
1616009788,stop loss is entirely relevant to your leverage. You will want a much different stop loss with 50x than 5x
1616009788,https://twitter.com/bkortendick/status/1372269196403478528?s=09
1616009796,Enjin have our backs
1616009808,"I saw that, but do you literally just put the prices for SL and TP of that the coin and it does it all automatically? Was gonna use it before but wasn’t totally sure how it was used"
1616009829,"You put the price you want it to SL TP at and when the position is opened, it applys that to the position"
1616009862,That's exactly why I don't see ENJ as a good investment
1616009880,"I used this to automate a ENJ position that hit its TP while I was away for the day. Did a stop-market purchase aiming for the end of the dip, left it alone for the day as I went to the movies, came back to a TP"
1616009895,Am I the only one who thinks NFT  is just a trend?
1616009905,But nft's are the future and also how Enjin got to where they are now
1616009919,The future how?
1616009927,Explain that to me pls
1616009931,"Thank you Jeremy, I don’t know what I’d do without you :p"
1616009937,"Its a 50/50 honestly. Regardless of if it succeeds or not, when it becomes mainstream the prices will correct from their insanity current prices. It could die out and be a niche thing though"
1616009955,Only time will tell if it sustains or dies
1616009964,"Can you guide me to NFT marketplace that uses ENJ
I know that rarible and others use etherium and that comes with stupod gas fees"
1616009966,But I don't see them as a need
1616009971,"digital content that is yours forever unless you, sell or melt it back into enjin"
1616009974,I see as stupid in fact
1616009986,Arent NFTs supposed to be useful in real estate and shit like that
1616010005,They 100% aren't a need but they could be seen as more of a harder version of a copyright/exclusive trading platform
1616010015,Like a tweet from Musk for millions?
1616010015,like trading cards
1616010017,"look into omi, ecomi, etc"
1616010020,for nft
1616010024,Trading cards are still a thing that hold ridiculous value
1616010026,Confinement are making people crazy
1616010029,"NFTs are dumb shit, but hey, if anything , last years have proved people are beyond stupid so..."
1616010038,"because nft's are made from coins, the coins that make them are locked into the price"
1616010052,I 100% agree that they aren't a need nor are they a thing most people will want but trading cards have survived this long. NFTs can too
1616010056,The touch is what makes things real
1616010058,Not saying they will
1616010081,Its less about the touch and more about the exclusivity. People buy things because of limited amounts
1616010091,look at csgo skins nobody believed in them
1616010092,thats why there are virtual in game items that go for thousands
1616010093,Dick Pic for millions if you want
1616010097,"Nfts are not made from coins, crypto assigned to artwork is basically a price tag"
1616010100,"if i made an nft now for 100enjin and sell it in 10 years I get whatever 100 enjin price is in 10 years, it's known as play to earn"
1616010101,Here pls
1616010126,* this is a good example of why nfts can survive
1616010130,not saying they will
1616010132,not saying they should
1616010137,but they most definately can
1616010138,You pay with enjin coins to make nfts in the enjin wallet and multiverse world
1616010140,I still not believe
1616010142,"@bcdcdaz 
Which site uses ENJ"
1616010151,Buy a skin when you can buy a real one cheapper
1616010153,"they're gonna, once VR becomes mainstream mainstream why wouldnt they"
1616010155,Wtf?
1616010161,Yep but people still do it
1616010169,no reason for nft not to blow in the next 50 years
1616010169,just because its not a GOOD investment doesnt mean people dont do it
1616010172,None. Just some games
1616010182,humans are stupid
1616010196,"bmw vantage app,"
1616010196,rich humans are normally even more stupid especially if their money is inherited
1616010211,Inherited retardness
1616010212,bmw points are made from enjin
1616010213,financial advisor carries the way
1616010215,"Absolutely right just look at the ""experts"" of the world supporting doge"
1616010224,Anybody got any info on what’s caused LRC’s 20%+ climb today?
1616010225,False support
1616010233,you can buy enjin coins with bmw points
1616010233,Yep and that is why I see a world where NFTs COULD survive
1616010243,Not saying they should or will. Im just saying its possible
1616010247,Jeremy you're absolutely right
1616010265,By the end of the month I'm buying 50 ENJ coins
1616010296,"Buy 50,000 of them instead"
1616010302,Guaranteed to succeed
1616010307,in a few months time you will be able to pay for a deposit on property with enjin coins
1616010314,No you wont
1616010324,Just like how java was all enjin all along
1616010326,If someone buys my dick Pic I may buy
1616010337,The app comes out in q4
1616010353,And eth 2.0 was supposed to be out already
1616010355,dyor
1616010363,Here comes the dyor
1616010366,Your research is broken.
1616010374,covid slowed a lot of shit down
1616010382,Fuck I don't know in who I should believe
1616010405,I disagree/ some maybe but the majority bang on
1616010407,Who has the bigger pennies has the reason
1616010418,Just 12 more cents for brake even on ENJ long
1616010427,I’ve got some massive pennies my guy
1616010433,Price increase 12 c that is
1616010441,"Like a hay penny, a straw penny"
1616010466,Long and thin or short and thick?
1616010471,😏
1616010472,That's the question
1616010482,Its making weak connection based on things called enjin. A ton of con men hyping it up to sell their 0.02 bags for millions. The bmw app isnt out for a while and its just one select country. Il accept enjin for gaming. No prob but buying houses. :kekw: btc barely has that and now some random gaming related coin is gonna do it in less than a year. Doubt it
1616010512,The man wins
1616010520,screen shotted
1616010522,Has a bigger cock surely
1616010530,"I agree with a lot of it, but you never know in crypto. Why I’ve got a small bag just in case."
1616010531,Go ahead
1616010554,Il accept 4 dollars. 6. Even ten. Maybe 15 to 20 in 2 years but not 80.
1616010569,"What about $50,000"
1616010584,@That one belgian super cunt tell me Ada values pls
1616010597,This man has arguments
1616010614,Not fool talk
1616010630,We are still to see promised 10€by the end of week
1616010636,There are coins and blockchains SPECIFICALLY made for housing and businesses like that. Their entire business is build around it. And now fucking enjin is gonna take over gaming. Take over Microsoft.  Xbawx. Java. Housing. Cars. The president.
1616010652,Of it goes to 10 I'm going to work nakes
1616010655,Naked
1616010665,And I'm a plumber
1616010671,ENJ to 10?
1616010671,Make your naths
1616010681,thats possible if there is an altseason
1616010682,Isnt thats what plumbers do though?
1616010682,:p
1616010702,2 to 6 this year. 10 probably next year. I see it going 20 for sure. The huge supply is the main concern but as btc grows in market cap the other strong coins going way up will be normal
1616010705,it wont stay 10 for long ...
1616010734,if I can short at the top of alt season 🤯
1616010745,Thank you my man
1616010774,I am keeping ada for probably 5 years. If we dont get a market collapse like 2019 and shit i can see 40 to 50 dollars if btc goes 200+ k.
1616010784,NFT’s are here to stay
1616010796,a market collapse is coming
1616010797,The fool arrived
1616010809,But it doesnt mean NFT’s from 2021 are gonna hold value in the next couple years
1616010810,Lol
1616010814,Just like alts
1616010825,Only the top NFT’s are gonna survive through the years with value
1616010830,But it's something worth owning
1616010833,You have something now
1616010840,True
1616010842,Buy a bit of everything
1616010846,Just like women
1616010846,It's like art bro
1616010851,If its a good NFT by a good group or artist
1616010854,With value
1616010861,Not just some random fucker trynna make money
1616010861,Always but it depends on how hard the crash will be. 10k? 30? What will be the bottom line
1616010865,And they got lucky
1616010869,Yeah don't buy some retarded gif
1616010875,I wish I knew Belgian
1616010877,Exactly
1616010883,that I dont get eliminated
1616010916,"Some people are gonna be punching the air in 3 years, when the NFT they bought for 1k is like 30$ or a 100$ NFT is 5$ 💀"
1616010939,the prices are crazy
1616010943,who has that money
1616010947,its like pokemon cards
1616010949,wtf
1616010951,Yeah lol
1616010962,I understand some kind of charizard is rare
1616010963,Crazy how many millionaires there are globally
1616010965,but 200k?
1616010972,Easily buy and sell nfts worth 50k
1616010974,why does a millionaire needs pokemon cards?
1616010976,"30k, 200k"
1616010986,Idk an asset
1616010994,Somewhere to store his wealth
1616010996,I guess
1616011008,for that chinese kid from that tycoon that is missing that one charizard
1616011023,I heard them charzards are crazy pricey
1616011032,200k I think yea
1616011040,Crazy 🤣
1616011045,Lambo or charzard?!?
1616011047,👀
1616011062,Ngl charzard would appreciate in value
1616011134,if I knew when I was idk 14 years old
1616011146,and I saw those pokemon cards and I was meh for kids
1616011157,20 years later I could be a millionaire 😂
1616011180,😂😂 frrrr
1616011199,but ok; its the same for bitcoin I guess
1616011230,if the young me would have browsed the dark webs and bought some
1616011235,A charizard obviously
1616011259,just the gen 1 sealed package are also worth a lot now
1616011266,you dont even need a rare card :p

1616014120,Not enough chars allowed in nickname tho
1616014127,Ahahah
1616014167,ADA is starting to get ready for its big day tomorrow
1616014187,this really feels like the forking part 2
1616014572,When are you selling?
1616014582,Im a long term holder
1616014588,$5-$10 for me
1616014594,woah
1616014599,ambitious
1616014630,I don’t think that’s all that ambitious
1616014635,"Not really. If BTC goes up, everything goes up."
1616014652,I think 5-10 is more than achievable with ADA
1616014660,Not like... tonight though obviously lmao
1616014661,Pump of what ?;)
1616014672,Dude that’s long term for some of us
1616014691,there is a serious FOMO on ADA now lol
1616014702,Yooo
1616014702,ada has a $50 billion market cap.... u really think it has a 5x/10x potential? lol
1616014703,You see Ada going 5 at the end of the year?
1616014707,Is it too late to buy into ada?!?
1616014716,Its at 1.33$
1616014720,Yep.
1616014722,Too late?!
1616014725,yea I think it is
1616014732,Fuuuuck
1616014736,You could grab some profit but not alot
1616014737,Fomo hitting
1616014752,I wanted to buy today at 1.23 but enj happened
1616014754,Current market cap isn’t a great way to predict future growth if you aren’t accounting for BTCs market cap to skyrocket too.
1616014757,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
1616014763,RICHY
1616014770,it’s what you deserve
1616014780,Why are u always here when I talk about ada 💀
1616014784,why did I cancell my *20 leverage yesterday to leverage ENJ
1616014786,😂
1616014790,on ADA
1616014795,Fucking ada to the grave now this lil bitch wants to buy in
1616014795,an hour before the announcement
1616014797,unreal
1616014798,lmao you all saying wait for ADA to dip to 1.22
1616014807,LMFAO u caught me
1616014822,i remember some ada haters here
1616014828,"Nah, that’s pretty unrealistic imho"
1616014835,lucked out by a listing :p
1616014869,well we will see luck after April 😄
1616014891,I think we can buy in again before that time lower then now
1616014898,@reqularhd what do you think ADA will do?
1616014898,"Ada pumped and dumped, hope everyone had thier stop losses set"
1616014917,move up a little bit and then people will sell
1616014923,Clicked over and set mine just in time phew 😬
1616014926,a lot off people on it now that are not holding
1616014942,The number one ADA hater got FOMO
1616014945,Yeah I'm buying back in
1616014951,God is good x x
1616014991,this bull run? 2X at MOST to $3. Even that is ambitious as hell imo
1616015006,"next bull run maybe $5 +, but that will be 4 years from now"
1616015008,So is it really hard to believe $5-$10 LONG TERM?
1616015016,define long term :p
1616015023,Key word I said long term earlier and you made that sound crazy
1616015038,in crypto world 4 years is a million years
1616015050,the total amount of ADA staked is over 22 Billion
1616015053,In futures especially
1616015059,To me 5 years is long term
1616015072,I held ETH for a week in 12x futures and it felt like a month
1616015075,I don’t think $5 ADA in 5 years is unreasonable.
1616015102,I’d like to see ADA hit 10 bucks in 5 years and I don’t think that’s unreasonable either
1616015118,$10 is a dream figure for me.
1616015121,"i agree that all this is not unreasonable, but keep in mind there will be a NASTY bear market in between"
1616015127,Broooo so u really chose to expose me 💀💀💀
1616015136,could probs buy at massive discounts during that years long bear market
1616015138,I for one can’t wait. Talk about some deep discount.
1616015147,"well u deserved it lmao, you shitted ada so much and now you are fomo'ing 😄"
1616015152,you cant wait to go -80%?
1616015155,💀
1616015168,not looking forward to that :p
1616015170,You’re damn right. I believe in the projects i invest in.
1616015191,how will I explain that to my gf lol
1616015195,💀💀💀
1616015201,U best believe I came with receipts x c
1616015201,its ok I lost 80% but its long term
1616015205,"Hey, only put money in you can lose"
1616015209,Man Bloomberg is shilling BTC hard.
1616015216,Hey Richy
1616015220,Lmfao

1616015863,"like, 250 seems right"
1616015864,but idk
1616015889,I don’t know what’s that in real ADA
1616015908,I didn’t really enjoy leveraged tokens when I bothered

1616016003,:kekw: LOAD THE ETH FLIPPENING THREAD
1616016015,Might see our third touchdown at diagonal support level
1616016017,Could go up. Could crash back down
1616016026,Same here. My CHSB is very green. Lol so and Ada 🙂 finally
1616016030,My opinion as well
1616016031,Or the Japanese save us today
1616016044,I would presume so it’s number #3 after all but we never know
1616016048,japanese will do harakiri
1616016050,I think it's safe to say that it's one of those two
1616016056,not sure this is the right place but i have a coinbase and would like to take my assets and dump them or move them@into binance.us does anyone know how to go about this without liquefying the assets
1616016064,or third option: It goes side ways
1616016072,Is it though? Because I’m sure I’d seen somewhere it had dropped to like 5
1616016075,dont forget the mythic loopty loop pattern
1616016087,coin's chart goes back in time to make a loop
1616016095,Yea okay one of those three

1616016266,But it happened precisely when he said 5 more cents
1616016270,so its his fault
1616016280,"Yes, I dumped all that money"

1616016619,gonna head back in after whatever is going on right now
1616016623,Ok so it’s just people buying for hype before the real mess begins lol
1616016634,Im officially in ADA
1616016642,Stonks from here boys
1616016646,ayeee
1616016646,what is likely to happen tomorrow when it is on coinbase?
1616016649,unofficially what are you in though 👀
1616016660,Bought at 1.36
1616016665,Welcome
1616016672,I bought most of my ada at 1 buck
1616016676,Got 1440 of it.
1616016687,Would of gotten more if i wasnt in enj :kekw:
1616016694,So when is this ada announcement?!!
1616016724,We dont even know if there will be an announcement. We just know ada boss is speeching in Africa
1616016732,9AM PT tomorrow ;p
1616016733,Which might be a deal in the country
1616016753,what's a good entry point from here 🤔
1616016757,He mentioned something about the birds again which suggests there may be something mentioned
1616016758,But if there is no big news. Ada dumps. If there is some big africa project. Moon
1616016766,
1616016776,1.27 liquidation is safe?!
1616016777,And then when smart contracts get added. Double moons
1616016788,I would do 1 dorrar to be dure
1616016831,what's ADA's ATH?
1616016838,1.48
1616016847,damn was close
1616016853,Which is why I said 5 cents more please earlier lol when it was 1.43
1616016880,"ah, haha"
1616016904,Will be happy if it sits above 1.30 before the real fun begins though
1616016941,What we predicting price after announcement?!?!
1616016961,Hollow reckons 1.5
1616016964,$50k same as ENJ
1616016967,at least 2 pigs and a cow
1616016972,Nah I say 1.5 tonight
1616016979,or an arm and a leg if it dumps :c
1616016989,Coinbase is tomorrow at 5pm GMT? Ish?
1616016990,What's this about ada and africa?
1616016993,I think 1.5 is realistic
1616017016,If we get news from Charles about any deals the price will explode
1616017016,"It’s .15 away, yeah 1.5 is realistic"
1616017045,"1.5 is a safe bet, 2 wouldn’t honestly surprise me but it’s a little bit more out there"
1616017072,Yeah definitely needs more news behind it for that type of jump
1616017074,"""Guys everyone put your sell orders at 10000000000$ so the people who short ADA have to pay us whatever we ask for it"" - some GME holder"
1616017094,Adafrica you must mean
1616017098,on a realistic note 1.5 is a good TP if you got in at 1.35 or below
1616017105,"We just went up .30 in 2 days, I think when CB users actually get the ability to buy we could easily see .15 in a day."
1616017109,"Maybe, but I also think ADA is one of those coins where when it goes it fucking goes"
1616017109,Decent profits especially leveraged
1616017114,"wait, you can do that?"
1616017132,If it takes an ENJ type rise I’m not going to complain!
1616017141,Well if no one put sell orders ever yet but no. Not realisticly
1616017144,But trying to be conservative lol
1616017152,Dude if you go on that sub now it’s clear just how many of them have no idea what the fuck they’re doing
1616017154,its like saying we can all boycott meat to shutdown the meat industry
1616017156,$2 isn’t out of the question. I can’t draw you a chart to make any reasonable analysis out of it
1616017162,"too late, done it, am millionaire"
1616017168,"in theory yes, in realistic terms never"
1616017195,Yall think 3 dollars is possible before like September or smthn
1616017205,A lot of the developments that are incoming could easily get priced in this early from people trying to get in early enough which makes sense
1616017216,Here you go
1616017239,Fax
1616017250,"Tough one dude, by end of year we could probably say yes, but we can’t predict everything going to plan right now"
1616017268,"I say ADA $10 in five years, anything between now and then could be fucking BRUTAL"
1616017290,Excellent TA😂👍🏻
1616017297,I feel like everything in crypto might crash again within the next year
1616017302,"Yeah exactly, lots of things that could hurt crypto in general, not just ADA"
1616017316,@hollowviper  love the chat looks legit to me.. maybe black sharply would look more official
1616017318,sounds like a sale
1616017321,Who do you trust more? My TA of ADA or dazz’s of ENJ? 😂
1616017346,Smiley face gives me the fuzzy feelings
1616017348,seems you learned from the master
1616017349,Yea I'm honestly kind of hoping that it happens because then I can actually start making money
1616017357,really wnt ada to droop a little more for when I buy back. Any reccomendations on a price?
1616017365,Both of you are very optimistic 😜
1616017368,"JRNY Crypto (iirc) predicted 10 dollars by the end of the year, or at least something high like that"
1616017373,Hard to choose
1616017381,honestly thats podium worthy
1616017383,I think anything under 1.3 now is worth getting in @scoggins987
1616017401,"I’m not romantically involved with ADA though, there’s the difference 😏"
1616017401,Lets just do it shall we
1616017416,👍  smashing
1616017419,You shouldnt let her hear that
1616017430,is now a good time to reenter for a 10x long 🤔
1616017449,ADA’s just a long weekend in a sleazy hotel
1616017464,Have you guys ever seen that white sweater with the Ada logo on it that Charles wears sometimes because I actually love the way it looks lmao
1616017495,"I read earlier that this is name after Ada Lovelace, but for some reason I keep picturing her from Xena Warrior Princess"
1616017530,"""We'll fix the bed in here I promise"""
1616017544,Ok enough chat about her. Let’s talk STMX!
1616017547,anyone know anything about Orchid (OXT)
1616017552,"Nah seriously though, I’m staking ADA but I don’t think it’s The Chosen One. Don’t get emotionally attached to a fucking coin lmaooooo behave"
1616017609,"fair enough, simping on a coin not a good move"
1616017668,You can get emotionally attached to Charles though
1616017672,We all will eventually.
1616017698,I’m in it for the long haul if I can stake so many coins on it. Even if it’s only worth $5 in 5 years it’s still a heap of profit for me
1616017761,Shame he can’t get emotionally attached to his hairline
1616017768,lmaoooo
1616017769,Dudes got a forehead like the McDonalds M
1616017945,What market cap would ada need to hit to get to 1.7$ rn
1616017995,55bn?!?
1616018005,50?
1616018120,Thoughts on FIL?
1616018514,closer to 55b
1616018561,I think it’s currently at 50 isn’t it
1616018583,"No, $43b. My bad"
1616018800,Why was ADA already pumping tonight? Did something happen?
1616018811,Anticipation for tomorrow
1616018822,That's it?
1616018871,Was there seriously a pump of this size based on yesterday's news?
1616018907,Does that mean there's likely to be a HUGE drop
1616018913,Quite possibly
1616018953,"I don't think i'm gonna future anymore with ADA at least until after the coinbase stuff has died down, i'm happy with my small profits in all honesty - don't wanna risk it lel"
1616018967,
1616018969,Jump they said
1616018975,It will be fine they said
1616018981,"If you got yourself a little bag before the pump tonight, you should be golden already"
1616018993,Someone bought into a huge green candle
1616018995,Hell yeah
1616019010,Broke rule #1
1616019015,Now paying the price
1616019035,In how many hours it goes live on coinbase?
1616019037,What’s your liq
1616019043,21ish?
1616019044,Im safe as fuck
1616019046,1.23
1616019047,Lol
1616019047,16 hours 50 minutes until it goes live on coinbase pro
1616019055,then we might see a small pump or a drop
1616019059,Oh 16 lmao my timing is well off
1616019079,then some more time will pass and then ADA goes live for everyone on regular coinbase
1616019085,then we will see another huge pump
1616019097,but starting from which rate? 🤔
1616019110,So about 2 gmt
1616019116,4 gmt
1616019128,So whole binance community is acting like a pump n dump group right now😆
1616019133,you gonna future it?
1616019147,"Yes, but I'm still undecided on when to open my future"
1616019161,I was in a meeting the last few hours and opened and closed a few ada-futures already 😄
1616019167,"1.34 was gonna be my re-entry, but i'm sitting it out and letting my spot ADA take over 😛"
1616019176,nice one man
1616019177,I have some in my bag
1616019210,You deserved this
1616019262,"The most upsetting thing is that I had a buy order open all day at 1,2301 and then ADA drops down to 1,23017, missing my order by 0,00007$. 😦 That would have been a nice bag to take into that spike tonight"
1616019294,"at 16:00 GMT time ADA should be listed on coinbase, if that's what you're referring to 👀"
1616019295,That’s rough man. Wish it’d hit for you
1616019372,"that's just how life goes sometimes :c don't sweat it, you'll probably make money either way 🙂"
1616019416,"0,00007$! 😠  But well, at least it came pretty close to my estimate for the lowest rate during this run"
1616019447,"that's a ridiculously small difference, I personally think binance should have just given it to you 😆"
1616019472,"but your predictions are getting very very close to the real thing, so I think that's more rewarding than anything"
1616019490,I had mine at 1.240
1616019500,Then I had to cancel
1616019507,Add margin to enj
1616019512,Lifes tough
1616019518,How is ENJ going this evening
1616019521,oh no 😦
1616019533,Great
1616019536,Stonks
1616019539,📈
1616019539,basically everything's up in the greens other than ENJ :c
1616019541,The ENJ dudes bailed I think
1616019549,One said he was going dark until like $6
1616019557,Up 100% 🙏🏿
1616019565,well that's good :p
1616019571,He’ll be back in 2037
1616019661,Heard that ppl are trying to make nfts out of everything
1616019733,Nut and make an nft
1616019736,📈
1616019777,NFT tits
1616019985,Just banged and ada still up 400 bucks. Nice
1616020032,Flash bang right
1616020076,ADA to 1000 😹
1616020111,
1616020121,🤑
1616020221,If Ada goes to 10 € before the year end I'll go every Sunday to the church
1616020253,"Nice, but are all of these confirmed?"
1616020263,What is a textComplete country?
1616020283,welcome 🙏
1616020283,Drahnreb don't kill my vibe
1616020317,At this pace ADA will be at 10$ before summer 😄
1616020330,If ADA goes to that price I will continue to not go to church because Charles is my messiah
1616020382,If it goes to 20 € on Christmas I'm going to the US on vacation
1616020386,"If Ada goes to 10€ before the year, I will convert that Church into an ADA cult"
1616020391,"im hoping the dump tomorrow won't be that _big_, but it probably will be won't it 😦 (if there is one)"
1616020419,Rome wasn't built in one day
1616020421,I think the next rise will be what gets dumped rather than the current rise
1616020424,Do you guys only look for 10x etc or also just a 20% increase and then sell
1616020433,In Ada we trust
1616020445,maybe man
1616020455,thisss :p
1616020468,How is Alice doing?
1616020479,That bitch liquidated me
1616020493,"We’ll know by the 19th whether any African countries have been confirmed too, so watching for Charles’ tweets or African blockchain conference tweets may be very beneficial"
1616020513,Get ahead of the majority of the crowd with that news
1616020566,Alice is in wonderland
1616020620,So okay I bought some ADA at around 1.02
1616020634,"Is now still a good idea to buy more,"
1616020654,Or should I wait until after the coinbase thing tomorrow?
1616020659,Ada is a long term investment
1616020697,Everyday is a good day to buy Ada
1616020740,"If you’re stacking, you should just top it off when you can afford. If you’re looking for quick profits, then before coinbase starts trading on it is a good time, but make sure to be on when it begins as it will be a crazy ride"
1616020892,:dababy: fuck enj we ADA gang now
1616020903,I think if you want ada do it now
1616020932,The train is starting
1616020945,sup all
1616020947,what happened
1616020948,Nah. There will be a sell off between coinbase and africa/smart contracts.
1616020955,this got more messages than normal
1616020967,
1616020975,ENJ got dumped for ADA
1616021004,"well, this channel has been all ADA before ENJ came along"
1616021015,so it's not that much of an improvement :kekw:
1616021020,dumped?
1616021050,It was a crazy morning full of liquidations
1616021054,Long day
1616021082,Welcome
1616021095,Ada currently on the verge of hitting 1.5$
1616021096,
1616021098,Enj :kekw:
1616021101,Great time to get profit
1616021113,ENJ is recovering and might actually finish this day green
1616021136,Is it good to buy extra ada now
1616021148,I got some money left in my wallet so
1616021157,if you arent paper hands
1616021177,you cant always time the market lol
1616021190,the uncertainty would make you lose all your hair
1616021196,True
1616021214,"Depends on your genes, mine is just turning grey ✌️"
1616021262,"hahahahah well i meant figuritively, but that works as well lmao"
1616021262,Yeah if i keep stressing my hair will turn grey in no timd
1616021271,did the enj sheeps dissapear now that enj is in an atl?
1616021278,why is it down so much anyways?
1616021282,i don't get it
1616021291,Look at the 4h chart man
1616021291,everything is going up except this
1616021295,https://tenor.com/view/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-ah-shit-cj-gta-gta-san-andreas-gif-13933485
1616021298,I think it's slowly recovering if you check the graph
1616021300,Tbh i think enj is going up
1616021304,The rest of the week
1616021311,yep
1616021322,how so?
1616021355,By TA
1616021362,TA? what is that
1616021371,Technical Analysis
1616021381,And I just got 150 more of ada
1616021395,Yeah bought another 125 myself
1616021399,@MotoMoto nice one man :p
1616021404,aye lets go
1616021420,Should be 11k coins total by end of the week 🙂
1616021464,They probably left us low level IQ cavemen to go talk how xbox will run on ENJ OS
1616021472,If you look at the montly chaft you can see it hit the bottem of trendline and if it doesnt break under we are really bullish
1616021474,man just wait for enj
1616021478,if it has to go up
1616021481,give it a day
1616021503,The fact it is potentially consolidating is a good sign people just too impatient
1616021504,If it doesnt go up in 3 days ill sell it
1616021517,ENJ will go up. Pretty sure on that and i will be ready. Battered  stressed. Tired to take the big risk profits
1616021520,But im expecting good things from enj
1616021540,ngl you had balls made of diamond to stay in for that long
1616021554,bruh
1616021567,@MotoMoto does ur TA says $3 or $4?
1616021574,so i cash out
1616021576,NEM on the other hand is still down 40%
1616021690,Id say around 3.4 dollars
1616021707,Pretty soon
1616021735,And 4 in a week
1616021853,My balls are priceless
1616021870,Now you sound like an enj dude lol
1616021917,I am owner of some enj
1616021935,And why wont I be able to trade it?
1616021953,Why would it go up 400% in value
1616021957,out of the blue
1616021987,4 would be less than 100%
1616021988,guys.. ENJ is great but it suck atm.. lets talk other coins.. any holders or thought for PRQ coin?
1616021990,400%?
1616021998,Its 2.5 euro rn whats that
1616022004,About 2.9 bucks
1616022006,100% is a doubling. Which would be 5
1616022039,Would for me be 5000%:kekw:
1616022041,well same thing
1616022053,why would it go up so much out of the blue @MotoMoto
1616022068,futures?
1616022071,Good things coming and my TA
1616022076,X50 yeah
1616022089,damn u really believe huh
1616022091,50x
1616022119,Should of done x 50 on ada. Would of been very very happy
1616022128,"Any example or just like the enj guys said ""to $3 tomorrow"""
1616022151,Well im not the rank to share photos and stuff
1616022156,Is always better to invest on usdt rather than bitcoin right? on alt coins and such
1616022161,dm me
1616022164,But at monthly chart its bottem of trend
1616022174,And daily itd ascending triangle
1616022215,Closed the app for tnight men gotta study have a test in a few hours
1616022219,Well ENJ is used in some games for dlc and items which keeps the coins floating. A new game using enj comes out this week. I think friday thus more enj flow. During the weekend game playing is highest. Enj afaik pumps most on weekends. Thus there will probably be a high push up this weekend.
1616022240,so u guys
1616022248,is it usually better to invest with usdt or btc?
1616022255,on alt coins such as ada for example
1616022262,What’s the difference?
1616022263,Whatever you have tbh
1616022269,I use eur bcs my exange doesnt offer else
1616022273,1.5 in btc is 1.5 in usdt
1616022288,Its just a different pairing / view
1616022311,If you have btc laying around not really worth going the extra step of swapping
1616022328,"With bots the coin pairing matters because it keeps going back and forth. I go BTC when it's bullish, USDT when BTC is bearish"
1616022333,Thouth usdt or busd is handy to place orders at you know. Values you know
1616022372,this is where we are with enj atm
1616022406,bullish means it goes up right?
1616022412,Yes
1616022471,"So I want my trading coins to go up  as well, if it's uncertain I'll switch to stables"
1616022669,i may put around $100 on xem
1616022673,stupid take?
1616022691,or intelligent?
1616022983,I lost 40%
1616022990,But its stable now
1616022993,I hope
1616023081,"I have really mixed opinions on VET right now, not sure to get a bag in or not :/"
1616023092,I got some
1616023104,No real expectations
1616023144,I believe it had some news recently that didn’t really change the coins price all that much iirc
1616023267,Yea i bought right before the snapshot and token deal
1616023272,Really dumb
1616023592,Going from 3.08 dollar ath to 4 dollars in a week would be pretty normal stuff for ENJ
1616023623,"Not saying that it has to happen in exactly one week, but it's not that groundbreaking"

1616023776,Leave daz alone
1616023777,"Apparently VET is going to be the backbone of all covid vaccine passports. That is *huge* and it had *no* impact on the rate, which is weird"
1616023779,Let the guy speak
1616023832,"I always provide evidence, I find it before it is public"
1616023837,"In case you havent noticed, lately he’s also been sharing news of some other great altcoins that have a very bright future ahead"
1616023844,Not just ENJ
1616023865,"Yeah, think that’s the news I saw on Twitter, little weird right? Considering this is on an international scale - he even said other countries are talking to VeChain about implementing this but again no spike movement, maybe all talk..who knows"
1616023900,Where can i Get DN?
1616023917,Think it got priced in other day. Went from 6.7c to like 8c then settled again
1616023933,Just not enough people investing I assume
1616023959,What coin poppin and what do you guys think about Holo
1616023972,https://tenor.com/view/leave-britney-alone-crazy-meme-gif-16709626
1616023974,It was announced in the vechain interview they did with crypto.com
1616023988,LEAVEEEEE BRITNEY ALONE
1616024002,But not much coin movement after that news which isn’t that reassuring to me :c
1616024100,"Crypto.com is tiny compared to the likes of binance, they don't reach as many ppl"
1616024272,They are also a terrible terrible trading platform
1616024282,I definitely don’t recommend using it
1616024324,Crazy fees poor customer server to nonexistent actually and just overall crap tools to monitor your assets with
1616024327,"Yeah, 3 days for verification, laggy af, bad support"
1616024334,Haha
1616024340,It took me 3 weeks to get my money
1616024353,They are making improvements on a weekly basis tho
1616024387,Why complicate yourself when we got Binance ?
1616024408,cos crypto.com is cold storage
1616024452,Not worth it better products out there
1616024539,"So what influences how long after trading on coinbase pro starts, a coin gets released for trading on regular coinbase?"
1616024621,Skip to 20 mins into the labs video
1616024624,ENJ not looking like a bad buy afteral eyy
1616024692,people are expecting way too much from it imo
1616024715,"Keep saying growth is organic, but want to see pump-like gains"
1616024749,Well said MeeM
1616024751,"u were literally the same dude complaining when it was 2.50, now is 2.47 and u say that lmao"
1616024770,is been in that price for almost 3 days without moving. Is gonna stay there for a while
1616024784,it was a joke dude lol i brought in at 2.25
1616024786,"And if it does, that’s a good thing"
1616024807,Creating a strong support around 2.5 is so so so good
1616024818,It creates a pathway to new highs
1616024823,yeah
1616024824,How is that hard to understand lol
1616024835,its coming to the end of a wedge pattern also
1616024851,"You just have to be a little patient, and you’ll get rewarded"
1616024853,at the pinnacle
1616024894,It also has such a great diagonal support line that has been holding for weeks now
1616024958,what even is that
1616024982,Flag x triangle
1616024993,happens often before a break out of either way
1616025000,guys
1616025017,"if these TA things were accurate, people like @MotoMoto would be millionaires"
1616025022,and it isn't the case so
1616025033,alright kanye whatever you say
1616025037,since u can predict the prices before the occur
1616025040,They are just to help you
1616025051,Kanye please
1616025054,And im onlu 3 weeks in and im up 20%
1616025068,your word is law sorry i forgot
1616025082,like others say they are tools to help
1616025084,Those just make it likely for an outbreak to happen
1616025100,And that can go eitherway
1616025125,So I don't get how we're not millionaires by now :godsgardener:
1616025144,what if
1616025149,enj goes up within 15 hours

1616025257,Hope that helps
1616025271,@bcdcdaz for Kyle
1616025276,"One will be featured on the futures tomorrow - should pop.  Also, I’m all in on stmx, ckb and xrp.  Check them out and do your research.  I’ll post a link about xrp next."

1616025437,"I dont even care if you do ban me, I'm trying to do ppl a favour"
1616025447,would be great if we could pump CAKE and help me get out of a terrible position Hahahaha
1616025465,"You’re doing good work, ignore the others"
1616025476,It's not me who needs you
1616025497,What’s your advice?  I missed it
1616025515,Take it with a grain of salt
1616025520,do ur own research
1616025522,buy enjin and hodl until they moon
1616025534,Kayne this group is to discuss coins
1616025550,Thanks. I have it and am holding.
1616025559,i have btc and enj
1616025561,"I just hope btc cosolidates for a bit now... no crazy jumps or falls.. that coin really needs a breather, it's been a rollercoaster ever since the 60k buildup until today."
1616025573,Im just trying that this group doesn't become an enj eco-chamber
1616025605,Agrees
1616025610,It should become a STMX and CKB chamber.  😂🤣😂
1616025612,How bout you bring up other coins then?
1616025619,isnt it right now?
1616025654,ONE will pop tomorrow (temporarily) after on the features.  Just like hbar
1616025675,STMX 4c let’s goooo
1616025689,"i mean a ""it will go up to the moon"" shilling type of thing"
1616025695,I LOVE STMX
1616025705,without even providing any good info apart from boomer facebook posts
1616025723,ADX pumppin
1616025724,at least give me an TA or something lol
1616025735,why?
1616025736,"I get stmx coins by shopping at eBay, Walmart, etc.  wait until they finalize Amazon"
1616025745,Cue the DYOR comments
1616025779,"Oh there was plenty of info. You are hardly ever here, wake up to ENJ hype and look confused and think room is full with shills"
1616025780,It will be on the featured on the futures tomorrow.
1616025841,a literal rollercoaster
1616025850,Stmx on futures? Well im in :chad:
1616025867,We were talking about it yesterday haha
1616025867,Isn't there 2 dudes that said is was gonna go up to $4 yesterday all day long
1616025881,and as soon as they realised they were wrong they shut up
1616025882,10 end this week lads
1616025887,STMX is the first crypto rewards program for traditional shopping.
1616025922,Hbar surged after they were featured - take it or leave it - don’t have to be condescending
1616025943,"Yeah 4.00 is not out of reach in forseeable future. Ofc people get overexcited, we cant and should not keep this chat sterile"
1616025945,?
1616025950,Just trying to share - you make your own decisions with data available
1616025981,Looking for a new stormx buy opportunity
1616025984,Kinda high rn
1616025991,^
1616026011,I’ve been looking for a good entry on STMX too actually
1616026016,I have been in since 21/22 satoshi. :chad:
1616026057,Holy shit my binance futures page glitched up for a second and said ada was up 99999% :kekw:
1616026094,Ah its just a sample for next week
1616026096,"I’m adding smtx, one, and ckb at dips."
1616026098,"I have an order set for ADA rn, u think it would be a better option to get in STMX"
1616026126,
1616026130,:kekw:
1616026133,Sell sell sell
1616026134,More risk/reward with smtx.  I’m long on ada though
1616026173,Bought in 150 dollars worth of. Almost 450 now. What a guess.
1616026178,Tried to tell peeps when it was just under 3c
1616026210,I bought in at .01.  I keep adding.
1616026215,Should i sell my NEM its down 50% for almost a week now and don't see it recovering
1616026240,hbar didn't even go up when futures was introduced @djtx
1616026257,Anyone holding coti or holo?
1616026334,
1616026344,
1616026347,Yeah ENJ baby get your ass over 2.5
1616026371,Sure it did.  Dude - you don’t have to slam every comment.  Do your diligence and take comments and suggestions as data for your due diligence.
1616026448,Kayne consider using the lows of coins as a way of buying in and opening positions on them
1616026480,Storm looking good but its quite high and getting FOMO
1616026540,i just checked the graph
1616026552,when it went live it only moved like 2 cents up
1616026555,and then it crashed
1616026565,https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/walmart-shoppers-now-earn-cryptoback-140951098.html
1616026574,Pretty bullish on stmx
1616026614,That was on August of 2020 tho
1616026626,Yes.
1616026632,Is stmx not forming a double top rn?
1616026641,Its a slow burner.
1616026655,2000 in at .35 fuck it
1616026655,Released a new white paper some weeks ago
1616026717,tbh I think the ATH of ada is not gonna be reach in a while
1616026731,"even after coinbase listing, normal people are not buying it"
1616026758,"ath might be tough to reach or break due to ada's current market cap which is insane, I agree"
1616026765,It was 5 cents off a few hours ago and the listing hasn’t even happened yet
1616026769,You cant buy it from coinbase yet
1616026773,"africa news, once confirmed could do it"
1616026807,Everybody i know that bought crypto irl all went through coinbase and litebit. The super mainstream online crypto shopw

1616028114,
1616028117,CASPER soon.
1616028122,adding to your margin lowers your liquidation price
1616028123,I wont
1616028134,Never say never
1616028141,new to trading?
1616028151,"I'm still not sure about what to make of ada for the next 17 hours. This is like an experimental rocket launch. Will it go to the moon, or explode on the launch pad?"
1616028161,
1616028165,It pumped so much already that I got a bad feeling about this.
1616028167,If i wasnt distrustful off enj i would of been liquidated a long time
1616028183,which is your price
1616028183,liq
1616028208,we still going dcb]

1616028243,oof
1616028267,Started at 2.49. Dropped to 2.38 or something.. Enjineer said it would never drop that low. Went to bed put more margin to droo to like 2.23. It dipped to like 2.34. Then it went 2.34 so now im at 1.89 :kekw:
1616028269,so Trump is into crypto now? Building walls and shit :kekw:

1616028386,3.2 sell gang
1616028403,139 sell gang
1616028409,
1616028418,"ENJ is going up and that's nice, but can we talk **ADA**? 👀"
1616028433,i expect a dump soon
1616028436,If enj hits more than ath and stays there. Im keeping my long
1616028458,because isnt it what whales are doing? loading up to release on those coinbase pricks
1616028460,Absolutely and it will happen in a few hours. But when?
1616028461,Chill. Every one cent doesnt need to be posted
1616028464,Ada dump?!?!?
1616028465,ADA is poggers
1616028487,what is poggers
1616028492,If ada does frash back to 1.10 i am going 50 X
1616028493,I was showing the different groupings
1616028505,why would it dump right before coinbase listing?
1616028513,50x up or down hhahaha
1616028520,after***
1616028521,I will fucking inject margin into it to 0.9 and i will fucking hodl it forever
1616028529,"A best case scenario would be that ADA goes up a bit after trading starts at 4pm GMT and then plummets to ...x?, before getting launched to the moon when trading starts on regular coinbase"
1616028534,Surely it can’t go as low as 1.10 👀
1616028549,why not
1616028565,I guess.. lel
1616028578,It could when everyone who got in at a good rate cashes out and then everyone else sees the rate dropping like a rock and panicks
1616028598,"So the ideal future is to enter during this expected dump then, but I also don’t fancy staying up until 4AM haha"
1616028614,aren't you in the UK?
1616028617,Ye
1616028625,If that happens it will be between 4-5pm your time
1616028629,k im out for today
1616028637,will wake up in like 7 hours
1616028643,hope you rise enj to 5 $
1616028644,❤️❤️
1616028650,or i'll be a lil upset
1616028671,Enj tree dorra
1616028678,Good night if i get enj liquidated tonight im nuking japan
1616028679,btw i always say this shit but then i use the phone till i fall sleep
1616028681,"Oh so you don’t expect a dump in the mean time? I was wondering whether to enter a future when there’s a dump before the listing tomorrow, unless we’re talking about the dump to be AFTER the listing, which I just closed my position for nothing lol"
1616028685,@David R. did you see the spreadsheet I sent today?
1616028710,"I haven’t, I don’t think 😦"
1616028718,Could you send me it? ❤️
1616028731,"There could be a dump before, but that wouldn't make sense. Which doesn't mean that it won't happen"
1616028747,"I did send it, check the calendar group"
1616028754,Ahh yes got it
1616028796,"Okay, yeah I agree it would be strange to see a dump before the listing"
1616028829,but now everyone sits with fat bags of ada ready to be dropped
1616028835,"btw i drew those 2 lines for enj resistance, might do something, might be nothing"
1616028848,"shoo, go to bed"
1616028857,volume is up 40mil
1616028875,not before my cup of warm milk
1616028889,"I haven’t had a chance to look at the volume in the last 24 hours compared to yesterday, but I assume the drop is going to be pretty big, which means a future needs a safe TP if you’re gonna do one"
1616028916,"Like Jeremy said, it’s better to get out before the peak then get out after the peak, better safe than sorry"
1616028942,no even that massive drop yesterday was after dropping from 1.9B vol on the last big jump a few days before
1616029025,Could we see a dump taking us below $1 in that case?
1616029035,A drop to 54 bounces back to 59
1616029052,I'd say that's close to impossible
1616029076,"at this moment even going below 1,10 seems unlikely"
1616029077,Well that’s music to my ears then :p
1616029083,Do you think btc will drop again tonight ? Or will beat his best
1616029089,"if 1$ is your liq, you'll be fine"
1616029101,My liq was 1.11 earlier and thought that was fairly safe
1616029109,it probably is
1616029137,You are safe
1616029170,ENJ is doing so well that we're talking about ADA now
1616029194,`draco after tp
1616029194,If ada can fully realise their smart contracts before eth 2.0 shit will fly.
1616029195,"I was on a 5x leverage, think I’m going to do that again and renter with a TP of 1.5 - but that entry point is something I need to figure out 🤔"
1616029236,Right now I'm considering to remain ada-less until the potential drop after 4pm
1616029258,Even spot? 😮
1616029259,and then I'll stock up to get ready for release on regular coinbase
1616029267,should i sell my ada at around 3 pm?
1616029267,I don't do spot trading anymore
1616029276,If ada crashes down to 1.10 im cashing out and going yolo x 50 with margin to 0.9 on ada
1616029278,probably not
1616029297,Oh @bcdcdaz is back! My ENJ must be worth $6 now
1616029320,"the largest spike will be after ada is released on regular coinbase, which will be tomorrow evening"
1616029327,you seriousley missed out on the news
1616029330,but at what time? 😦
1616029337,No coinbase pro is tomorrow
1616029338,I guess? What’s the news
1616029359,"At 4pm, and usually the release on regular coinbase is within hours after that"
1616029359,"Oh fair enough, I’m going to keep my 60ADA in that case and use this money I profited from the original ADA pump to maybe do what you’re doing and renter on a future ready for the regular coinbase listing. Only issue is, I don’t think we know the time between when it’s listed on coinbase pro to when it’s listed on coinbase regular, which could be hours or days 😦"
1616029360,Oh was that a joke
1616029365,property deal with enjin announced on video
1616029377,I doubt they will go normal coinbase on the same day
1616029386,I'm pretty sure it will be hours
1616029395,"I guess a lot of people missed out on the ENJ news, doesn’t seem to be doing much."
1616029412,I mean it’s ADA so I can’t see why not (assuming the requirements are met regarding liquidation)
1616029439,last week they listed 3 coins and all of them went public on regular coinbase 3 hours after trading started on coinbase pro
1616029481,Good night lads
1616029498,Good night 🙂
1616029525,"I really like your strat, it seems most profitable if done right, but calling the dip’s lowest will be tricky"
1616029539,Look how big her 4 hr candles get
1616029542,
1616029555,She hasn't even woke up
1616029576,That was following a massive dip though
1616029584,"we're up for an interesting evening, that's for sure. 😄"
1616029592,"Well not massive, but a noticeable dip nonetheless"
1616029603,correction in 1 day
1616029605,BTC IS DOWN 5K WTF
1616029615,"I was assuming this was very recent news, was looking at the 30m and 1h candles"
1616029627,:kekw:
1616029661,15 hours until it launches it says on coinbaseblogger
1616029679,"It’s a bit annoying that I’m having to go back home tomorrow to see my sister for her birthday, we’re doing a joint birthday thing - I don’t think I’ll be able to stay off binance, I’m a little addicted :kekw:"
1616029711,Who cares about family if you have crypto?
1616029716,"Man why did you do this, almost gave me a heart attack 😂"
1616029739,As long as your sister isn't an NFT ofc

1616030121,"So if I wanted to put my 60 ADA into a 7 day stake, I’d get 1.45% of ADA per 7 days? This is huge for spot trading, right?"
1616030131,Shoulda bought eth
1616030151,YEAHH

1616030715,Its not a different name
1616030716,:((((
1616030716,is like bitcoin and bitcoin cash
1616030725,Its just a ticker
1616030739,What the fuck
1616030748,cardano is too long for a exchange
1616030774,man i can't believe everytime there is a good time to sell enj im either asleep or doing something productive
1616030871,I have a question for you guys about the BNB vault on Binance:
1616030886,long doge
1616030897,enj back to 2.50
1616030904,10cents
1616030904,"I bought 9 BNB and had it automatically put in the vault, and the amount showing is 8.87 BNB"
1616030929,What happened to my .13 BNB?
1616030936,x50
1616030940,Has anyone had this happen or know what it could be?
1616031024,"Cardano was a historic figure, and his wife or girlfriend or something was named Ada"
1616031038,50% tp at.08
1616031121,Cardano was an important Renaissance mathematician from Italy
1616031198,
1616031212,
1616031220,There we go if stuff happens tonight
1616031265,I doubt it will hit tonight or go above and 2 dollars should be a good moment to correct back down
1616031293,
1616031307,Aka short ada from 2 dollar 10X. Maybe make double the money on the short and then do big boy x30 or x50 long on ada
1616031334,cryptowat.ch even shows you how high the bounce is
1616031339,:dababy: make like 5 k on ada movement alone
1616031367,you hover over the price and it changes on the chart
1616031389,super useful for futures
1616031400,And then with all the profit. I buy more ADA for storage and make sure i keep enough for casper
1616031444,The original cash will go back into the long. Rinse and repeat
1616031593,
1616031680,"Ada comes from Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician."
1616031698,But yes it is weird that they didn't pick one or the other
1616031713,Just call it Cardano  CAR
1616031879,"Might be late to the news, but we figure out KNC is pumping?"
1616031906,*Why KNC is pumping?
1616032243,no way this works
1616032254,ada is not even gonna reach $2 anytime soon to begin this lol
1616032289,at what price did u enter with that long that sells at $2?
1616034167,yeah my TP is 1.61
1616034172,no way its gonna hit 2
1616034495,Not how it works lol. I get 5-10 ADA each 5 days depending on the percentage my operating pool gives me. I own over 10k coins that are staked.
1616034515,Or are you talking about some other staking system
1616037766,yea staking is so shitty
1616038048,"Can anyone help with Theta staking, mines broke"
1616038052,Qhat exchange yall use for flipping ada ?

1616039056,"actually it works extremely well, Im a programmer so i want to start programming my own sort of Indicator, just to spare time while i am in trades. 
I was hoping for some other indicators i could use to actually help in the community etc"
1616039096,"but not shit ones, we all know ema, bands, rsi etc. I just mean those hidden gems that have actually proven to be super usefull"
1616039102,useful *

1616039314,"I haven't yet, i will now though. I appreciate it"

1616039583,"I believe that's what it is, yeah"
1616039598,it's really unique which I like a lot
1616039678,"yeah i really like the pressure circles too, it gives a good indication on the trend line in the immediate term which would be great for scalping"
1616039755,"for sure, those have been on point for me for quite a few times whenever I'd do quick trades"
1616039795,trying to wrap my head around the back lines atm
1616039864,have you checked the settings?

1616041579,you?
1616041780,"Since 2017 i started, will admit wreckage in the bear market but learning to trade in a bear market is like going to war with a blind fold"

1616050729,At what time is ada getting listed on coinbase?
1616050732,I can’t remember
1616050749,3am eastern standard time for Australia
1616050751,I think the conference is at 11am UK time
1616050755,In about 9 hours
1616050776,Ok thanks
1616050806,That’s if I read it properly. They said 9am PT time which I assume is pacific
1616050822,Yeah
1616050826,I remember now
1616050834,It was 9am PT
1616050852,I’ll be sound asleep when it occurs.
1616050863,I’ll be looking
1616050874,Don’t expect an immediate impact
1616050897,I think there will be an impact in the 3-4hrs after it starts though
1616050917,Yeah same
1616050932,"Not fussed anyway, not trying to future or trade the movements"
1616050934,Ada isn’t still on coin base ?
1616050953,It’s going on coinbase Pro in 9 hours
1616051180,And how long till regular coinbase?
1616052090,
1616052093,Good morning
1616052184,"i hate to break it to you but the impact isnt gonna happen when it hits, it already happened/is happening once people found out about it going down/happening. the only thing that will massively impact its price is if some amazing new news is announced that no one could have predicted/known about"
1616052282,The latest cb listings did well a few hours after the release
1616052291,Even tho ada is way bigger
1616052302,Also
1616052307,the fatter the market cap the smaller the move
1616052319,If something big comes out of the conference
1616052333,
1616052350,It could definitely go higher and create more fomo
1616052418,Got that chart from this guys article it's pretty amazing. Little outdated cause it's in January and crypto has caught more buzz
1616052499,From announcement to listing means up until the moment before it actually went live?
1616052540,I always wanted to buy chr and after your call i did it.. hope it goes to 1$
1616052569,Correct
1616052574,just be prepared for it to fluctuate a bit as it finds its feet
1616052585,The coin s that do the best on listing are the ones with no announcement
1616052625,Well that’s pretty obvious
1616052654,i read somewhere that ada goes fully decentralised on the 31th that surely would pump the value up more than 25%
1616052670,31st
1616052674,ty
1616052678,Historical data is good it's something to go on but one thing different is ada has been around and stable and  not just some random shit coin listing. ADA managed to be #3-4 crypto without coinbase support is impressive.
1616052702,I really hope the conference drives its price up
1616052719,Pump KAI
1616052734,"so what im hearing is, keep my stop loss tight and remove my take profit"
1616052759,That’s not a problem if once it does find his feet it goes up to a new ath
1616052779,its up 12% in 15 mins
1616052782,"idk man, im a technical analysis freak i dont do much with this fundamental analysis stuff except for the surface level things that drive human behaviour"
1616052794,I tried to do relative math and I think 1.60 is safe spot to get out
1616052828,would you say that generic support resistance TA is reliable?
1616052863,Hi 🙋‍♂️. Is it still good time to enter CHr u think. ?
1616052864,only when couched within a wider strategy which confirms your general trend on the bigger charts
1616052899,"yeah that call is good until it pops off majorly, which could take hours or a day or two, its kind of hard to predict."
1616052919,Well price is not too bad at the moment
1616052925,Probably will double
1616052933,It would go up 100% to reach its previous ath
1616052936,@Sausage Destroyer in retrospective how many times were you wrong/right about your trades in general?
1616052958,"for the ones i give out here, i have yet to be wrong but honestly please please DYOR"
1616052970,I lost some usdt on KSL shit.  Any thogh on it. Will it grow ?:)) or better sale and buy CHR 🙂
1616052975,I like it cause the market cap is pretty small.. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it at 2$
1616052985,Obviously not in a week time
1616053041,"@Sausage Destroyer I am doing my research by asking you about general stuff, because I can see you have more experience than me regarding trading stuff"
1616053051,all it takes is one or two whales for everything to pop off so you never know with low cap coins
1616053051,i guess you are a swing trader right?
1616053066,swing and day yes
1616053092,Hey guys
1616053094,Any thoughts on PRQ coin ?
1616053098,Still awake
1616053107,Helio fake Andrei. Lol
1616053109,Guess Europeans
1616053131,"i dont have opinions on coins, to me they are all just coins, like i said, im a technical analyst not fundamental, other postgrads here are good for fundamental"
1616053134,Hell yeah..thank you
1616053158,Now I have to get back to bed
1616053182,Night night 🙂 u laid ur bed. U sleep in it 🤪
1616053313,"this is all hypothetical ok? so what if I buy a coin that has a value of 0.0001 btc and I ask my fren to buy it in order inflate the value, he buys it for 10k usdt value, would I be able to inflate its value just with me and my fren? like a less organised pump"
1616053338,consider that the low value coin has a small market cap too
1616053373,"no, not at all thats not how the arbitrage AI works. you need major volume and orders on the order book to cause a noticeable shift"
1616053439,each order and sell/buy and its amount is weighted in total with what is coming/going at that point in time which then sets the price in that moment....
1616053470,ty for illuminating me sensei
1616053474,np
1616053489,i thought for a sec that I managed to find a loophole in the system :((
1616053507,if it was that easy it wouldnt exist because it would be too broken.
1616053653,
1616053659,Good moanin all
1616053760,well done.
1616053767,its still going too btw
1616053781,she gon moon and the enj hypers will spam chat again
1616053793,i hate that coin with a passion now
1616053800,even though i been in since 2.50
1616053802,"@Sausage Destroyer chr is still going down, what could be a possible good entry level?"
1616053819,yeah i said it will need a bit of time to settle properly
1616053828,Right
1616053844,"also BTC is pooping right now, which affects most coins"
1616053992,I’m throwing 500$ every time it goes down by 2c
1616054069,i updated my call to explain my words a bit better.
1616054175,yo @Sausage Destroyer what indicators did you use to make your CHR call? Is it just that its gone down a lot and is unlikely to go down further? (below 0.35)
1616054199,"lol ""paper hands chump"" :kekw:"
1616054254,
1616054347,"that's only a small part of it, bigger 'clues' are the completion of sell volume and the 10% rise over the last day and the low volatility, as well as traditional indicators and tools like Fib retrace on the daily, MACD etc"
1616054352,
1616054353,What u gona do with all that BtC u hiven a way.  Stop it dazz!! 🥳
1616054419,Is this for the tattoos??
1616054454,Hahaha
1616054470,Just leave it there
1616054472,"im off for the night, bed time - laters"
1616054483,"Yo cheers for the explanation, g'night"
1616054500,@Sausage Destroyer why is enj so high out of the sudden
1616054514,there was no announcement
1616054515,Do you TA kanye you'll see
1616054527,its just how it be sometimes when it be like that
1616054549,"Maybe the new exchange an coin pairs, dyor"
1616054554,fa and ta
1616054590,Anybody has the schedule for the africa conference?
1616054624,Cardano is at 11 Uk time but I want to know how long it’s gonna last
1616054643,I’ll probably be eating while that happens
1616054734,Welp enj is going back to 2.5 anyways
1616054779,Based on this we should short ada once it goes live
1616054817,huh I showed you the pattern last night. was on the verge of going up then
1616054887,but there is not going to $3
1616054896,"the sell walls at 2.80, 2.90, 3.00 and everything in between are enormous, may take some time before $3 again"
1616054903,"Is literally falling down again, like a quick pump"
1616054908,it would require a massive whale to plow through all of those
1616054991,"if btc didn't interrupt its run today, I think we would have been really close or maybe right at $3"
1616054997,"Bud, listen. You know that ball hanging thing at the back of your throat, thats called a Tonsil. Its not a testicle. Stop being a dick."
1616055008,"but as usual, btc loves to shit itself when enj is having a bullrun, doesn't surprise me anymore"
1616055020,ohh i get it now
1616055050,"resistance was at 2.80, which has the smallest sell wall out of 2.90 and 3.00"
1616055061,"maybe some other time, who knows"
1616055073,it just takes one big ass whale to eat it all up and we're back to $3
1616055161,"it wasn't just a quick pump, the run up was building up for 4, almost 5 hours."
1616055187,"I was awake throughout all of it and it looked organic, plus just look at the graph"
1616055189,But now according to the logic of the graph is gonna go pretty down right?
1616055194,Like when it touched $3
1616055204,"it will find its new support, hopefully higher than last time"
1616055207,And the new big red candle
1616055214,maybe around 2.60-2.70?
1616055220,that would be a good one
1616055229,"considering that today, it wasn't dropping below 2.50"
1616055229,"support at 2.65, then accumulation then back up"
1616055244,it's taking smaller steps before it gets comfortable at $3
1616055246,"and thats my last call, off i go."
1616055249,this kind of growth really needs time
1616055253,agreed
1616055256,nighty night
1616055503,morning ADAmantoises!
1616055597,"it might accumulate at around 2.68, which would be the next fib level"
1616055620,"if it breaks it, then 2.65, per Crypto-Domme's suggestion"
1616055738,How many hours til ADA is listed on coinbasepro?
1616055854,i say it can go down till 2.60
1616055856,and around
1616055862,five cents up or down
1616055912,"yeah that's the fib level below 2.65, likely"
1616056194,Stmx looks like nice dip to buy.
1616056409,Yeah is touching it
1616056587,That an ff ref?
1616056662,btw i might be doing a list of coins deserving a mid investment in case we have another altmonth in april-may
1616056682,if somebody wants to join the research 😅
1616057114,yes it is!
1616057370,Yo
1616057384,Thoughts on Lina going out on 3 hours in Binance?
1616057400,"same as Alice, buy at the first hour sell in the next one?"
1616057480,damn I did a cross instead of a isolated lol
1616057484,balls deep now 😂
1616057554,yeah
1616057560,it wont be same as alice
1616057574,Im afraid can’t be much help. But would love to see the list lol though I’ve been looking in to PRQ coin lately a lot. 😎 thinking to buy some.
1616057580,you will need to be quicker here
1616057616,i will
1616057840,miner exchange inflow just hit a one month low
1616057856,🚀
1616058564,😂😂😂😂
1616058737,I just joined @Sausage Destroyer's CHR call at 0.385. 🚀 🌛
1616058770,Guy any advice.. UNIswap or Poloniex? i want to buy some PRQ and binance doesnt sale it.
1616058778,Wait what
1616058782,so need to register on new plance.
1616058783,New listing?
1616058799,Also does anybody know shit about COTI?
1616058826,It has several stuff happening in the next 3 months
1616058858,"Bitcoin sell signal on 15m and 30m chart 3 hours ago, expecting it on the 1h soon"
1616058869,"Does anyone know the best way to set up my BOLL, RSI, MACD etc charts? Trying to do some day trades"
1616058922,"What do you mean ""set up""? You tick the checkbox that makes them display on the chart"
1616058938,Changing the amounts etc
1616058986,"You mean you don't want MACD(12, 26, 9) but different values?"
1616059007,
1616059015,Click the little cog wheel for settings
1616059035,Was looking into a BOLL and RSI combo that will allow me to read the que points better
1616059065,I Know how to change. It’s more what to changes the values to
1616059077,oooh okay. Now i get it
1616059092,Back in Black
1616059101,What a lovely day
1616059106,"On RSI I understand. Like lines at 25 and 75 to know when oversold and overbought territory is, right?"
1616059137,"What do you need on BB tho? I mean, to check if the candle is close to one of the Bolli bands you just look"
1616059166,You should not. The defaults on Binance are good values. Why would you change them if you don't know what to?
1616059224,"On the contrary, that's what most people probably look at. The value of these indicators lies partly in the fact that a lot of traders rely on them and will do exactly what you expect them to do when certain points are crossed. Sometimes exactly the opposite to screw you out of your position. 😉"
1616059258,"But it's not like there's a magical setting like ""oh set the period to 13.5 and the upper bolli band multiplier to PI and then your TA will be error-free"""
1616059268,why binance doesnt let me trade innovative tokens?
1616059294,Because other values can turn down the risk factor and lots of traders have a different value they like to trade at. Was just looking into what everyone sort of trades with
1616059311,thats goes with crypto in general
1616059326,Of course
1616059327,so I can margin trade but not spot trade with innovative tokens?
1616059337,thats bullshit of the highest degree
1616059367,enj nicely consolidating between two fib levels
1616059381,I like to use the defaults. But I usually look at short timeframes. Works for me.
1616059382,"I mean, it wouldn't hurt to chuck a few quid on it surely"
1616059414,Please show the whole chart so we can verify where you anchored the fib. Otherwise you could just made the fib to match your hypothesis.
1616059422,also include timeframe tyvm
1616059446,"I don't know, what does it say when you want to buy LIT? I can spot and margin buy LIT."
1616059510,"do you mean Innovation Zone, like LINA?"
1616059514,yep
1616059516,
1616059528,i know its not tradable yet
1616059529,but
1616059539,"because
> The subscription period will start shortly at 2021-03-18 5:00 AM (UTC) and will be open for 4 hours."
1616059550,that was 25 minutes ago 😢
1616059553,I missed it as well
1616059600,that's on tradingview
1616059609,you can also open it from within binance
1616059621,Dont u have to pay for trading view?!
1616059631,
1616059644,👍🏿
1616059653,there's a free basic pack which is free
1616059666,Oh okay
1616059672,Thanks for that
1616059685,"so I wanted to ride the latest innvative token listed on binance which was bifi, so I bought some bnb to try the ride the initial hype wave but it didnt let me"
1616059692,"The wrong LINA is up even more 😄
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lina/"
1616059767,"I don't know, I've never used subscription"
1616059865,IM DOING long xlm
1616059867,im doing good?
1616059914,!warn @Kayne rule 6 violation
1616059914,
1616059923,Lol
1616059956,:kekw:
1616059978,"That being taken care of, I saw SXP on CT a couple of times. I even bought some SXPUP a while back."
1616059992,don't have any right now though
1616060019,"If you wanna be Post Grad, give us a good entry price from here. I'm not going in at $3.33"
1616060047,Homework not done. RSI is way too high
1616060091,"Next update from Kayne will probably be ""fuck, my SXP future is down -200%"""
1616060119,lmaoo
1616060168,"Wait, what?! Are you joking?!?!?!? Before I was looking at SXPUP which got me confused, because it's at $2. But you seriously make a call that it will go up 2 cents??"
1616060356,bruh wtf is goin on with ada
1616060396,I think you just disqualified yourself for life for that rank
1616060449,Trading starts on Coinbase Pro in six hours
1616060468,All in on VET rn
1616060510,i aint complaining
1616060519,lmao neither am I
1616060527,last 2 days have been crazy good
1616060535,Today is gonna be insane
1616060535,uh huh ... easy 5%
1616060569,Then why not call at $2.26 when you enter yourself? Now **that** would be a Post Grad move
1616060574,Got into lina 2 second before it closed 🤣
1616060588,LINA to go top 50 after launch
1616060601,I thought it had a smaller market cap
1616060611,But it’s actually not that small
1616060626,It always is in a bull run
1616060639,the real skill is making money (or at least not losing too much) in sideways and zig zag markets
1616060677,Yes because I didn't fathom you would tell people to jump on a .6% increase and I was looking at SXPUP
1616060947,"Yeah, that chart screams ""Hold but don't buy rn"""
1616060977,"I hope so, I'm jumping on it first thing"
1616060995,All green even enj is doing better. If it stay abovr 2.6 for a few days im chilling my margin
1616061034,I’m also jumping in.. i made 40% with Alice
1616061294,Yes
1616061337,Breaking through 1.45 gives me the fuzzies
1616061470,There goes enj bleeding again
1616061547,"anybody up to advice a crypto newbie which wallet to choose? Speed and anonymity are probably the most important aspects for me, aside of obvious stuff like low fees, mobile app etc."
1616061567,binance
1616061582,@Lipton you could get a nano ledger
1616061592,It is
1616061596,if you arent looking to trade and just want coin
1616061640,ngl getting a ledger wallet at this stage feels like an overkill to me lmao
1616061649,I mean not really
1616061650,"and besides, i probably will start trading"
1616061657,yeah then just go binance tbh
1616061661,aslong as you arent in the US
1616061666,if you are in the US then coinbase pro
1616061703,"sure, some day ... if this bull runs lasts another couple of weeks probably also this cycle."
1616061705,Well you don’t want to do that
1616061712,"what about electrum? I was reading about it and it feels ""ok"""
1616061724,Well you cannot do that 😄
1616061733,Thank god
1616061746,why shouldn't people from US use binance?
1616061764,also good question ^
1616061767,I've heard something about them closing accounts
1616061776,but I'm not really sure whats the issue
1616061786,It doesn’t have many coins listed
1616061795,I think that’s what it is
1616061795,"Oh fuck, you can ... 😮 
https://ftx.com/trade/LINA-PERP"
1616061822,I’m european
1616061828,So I don’t really care
1616061837,"The issue is, everyone is afraid of the SEC. So they segregate the US customers away from the regular frenzy and only offer a limited selection of assets from the to trade on Binance.us"
1616061882,binance us is way different than normal binance
1616061899,so that's why
1616061908,thanks for a clear answer
1616062100,is there any way to go around eth fees rn?
1616062124,I wanted to transfer my funds to a diff eth wallet from binance but the fees are stupidly high
1616062132,how long til ada goes live?
1616062143,what's the secret?
1616062209,"Exchange for LTC, move those, change back to ETH 😄"
1616062241,"Dude, what's your grief with post grads? Did you lose money on some call or something?"
1616062267,Six hours
1616062277,thanks
1616062286,uh huh. It's merit based tho...
1616062309,you dont postgrad by hiding info
1616062317,you get it by lots of good info
1616062340,"So what is likely to happen when it goes live on Coinbase Pro ... rise and then people dump? ugh, this will be like bidding for festival tickets *newbie*"
1616062341,also you can buy LINA/USDT on bitmart
1616062342,my problem is that I want to transfer funds from binance to metamask so I have to do it over eth network
1616062357,im sure theres other places
1616062357,usually I do XLM between exchanges
1616062430,"also, a question, for a friend"
1616062454,is it worth to go through of trouble of getting a binance.com account as a us resident ?
1616062463,or not worth the hassle
1616062478,Maaan
1616062484,I never got to buy into Ada
1616062503,That bs coin never dropped to 1.34
1616062515,Sorry dude
1616062515,if binance.com realizes you are from us your account gets auto purged
1616062528,"legally, us residents are supposed to use the binance.us exchange"
1616062532,you can fudge
1616062538,but .us has less coins
1616062565,i want to know if i should convince my friend to go through the secure email / vpn route to make a .com account
1616062622,he won't be able to buy with fiat on .com
1616062637,Yo @raven 🥚
1616062639,because he will need to comply with aml/kyc before he will be able to use fiat
1616062646,What’s your prediction for the lina peak
1616062659,how the fuck am i meant to know
1616062660,Would it pass 1$?
1616062671,I just wanted your opinion bro
1616062688,you can make purchases on .com without passing kyc
1616062707,with crypto not fiat
1616062726,unless I don't know something
1616062732,i know this because i did it. i only did kyc so io could participate in launchpad stuff
1616062740,you can buy btc directly
1616062744,which is what i did
1616062746,and stil do
1616062753,and then use btc as ur pair
1616062774,I guess your account has to be outside of uk and eu
1616062786,"its actually better for me to do that, because as an aussie if i directly deposit aud i lose access to a couple of coins"
1616062796,and i can buy btc with 0 fees coz of poli
1616062808,deposit just takes up to 24 hrs
1616062838,ok
1616062839,In that case I guess your friend would be able to use the account normally
1616062857,LINA is currently trading on bitmart at under 0.02
1616062864,$1 is not reasonable imo
1616062885,"i think a peak of 20c is what it could get to, but unless you have a bot based in japan, dont bother with it"
1616062891,it could get higher
1616062908,"even $1 of theres a heap of activity, but i dont think itl do an ALICE"
1616062973,@Joshx
1616063007,i think 1c is where itl end up
1616063028,25% higher than it was before the spike after announcement
1616063160,Wrong LINA
1616063168,wrong lina ?
1616063170,It’s at 26c
1616063172,Yeah
1616063194,It’s not the one getting listed
1616063215,There are two LINAs. Linear and Lina
1616063233,"Also, the one on FTX has a third, different logo 😄"
1616063236,don't know which one that is
1616063240,im looking at linear (lina)
1616063255,can there be 2 coins with LINA ticker ?
1616063266,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lina/
1616063274,3.5c
1616063307,Wrong one
1616063314,It has 3 lines as logo
1616063332,3 parallel lines
1616063346,interesting
1616063381,so there are 2 LINA tickers
1616063381,the one launching on Binance is https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/linear/
1616063383,weird
1616063387,yup
1616063388,yea
1616063390,i can see that now
1616063396,huh i didnt think that was possible
1616063397,til
1616063452,then yea
1616063455,$1 is possible
1616063504,I think the peak will be higher
1616063520,The point is
1616063528,How do i get in?
1616063558,When there are new listing i usually wait
1616063564,And jump in later
1616063574,Like i did with alice
1616063637,he starts with
1616063641,"""I think"""
1616063681,Depends on the timeframe you're looking at. Next 10 years? Possible
1616063689,but that's a 50x from here so I wouldn't bet on it
1616063694,Certainly not with futures 😄
1616063736,do i have to pay additional money to binance in order to be able to trade innovative tokens? @SeineJanie thats what you meant by subscription?
1616063771,"No, it could also go down a lot because people bought it on other exchanges in hopes of dumping it on listing day to buyers on Binance"
1616063779,where?
1616063787,"yep, it can dump immediatel;y"
1616063796,like literally second 1
1616063845,price prediction i would say 0.8 max
1616063862,"Well, good for you if you have a Huobi, FTX, Coinone or Bithumb account. I don't."
1616063885,"Any opinions on gamerhash? I know how it sounds, but apparently i just made my first 1$ by using it lmao"
1616063944,"I was just curious which of these exchanges you used to buy it in advance. I'm not opening yet another account, I'm waiting for the Binance listing and looking at the first minutes to decide where I enter."
1616064173,Thx raven
1616064207,It took me like half an hour to buy on unicornswap and deposit to binance all kinda shit
1616064219,ignore what i sadi
1616064220,i was on the wrong page
1616064221,Im planning to list a selling order at 5$
1616064221,there are 2 LINAs
1616064227,Yea yea saw that
1616064231,ok
1616064235,?
1616064239,LINA is not going to dump on release
1616064240,5$ is super high but i dont think its impossible
1616064251,It didn’t even go up that much as of rn
1616064273,It’ll easily surpass $1 on binance as soon as it’s listed
1616064288,1.5b usd was staked for lina soooo
1616064303,Some serious things will happen imo
1616064307,so did ALICE launch on binance first or was it elsewhere beforehand?
1616064316,Binance first
1616064338,Some people literally became multimillionaires btw
1616064340,So thats the difference we're looking at between that and LINA
1616064346,Yea exactly
1616064349,oh ...
1616064353,One is a 2018 released coin
1616064357,"I saw, 30k% damn"
1616064362,The other one was firstly launched
1616064366,Eth is such a shit coin atm :kekw:
1616064370,Alice did 600x
1616064378,Wasn’t Alice previously priced at 16$?
1616064381,no it didn't
1616064384,U surr
1616064385,Before launching
1616064387,i might chuck a small amoiunt in LINA then but I aint going overboard in case it drops
1616064393,I thought alice was already listend on kucoin
1616064396,that sounds much more reasonable
1616064397,Or something?!??
1616064410,"nope, Binance was first iirc"
1616064413,If I’m not mistaken it was 16$
1616064430,Ah i got 31 lina nice.
1616064437,"Ur telling me, someone that had 5,000 alice"
1616064442,Became a rich amn
1616064442,LINE 0.028 atm
1616064444,Man
1616064447,👀
1616064447,But binance showed 30k%
1616064461,It wasn’t listed as 16$
1616064461,LINA*
1616064468,Binance listed alice for $0.1
1616064474,"whats the more accurate, binance on web or app? cause I never get the same price even if refresh both"
1616064477,It immediately went up for $60
1616064486,"Well it wasn't on KuCoin at least, still isn't"
1616064487,I know
1616064488,After some waves it stabilized around $16
1616064496,Then it became it’s real price
1616064503,For coinmarketcap and other websites as well
1616064503,I sold it for like 45$
1616064513,When Luna gets launch?
1616064519,12pm UTC
1616064520,1h and 12mins
1616064536,Thank u
1616064536,Also ada conference in 12 i think
1616064550,We can’t put sell orders on binance for luna rn right?
1616064558,"Nobody listed it for that price, it was an order within the first minute candle, probably also to manipulate daily PnL"
1616064562,pretty easy to do
1616064564,Luna or lina?
1616064570,Lina* my@bad
1616064581,$10 is so high
1616064582,any order on LINA will be rejected until 12:00:00 UTC
1616064584,then you can trade
1616064587,"No, you can’t"
1616064597,You can do over bsc network
1616064602,"$1 is a guarantee win, $5 is probably the peak but i donno"
1616064609,"no, outlandish"
1616064619,what is a realistic price target on LINA here?
1616064624,5$ it goes top 20
1616064627,heard a new coin being listed can be messy as - might watch this one and takes notes - or add a low amount
1616064627,Around 1-2$
1616064636,Realistically
1616064638,Can the MATIC be good in the future ?
1616064644,Very optimistically $5
1616064649,Matic is a hodl
1616064650,Same for me
1616064664,from 700 mil market cap to 2.5billion market cap?
1616064665,I’m going to put an order at $5
1616064683,what do you guys think about ALGO?
1616064688,for linear? what
1616064692,@reqularhd it isn’t impossible man
1616064692,If lina gets to 1$ at launch ill shave my head
1616064694,Lol
1616064698,Shit isnt happening
1616064703,i can buy at 0.28 rn on bitmax
1616064707,"I'd also say, $1 today (3.6x) or maybe $2"
1616064707,Wish it does
1616064714,Just for that pic
1616064715,Lmao
1616064719,"$5 over the course of weeks, maybe"
1616064727,It is hard to exactly time the peak. Try to divide your sell orders just below key levels
1616064730,What is this lina project
1616064733,I’m going to buy if it drop more than 60% from the peak
1616064741,How is it reaching 1$
1616064745,Cause this is crazy
1616064750,What does this project do
1616064754,@RichySnipes rip your hair :kekw:
1616064759,The best pump ever
1616064759,Speculation
1616064766,@RichySnipes it moons
1616064767,That’s what it does
1616064778,what lvls should i set sells?
1616064784,could also dump back to $0.12 or something today 😄
1616064790,speculate to accumulate.. or something.. I just wanted to say that
1616064793,This
1616064798,I don't know enough about the project
1616064808,Just based on my experiences from Binance listing days
1616064810,How is some random coin hitting 1$ from 28 cents
1616064826,Cause first seconda everybody wants to buy in
1616064831,"Fuck it, worth 50 quid out curiosity lol"
1616064835,@RichySnipes that’s what tons of people said for many coins
1616064836,Because it's the next ENJ 😄
1616064838,Then it goes to shit
1616064846,see https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/linear/ 😉
1616064849,I don’t care about the project but it’s gonna be pumped regardless of the project
1616064851,That’s a fact
1616064880,Both ada and enj doing good
1616064914,I feel so bad to have sold my Ada at 1.11$ 😂
1616064929,I owe someone a beer on Enj - bought yesterday @2.28 - v happy today
1616064936,You'll feel sick later on 😉
1616064947,We cant sel limit unless trading starts

1616065004,Pancakeswap y’all
1616065010,When does it start ? Might throw some $ for 1 year
1616065021,i though ada would rise in price more today in the build up to the CB listing though
1616065025,Binance->trust->pancakeswap->trust->binance
1616065040,Casper option 1 release 23 march 2021
1616065060,Give it time
1616065077,Why there is a special hype for LINA ?
1616065083,Compare to other coin
1616065086,I don't understand
1616065097,Fuck Lina
1616065111,Go all in ada leverage x50 👍
1616065122,I don't mess with leverages
1616065126,Lmao
1616065128,Imagine a coin
1616065134,With so much hype around it
1616065144,People buy the wrong lina
1616065149,And it moons as well
1616065164,im to new to this for margin trading. Spot for me at the moment - need to learn a lot more
1616065165,hey alls well that ends well lol
1616065170,We’ve been talking lina last hour
1616065180,And people here say whats the project it wont see $1
1616065193,That’s where the hype is
1616065582,I don’t think there is a conference today
1616065594,5 hours
1616065600,4pm gmt
1616065615,lmma peoople buying wrong lina as well
1616065619,its 82%
1616065623,"March 18, 2021, 13:00pm GMT+2"
1616065655,Do you think it's good to SHORT ADA after the conf ?
1616065661,
1616065677,Yea
1616065685,I mean normaly it's the other way
1616065691,you buy because it's going to be listed
1616065696,and when it's listed it dumped
1616065697,no ?
1616065709,"u short at the cbpro peak, and then buy back at the dip"
1616065714,if it hits a peek of 2 dollar I would also tend to short it
1616065719,so
1616065720,No you sell at the peak or hodl for the long term or buy the dip again
1616065721,technically
1616065725,we are prepumping
1616065734,its like the xrp pump 😂
1616065739,"well, you, i havent buy"
1616065741,Mhm
1616065742,low futures multiplier short tho
1616065751,like 5x max
1616065752,"when the moment to pump was there, everybody dumped lol"
1616065753,i would say
1616065764,Could be pre-pumping the conference news for all we know
1616065825,remember the BNB conference ? lol
1616065830,1.50 in 30mins maybe
1616065850,have we got to ATH?

1616065953,"like, 3 minutes"
1616065960,"if you see it begin to dump at the end of the conference;, then you can short 🙂"

1616069770,"I don't think it will, tho. Probably going a bit up from here, setting up a bull trap, then continuing down"
1616069778,Lina got listed on binance already?
1616069843,Been 17 minutes
1616069911,It hit 1$ 👀

1616069982,i'd say 54k again
1616069986,if not less
1616069990,but might be wrong
1616070014,That’s grim / scary
1616070045,It just has to hold for 3 more hours
1616070053,My coins are still recovering from the last btc dump :p
1616070068,Then i’ll sell my ada and btc can do whatever it wants

1616070464,Her
1616070543,What's the expectations for Ada later then?
1616070635,so did any of you ride the lina wave?
1616070696,1.6$ max
1616070804,what lina wave ?
1616070810,it died instantly
1616070814,xD
1616070862,If btc can stay at 58k I think it can get as high as 1.70
1616070869,But it’s not looking good
1616070884,If btc dumps it’s probably gonna stay at 1.40

1616072529,So lina dumped
1616072533,Lmfao

1616072750,"about ADa, the announcement is already done ? At 4gmt PM there are going to open trading ADA on coinbase right ?"
1616072767,announcement was days ago
1616072804,i say we get to 1.73 and down to the grave
1616072911,Inc 50bn market cap on ada
1616073138,how long until the listing?
1616073163,SOMEONE TELL ME PLEASE 😍
1616073184,Just under 3 hours
1616073337,Is ADA the new ENJ yet
1616073411,2 45
1616073746,"Not yet, it will be when I lose money on it."
1616074283,So what is the play for ADA?
1616074292,I thought it‘s just coinbase pro?!
1616074305,dump like 20 seconds after it goes live on cb pro
1616074310,I bought in at around 1.02 and then more yesterday
1616074321,why dump when it goes live?
1616074331,buy the rumor
1616074335,sell the news
1616074370,bc theres always an pump leading up to listing
1616074377,and then it dumps when it goes live
1616074384,Isn't it supposed to rocket?
1616074411,now that needs to be made into a quote with warren buffet behind it
1616074419,some people who are new to this with FOMO will buy
1616074430,and the whales will dump on them
1616074433,its only pro listing
1616074441,oh ok
1616074444,there should be another rise after this finishes dumping
1616074447,wouldnt the dump happen on the regualr listing
1616074447,yea not sure what will happen then
1616074453,yea
1616074456,itl happen on bhoth
1616074499,"so sell when it goes live, buy the dip, sell when regular coinbase goes live"
1616074513,thats what im doing at least
1616074555,no guarentee of anything tho
1616074560,do you think the peek will be higher when the regular one goes live? or lower than pro's peek
1616074564,guys may i ask one thing
1616074575,if somebody calls you to invest some big bags
1616074585,im not sure about the peak
1616074586,how much % would you say its reasonable to get as cut
1616074595,from profits
1616074596,it could be anything from like where it is now
1616074608,20% of the profit
1616074610,to even like $3 if something insane happens
1616074630,i wouldnt try to time the top tho
1616074641,just pick a spot youd be happy to sell at
1616074644,and tp there
1616074661,"and if it keeps going higher, you can short it when it gets back to ur price"
1616074676,profit up and down and then back up then down again
1616074685,then get some actual ada and stake it
1616074716,You should ask them to go to a bank lol
1616074732,@raven 🥚 are you talking ada?
1616074738,ye well they come to me to invest in crypto
1616074738,yea
1616074744,Cause no way it goes to 3$
1616074751,WHY THEY WOULD GO TO THE PROBLEM ASKING FOR SOLUTIONS hahahaha
1616074752,"i dont actually set orders, im literally up in australia at midnight rn watching the 1 min charts"
1616074754,thats why i said if something insane happens
1616074758,do you want the stress to handle that money?
1616074764,i think $2 is unlikely even
1616074769,but oddities happen
1616074782,This
1616074782,"well, i recently started to manage the stress"
1616074784,I think ath is possible
1616074792,Trust me when smart contracts goes live and coins dump erc-20 for cardano it will poomp
1616074793,Set your TP where you believe
1616074797,Make that decision yourself
1616074804,trust my plan
1616074810,I got 50% at 2 dollar. 50 % at 2.1 :kekw:
1616074816,Yeah no doubt but I’m talking about today
1616074819,oh long term im still holding
1616074826,i have faith itl hit $5 one day
1616074831,i think its a great project
1616074835,Oh yeah same
1616074841,year and half from now
1616074844,mark my words
1616074859,i also have a ridiculous amount of faith in nano
1616074861,probably too much
1616074862,But I don’t think today we’ll see some insane rise
1616074863,the flow of money from people out of cryptos will be exponentially
1616074865,with time
1616074878,A new ath very possible
1616074880,I want to just casually wait until it crashes to 1.1 1.2 dollars. X 50 it. Pump margin in it until 0.9 and hodl and just watch the 10k% gains in the future
1616074886,or a normal distribution also
1616074887,ADA $10 within five years but the ride there is gonna be a rough one at times
1616074894,now you are delusional
1616074903,within 5 years
1616074904,idk
1616074908,that seems possible at least
1616074909,It’s possible
1616074911,oh
1616074912,5 years
1616074914,People used to call ethereum 10 dollars delusional
1616074915,well idk
1616074919,could happen
1616074920,It could happen but it’s also gonna correct massively
1616074927,Like 90%
1616074933,what is everyone's TP?
1616074935,i think if it hits 10
1616074938,🤓
1616074943,2018 ETH: am i a joke to you?
1616074946,its correctional value will be like
1616074947,im at 1.61
1616074948,8
1616074972,Eth ada flippening will happen
1616074984,Between now and 10 bucks ADA will fucking dip and dive and correct and people will cry
1616074986,Didn’t set one but i’d be happy with >1.5
1616075016,Anything above 1.05 is a profit. If it goed that low. I am going to party.
1616075026,mines at 1.9 atm
1616075148,Is the listing in 2 hrs?
1616075156,yea i think
1616075157,and 15mins
1616075161,Yup
1616075163,Ok great

1616075309,Time to watch The Ada show

1616075447,nobody on CHR?
1616075453,am I alone on this adventure?
1616075491,"That’s fair enough, it’s a big day for ADA, think im gonna grab some ADA after the dump (that there could be)"
1616075495,After the listing ofc
1616075507,I have stoploss at 1.4
1616075510,Plis dont rekt
1616075524,I' mwaiting for the right moment to enter
1616075536,I got in at 0.397
1616075542,Only on a 3x tho
1616075572,I got in at 0.24 sold at 0.51 after it fell from 0.74
1616075605,on 56% now for CHR
1616075613,wonder how greedy I can / need to be
1616075738,Ada cb in 2h?
1616075743,@kittiewitty I'm in
1616075759,"I don't really understand what people are expecting with ADA and the coinbase launch.  If you think it will dump, then why not sell now before that while the price is higher?"
1616075774,yes foto
1616075787,👍🏻
1616075797,GREED
1616075797,because we are trying to time the peak as close as possible
1616075803,what if it pumps
1616075809,And is there a possibility that it will pump?
1616075814,yep
1616075866,I have 1k in it
1616075895,
1616075900,"Did it just hit ath today, when it was at 1.47?"
1616075915,What are predictions on ADA? How high it could go in this pump
1616075920,No
1616075927,im aiming for 1.9
1616075928,on ada
1616075935,it probablyt wont hit that tho
1616075940,We can’t predict that
1616075947,but it could also hit higher if something dumb happens
1616075967,I’m gonna sell but i think this could fuel ada up
1616075968,@hollowviper always one step ahead of me lol
1616075982,I am in on 0.4 for *20
1616075986,your position is better :p
1616075992,Its funny it wasnt listed there earlier. Even Blox has it
1616076010,Like even if it doesn’t moon today it could still start a nice uptrend
1616076019,Ada didn’t move for 20 days
1616076116,I was in chr
1616076123,Sold cause I bought in too high at 0.47
1616076131,i say you all hol up
1616076139,cause btc will move soon i expect
1616076149,I'm tryna buy at 0.38 or below
1616076176,Paper hands @RichySnipes
1616076179,downwards I guess?
1616076180,Remember when you said this about ADA last night
1616076214,Lmfao I meant 0.40 not 0.47 💀
1616076230,Still paper hands
1616076239,Chr is not done yet mate
1616076249,I was in the red at 0.40
1616076251,before
1616076252,Didnt even start i think
1616076260,Yeah it hasnt started
1616076303,enji rn
1616076342,wtf is that volatility
1616076364,Gotta wait a couple more hours
1616076411,I am confident that the Japanese can at least get it to settle
1616077060,Btc doin shit
1616077065,As always
1616077077,When it matters you can be sure it goes down

1616077176,😂
1616077197,it was worth the 75x
1616077208,that guy with the liq point at 1.38 must be shitting it right now
1616077259,He should be fine
1616077279,it dropped to 1.395 lol
1616077287,that margin is not that big 😂
1616077386,ADA listing is XX GMT ?
1616077393,16 or 17 ?
1616077407,16
1616077618,1:30 min
1616077714,OMI 🚀
1616077719,What do you guys think about ATOM?
1616077803,SC/BTC is gonna 🚀 soon
1616077819,"ADA 1.5 easy for me, but maybe more"
1616077849,ENJ is literally the only red in my entire portfolio today.
1616077870,yup. under performing as always.  well the last almost 4 days
1616077878,Oh wait it’s green now because it dipped so low yesterday
1616077927,"THETA and TFUEL will probably pop soon too, for anyone interested"
1616077957,how long til listing
1616077957,I’m glad ATOM came up. Thought about selling off too many times while it was hovering at $18
1616077962,Holding theta since 2$
1616077971,GG
1616077973,1h28mins until the listing.
1616077976,Really happy with how it’s performing
1616077985,Biggest mistake i made is luna
1616077988,THETA has been phenomenal tbh
1616077996,Bought at 2$ sold at 6$
1616078003,It’s 18 know
1616078008,Fuck my life
1616078023,"well, if we all guessed the market, we'd be casually crashing lambos for breakfast"
1616078028,dont beat yourself there.
1616078042,well I could get behind that
1616078042,Yeah i still made 3x
1616078062,Not dump but down swing for a few hours
1616078066,no way
1616078082,"Wait a minute, two Boozles?!"
1616078099,I can’t make mistakes or jeremy is gonna get the tesla first
1616078109,my name's been Boozle among my friends for 5 years
1616078133,lmao
1616078169,dude that's amazing. I go by Bam McBoozle in my friends circle for roughly the same amount of time
1616078185,But who is the original Boozle???
1616078204,"that, my friend, is the ultimate question."
1616078211,I still got theta I bought at 7.2 IIRC
1616078215,150 bucks ATM
1616078221,i guess its a Boozle off!
1616078378,i think because of the fact my parents call me boozle... ima take the W on this one
1616078427,When was the MATIC SUSHI SKL listing on coinbase announced?
1616078433,The same day?
1616078444,My baby gets a mention 🙏🏻❤️
1616078490,Been in since 5.9 🙂
1616078618,Although I saw it at 1.9 but didn’t have the moneys at the time to invest 😦
1616078650,that my friend was a fact. i bought because you said that Lol
1616078722,huge difference in price here
1616078724,
1616078744,"0.023 on gate.io, 0.0193 on kucoin"
1616078753,same pair: VRA/USDT
1616078789,arbitrage opportunity right there
1616078844,that is amazing
1616078950,for ADA instead of when moon it should be when goguen
1616079023,not anymore
1616079145,yeah seems to have balanced out but was like that for a good few mins
1616079211,What's happening with BNB?
1616079297,good shit bro 👍
1616079373,
1616079510,Thanks
1616080083,What point is the listing on coinbase pro?
1616080105,"I really think that those two are about to breakthrough to the moon, but ofc, do your own TA"
1616080117,coins get listed on pro like 2 days before it goes live on the main website i think
1616080129,p2w
1616080134,super mainstream website. very easy for americans to buy
1616080136,Cause it looks like the peak was reached once it went live on the regular coinbase
1616080162,are you US ?
1616080164,So nobody is waiting for ada on the regular coinbase?
1616080172,then idk
1616080178,And they’ll get it in the pro versione
1616080179,everybody is waiting for coinbase
1616080193,Coinbase or coinbase pro?
1616080200,I don’t even know the difference
1616080203,literally everybody IRL that I knows that has coins bought it all from coinbase
1616080205,or litebit
1616080206,Coinbase Pro is today
1616080212,Coinbase Pleb is idk
1616080213,normies don't use coinbase pro
1616080217,too complicated
1616080227,I avoid coinbase now; Their fees are too damn high
1616080227,"they just type ""buy BTC"" and coinbase normie shows up"
1616080233,Ok so the difference is the interface
1616080241,Id rather buy off coinmama tbh as a USian
1616080243,for us. the educated folks. yes. but for normies they don't think about fees
1616080273,Crypto takes from the newbies and gives to the long HODLers
1616080287,mooooooon when
1616080289,Ada making a move
1616080291,How close are you to the tesla?
1616080293,up or down
1616080295,"So in 50min we will have coinbase pro pump 
And we will have to wait till regular coinbase?"
1616080300,Up
1616080306,Sike false alarm
1616080306,Not very. 5/30k
1616080318,I’m currently closer
1616080318,Thought ada was trying to hit 1.5
1616080321,"Still good for only being in 1,250"
1616080325,of my personal fiat
1616080344,but ya I wish I was further
1616080350,ada mooon
1616080355,I need to start playing safer tbh
1616080359,
1616080360,"jeremy do you think dumping just after release and then shorting is a good idea, then rebuying after it dips a few hrs later?"
1616080361,Adaaaaaa
1616080362,I don’t know what regular Coinbase will do to ADA
1616080366,See what happens today
1616080368,for the cb release
1616080382,Yeah I don’t know either
1616080385,nice entry
1616080399,im only up 50% on my futures
1616080403,if it starts dropping and dropping im selling waiting for around bottom. high leverage and mass margin and then just wait
1616080408,"I would guess that we get a dump right after the listing at 4pm. 2-3 hours later ada will launch on regular coinbase, giving us an ath"
1616080416,be a predator waiting for mainnet upgrades with my big leverage
1616080422,An immediate dump?
1616080427,probably
1616080434,but who knows how far
1616080438,So honestly I dont know what ADA is going to do. Its 100% going to dump. It may or may not pump because of cb release though and its too hard to tell how hard it will dump when it does. I personally am not going to hold any short positions in ADA but having a TP setup for a potential pump and then getting in at the dump would be good for a long term hold
1616080473,That would also be good for a short term hold awaiting the peak that comes with the listing at regular coinbase
1616080476,Can i set a stop loss even if i’m in profit?
1616080484,Yes
1616080485,I opened at 1.20
1616080498,i think your stops are just at USDT
1616080501,You can always setup a stop loss and you can even set it up for profit range stop loss 😄
1616080502,"im aiming just get to get some money, cover what i put in, and then any profit goes into real ada and staking it"
1616080506,so you can say stop at 1.3
1616080513,or 1.4
1616080523,That’s what i meant
1616080525,I got mine at 2 and 2.1 just incase
1616080531,Like stop loss at 1.4
1616080536,Take profits at 1.6
1616080539,so how long after cbpro release does it go live on cb
1616080548,
1616080555,depends on how quickly it gets the requires amount of money
1616080558,The only thing I hope that comes from this whole event is long term progression in ADA price. its been resident sleeper for too long and I hope the eventual dump doesn't take us back to square one
1616080560,Bro thanks
1616080561,forgot the term they use
1616080566,Man man I love it
1616080579,Same I think it could get it going
1616080583,i told people a week ago long ada. don't short it
1616080586,and here we are
1616080590,I have a SL at 1.4 and a TP at 5.0 so yeah
1616080591,chad prophet again
1616080597,lmao jokes it’s not 5
1616080600,little green finally
1616080604,But could you IMAGINE
1616080608,5 😂
1616080614,We’d be rich af
1616080615,i believe ada could go 5 in the future
1616080617,no questions abou tit
1616080624,"There is a world where we could be dumped so hard that its back to square one even though its unlikely; That would be the worse case scenario for ada tbh because with all this momentum, if it went back to where it was, I think it would just die due to people being too beaten down to get back on the ADA train"
1616080638,a smart contract chain with cheap fees a better method of developing than eth. why wouldnt it go up
1616080644,"10 in five years, 5 a lot sooner but wild ride in between"
1616080651,Thats why I hope we don't run into that scenario. Maybe correct around 1.20ish-1.30ish
1616080658,So how long is this ada run going for?
1616080660,That would be a good spot for ADA
1616080666,lol if it hit 5 id be %1400
1616080683,you think ada could just straight up die if it gets dumped too hard
1616080684,?
1616080693,Potentially
1616080698,I think if it went back to the 1.00ish range it would
1616080702,I think its unlikely
1616080706,that that will occur
1616080706,How many days has it been of it just slowly bleeding out
1616080742,ada got too much future stuff going on to die
1616080742,I held ada for over a week and it was just stagnate tbh. I wasn't aiming for a high TP or anything. It was SUPER slow before this
1616080747,unless ETH 2 happens NOW
1616080749,When it got to 1.0whatever the other day I legit thought that was it gone
1616080757,2 weeks for sure
1616080767,40 mins yea?
1616080773,Yeah
1616080786,Ada reaching ath
1616080788,Train’s leaving the station
1616080803,Where should i put a stop loss?
1616080810,inb4 it breaks through 2 and it doesn't stop
1616080811,"but ya, if this goes down to its previous, then I think its safe to say its probably not coming back BUT I personally don't think that will happen. Even though there is a chance it will, there is a much higher chance it corrects to 1.20-1.30ish range"
1616080812,That’s not for us to say dude
1616080813,put an OCO?
1616080814,and then its new low is 2
1616080856,If ADA hits $2 I will get an ADA tattoo
1616080862,It’s not that I don’t think it’ll happen but
1616080866,Dayum
1616080877,Honestly ADA has a cool logo ngl
1616080881,wouldnt be a bad tattoo
1616080884,enj has a shit logo
1616080886,lol just a N

1616080912,kek
1616080915,ada
1616080920,I dont see ada going under 1.2
1616080927,Honestly we need to stop looking at tech and charts and just buy from the logo alone from now on. We need to stop allowing these coins with shit logos succeed
1616080931,but fr
1616080936,ada is pretty cool

1616083936,More people go to shit
1616083941,I do think it will drop again the next weeks
1616083946,like the last time
1616083947,Will Ada go back up?
1616083950,no way I am going to sell ada at loss
1616083952,Back to square 1
1616083953,i rather kill myself
1616083960,"yeah suppose its not that much of a major drop, as its only at the point from yesterday 9pm GMT"
1616083964,Don't say that if you sell it goes up if you say its correcting you die
1616083977,Im not in Ada
1616083983,WHAT!?

1616083999,no hes a doge boy
1616084001,"either sell at small loss now, or sell at BIG lost later"
1616084026,some people will now wait till it goes uo
1616084033,and then after 2 days cut their losses
1616084041,Im break even again on ADA so I could sell but idk
1616084046,
1616084054,will ada correct?
1616084061,Yes
1616084066,So now you’re calling yourself out
1616084067,To bad im not in that chat
1616084068,Next coming weeks
1616084084,It’s a lot easier to shit on ADA again now that it’s not up $.40 lol
1616084087,stop twisting the knife dood
1616084104,by correcting you mean going up or down?
1616084104,How much you need for break even?
1616084115,i am too ashamed to tell
1616084121,I let ADA crash then brought on the rebound
1616084125,On its way back up now
1616084127,"Price fixing, back down"
1616084135,Nice
1616084145,Will take a little 10% and fuck it off
1616084149,Ada back to 1.24 1.30
1616084160,so I guess Ada is not going up to 2 bucks so imma sell in a minute
1616084176,there is still the regular coinbase listing?
1616084186,Really?
1616084194,2 days later I think I heard here
1616084223,It will probably list tonight
1616084241,1.4 hit and then dump again
1616084262,It could stonks
1616084268,Go with ur gut people

1616084420,is congo the best use case?
1616084434,a war torn country with a dictator
1616084448,wow biance pulled a robinhood
1616084465,"you cant withdrawl ADA, was gonna send it to coinbase trading for million more there"
1616084465,any thoughts on shorting btc?
1616084470,its peaking right now
1616084477,so like it feels like a good idea.
1616084508,this is bullshit
1616084527,@Joe[Need a financial advisor] how much more is it there
1616084545,wait what?
1616084548,125x it
1616084553,1.5
1616084563,Will ADA go back up?
1616084575,only when BTC hits $1mil
1616084577,oh shit
1616084582,its 1.51 there
1616084594,lul on regualr
1616084601,with the ADA it got liquidated so quickly that i've got a negative margin and i need to use more money to give money back to binance wtf
1616084623,it fixed that price now
1616084625,why no stop loss man
1616084645,because when i see it didnt pump it immedialtely click close market
1616084649,but it show me error
1616084655,couldn't even sell
1616084656,👏🏻There 👏🏻is 👏🏻no 👏🏻fuck👏🏻in 👏🏻125👏🏻x 👏🏻for 👏🏻alt👏🏻coins!
1616084656,yeah app is glitchy
1616084659,then lost all
1616084670,even more than all
1616084680,because I need to pay binance more money due to negative margin
1616084700,Gambling is fun aint it?
1616084704,
1616084707,he was going to do it on BTC
1616084756,"to be fair it looks way oversold right now, so its not a bad shout"
1616084786,"Oh sorry, I read only about ADA while skimming the chat 😄"
1616084789,All of you
1616084810,Im pretty sure we have a crypto event once a week like this 😂
1616084814,I should make the noose ENJ
1616084824,Bitcoin? Oversold? oO
1616084841,Tbh. Even i wouldnt of longed ada at 1.45
1616084855,Tbh if i was home a hour earlier i might of shorted it for lulzies
1616084865,Question about ADA: will it keep dropping?  Is it a good idea to sell now and buy it back in a bit when it's lower?
1616084872,I told everyone 1.50 would have been my TP; Even that didnt hit and I thought I was being conservatives
1616084882,
1616084886,why didnt I short it with a safe stop loss
1616084887,damn
1616084892,missed opportunity
1616084896,Why didnt you short it tho
1616084897,🧠
1616084900,I know. Im actually in the future
1616084917,cause I wasnt logged into binance and I decided to not join the ADA train on this one
1616084933,Im comfy until 1.05
1616084950,nice
1616084964,I havent done any trading the last 2 days
1616084970,just kinda watching and working on my IT certs
1616084973,Maybe now ENJ will P U M P because ada news is over
1616085000,it went 1.86 on cb?
1616085008,dump on binance
1616085012,to pump cb
1616085019,yes because its a different exchange AND CB is known to inflate their prices
1616085029,Holy fuck ADA why do you behave like ENJ
1616085030,exchanges don't have the same prices
1616085036,"i sold at 2444 sats, not the very top but still almost (11 minutes before dump)"
1616085051,the money i got from lina was lost here
1616085052,zzz
1616085067,they will have close prices but the only reason why its normally close to the same is because people buy from one and sell at another and vice versa
1616085079,they make profits on the price difference and honestly its probably done by bots now
1616085100,Thats why exchanges have similar prices but they dont HAVE to have the same prices
1616085151,"If I wanted to host an exchange that sold ETH for 1$, I have the right to do that just as much as any other trader has the right to buy from me and sell elsewhere"
1616085188,My prediction
1616085204,Ada will go back to 1.4. And slowly move down to its new main support
1616085232,"If it doesnt dump any harder, my prediction for support is 1.20-1.30"
1616085243,BUT it could dump harder
1616085265,I say 1.1 to 1.2 is probably its new main support
1616085281,honestly these next few hours will dictate how ADA does for the next week at least
1616085307,"if it gets too low, it will probably go back to where it was before this event: Stagnate/slow movements"
1616085336,"if it can hold it's liquor, then it could correct instead and have an upward trejectory"
1616085358,lets hope for that
1616085366,i need you to hug me and tell me that everything is going to be alright
1616085392,Even I can't tell if I would be lying or not quite yet by saying that 😂
1616085392,"1.36 entry price, i would gladly take 1.4 after this heart attack"
1616085416,@Jeremyfto I'm 95% certain that your TP will get hit once trading starts on regular coinbase
1616085434,That’s a good point. This is just Pro isn’t it
1616085447,Coinbase needs to start up ya know
1616085449,Yep
1616085460,usually the largest peak comes afterwards
1616085472,And when is that?
1616085481,And we’ve got two days until CB?
1616085482,we shall see! My TP was made for this pump alone. I dont have a prediction for the future of ada yet. I can tell you my updated prediction tomorrow when the dust settles
1616085487,its just too close to call
1616085487,the only question is what would be a good time to fill up one's bags
1616085496,most likely in 2-3 hours
1616085520,Oh CB is same day as Pro? I thought someone had said it’s a day or two after

1616085572,also RIP anyone who had a 1.17 liq or above
1616085585,That crazy dip is not what you like to see when holding a futures position
1616085586,Btc 60k
1616085624,will ada go up again?
1616085625,Well
1616085629,It didnt register for me. My SL was 1.24
1616085630,Not anymore
1616085640,mine was 0.9
1616085641,Maybe
1616085644,but i profited anyway
1616085664,oh cool! Good luck is on your side then
1616085670,Indeed
1616085674,might as well go grab a lottery ticket
1616085684,I almost fainted at that dip
1616085692,It was a hard as fuck dip
1616085704,i was about 4s too slow to short
1616085707,actually
1616085710,lookng at the chart is stroke inducing
1616085710,Ffs how do you think i felt when enj went from 4 bucks to 2.2
1616085712,bitcoin up or down?
1616085713,whatcha think
1616085716,coz the margin settings were wrong
1616085727,and by the time i had the order ready
1616085731,it was just too late
1616085740,and then i didnt think about the rebound
1616085744,if i had of done it perfectly
1616085756,i would have made about 10k%

1616085782,are you guys shorting ada?
1616085789,i calulated the gains i missed out on after
1616085796,and was :sadge:
1616085798,absolutely not
1616085808,wont it go down further?
1616085812,we have a huge gain coming soon
1616085814,I not shorting nor am I longing. I am popcorn watching 🍿
1616085823,same atm jeremy
1616085835,I think we've seen the most of this dip
1616085839,bought ada at 1.45 :<
1616085851,hi
1616085852,why?
1616085864,a lot of people thought coinbase would pump it
1616085865,thought it was gonna go ath
1616085866,After seeing this dipI want my ben and jerrys
1616085868,myself included
1616085873,yeah
1616085881,"well, if you still have it keep it either for hodling or for selling at 1,50+ later tonight"
1616085885,"tbh if you didnt get in at 1.30 or below, you should have not gotten in"
1616085896,i got out here
1616085910,yeah imma hodl until it goes high
1616085918,1.50 tonight? thats wishful thinking
1616085931,I had a stoploss but i put it for 1 ada
1616085975,"Too much ada yack, not enough enj buy"
1616085979,1.30 was the last safeish entry and even that isn't SUPER safe
1616085995,anything past that was a huge gamble
1616086000,i just hope ada doesnt become the next xrp
1616086006,Imma keep it till tonight
1616086014,If it isnt up by then imma sell
1616086034,"I just placed an order for 1000 ADA long at 1,34 and I'm not sure if even that will be reached"
1616086061,looks like the dip is over and it's going up in preparation of what's happening next
1616086077,".man, I always place my orders slightly too low 😦"
1616086079,OK so who broke the boson registration ?
1616086132,XRP went from 4$ usd to 0.34
1616086140,"got some for 1,35 now 🙂"
1616086147,its bouncing
1616086155,i bought xrp at 1 dollar
1616086162,and it's 0.4

1616086227,stick with ADA.. and even XPR i think will get back to what u bought it for
1616086277,"The more ada pumps, the more the depth chart stacks to the sell side.. careful"
1616086283,i just want to spoil my mom as she spoiled me when I was little
1616086296,i dont care about lambos and etc

1616086339,"LMAO
HAHAHAHHAHAHA"
1616086392,@Empress of Body Positivity I FEEL THAT
1616086398,XRP 1 dollar
1616086408,I bought at .4 early november then another bag at .8
1616086410,lost so much
1616086417,i bought it in 2018
1616086423,its a piece of shit
1616086423,rip
1616086425,I hate it
1616086427,garbage
1616086433,the tech is promising
1616086437,they have a lot of deals/partnerships
1616086457,I mean I hate what happened but its still a decent coin
1616086459,how come literally every coin since 2018 mooned except ripple
1616086465,fair point.
1616086495,Exactly because you dont understand blockchain and just follow hype and blablabla
1616086518,Sorry but got enough of stupid argument about xrp
1616086527,its okay
1616086534,XRP is one of the biggest private blockvhain
1616086539,Huge
1616086545,Created before bitcoin
1616086554,Already in use everywhere in the world
1616086558,In the banking sector
1616086573,Only that sec event broke the increase
1616086577,But be carefull
1616086586,Look all the market movement
1616086596,XRP doesnt care
1616086603,"the whole crypto business is all about having a decentralised market, which is why xrp is the most hated coin in general"
1616086610,It will go when his time is coming
1616086619,Xrp isnt afraid 😈
1616086620,??? Not at all
1616086624,@Empress of Body Positivity not really
1616086628,look at some other alts
1616086630,What are you saying
1616086631,not everything is defi
1616086643,Okay so I have a question: I just sold 3k worth of ADA at 1.35  (had bought at 1.06).  Should I buy back into ADA or would that be a dumb move?
1616086650,You have it because you just look at money. Its gonna be gr8. Swiss believes in it and if he does i do
1616086670,Im gonna buy some XRP just because of this conversation
1616086675,you could say that I am wrong and etc but the current price compared to other alts kinda speak for itself
1616086693,look I am going to be the happiest guy in the universe
1616086697,if i am wrong
1616086699,How do you define a timeframe

1616086746,In any case

1616086747,lol
1616086747,because of ada
1616086753,but wont sell
1616086758,"I think now might be a good time to go back in, but don't risk more than you're åreåared to løose"
1616086759,Not because of ada
1616086767,You bought into the top. You let fomo rule you
1616086771,Because of you and your knowledge of timeframe
1616086776,I know because i did with enj
1616086786,I full positiv with ada
1616086792,Cuz i bought at the low
1616086792,But i am hodling my position. Same with ADA.
1616086793,i started crypto in 2018
1616086799,My timeframe vision is not your
1616086801,Swiss started in 2000
1616086803,i was a hodler mainly
1616086803,Make FOMO your bitch not the other way around; Get those limit orders built out instead of market orders. Get those SL/TPs setup instead of just yoloing it
1616086805,I started before you
1616086810,i re entered market recently
1616086830,Im waitnf to buy some when it 0.30... I know there is life outside US lol  so SEC dosnt mean XRP will be dead. it will move on  🙂

1616087056,its a saying when someone feels personally insulted for petty reasons
1616087062,BETH or whatever their eth staking until 2.0 thing is called
1616087067,Ahhh not at all 😂
1616087084,Sorry im not english native so it could happen some misunderstanding
1616087095,dont worry
1616087099,i love you
1616087102,i love the swiss
1616087102,But about xrp
1616087110,It is more than a coin
1616087121,Just dyor
1616087127,Forget ripple
1616087134,Ripple is a company
1616087146,Check my post on the podium chanel
1616087163,And have a look on whats next with flare network and xrp
1616087180,will do
1616087193,Doge pumped several time cuz of a tweet does it mean that there is logics in this game
1616087218,The diff with xrp is that its the older one
1616087228,And used for crossboarder transaction
1616087236,Just imagine what they are building
1616087236,ADA back at my buy in price..... Sweeet
1616087250,I send you chf by my bank in switzerland
1616087255,They will use xrpl
1616087265,To convert at the lowest price
1616087276,And send it to euro dollars or whatever
1616087278,"I was interested in XRP because it was backed by banks, and it had fast transactions, which made me think that its going to have a great future"
1616087290,Future is coming
1616087294,for the time being it doesnt seem like that
1616087297,thats all
1616087297,I thought you said earlier that crypto was all about defi.
1616087299,Just take the big picture
1616087321,people were shitting on me for buying xrp
1616087323,big time
1616087325,Ripple is the first to be attacked by the SEC but when it is done
1616087350,They will be quiet when all others would have to deal with regulation
1616087354,XRP can be somewhat of a fan coin
1616087355,sometimes
1616087362,theres a bunch of moon cultists for it
1616087382,I agree and half of them dont understand the XRPL
1616087399,they just buy cause stonks
1616087444,Just take your time and compare whitpaper and code
1616087450,anyone in here long on enj?
1616087454,Ive seen people shilling
1616087457,might want to take a position
1616087459,You will see the bullshit of btc and how xrp is big
1616087499,Do you mean long leverage or long term bag
1616087514,long leverage
1616087535,might wait for a dip and buy in
1616087544,when is the ADA CoinBase listing for public?
1616087549,Be carefull’in fact
1616087551,Wait
1616087562,Within the next 2 hours I'd suspect (and hope)
1616087567,ENJ can dip hard and fast
1616087573,And has done so many times
1616087577,yeah im watching it dip right now
1616087578,Last week all coins went public 3 hours after trading opened on pro
1616087595,@Drahnreb have you managed to buy back in during the dip? It was quick so guess not? :c
1616087613,The ADA dip?
1616087619,Yeee
1616087619,I’ve bought back in
1616087631,gene simmons has the biggest smile on his face right now
1616087635,"the 4 coins I looked at that were listed in December, went public 5-7 horus after trading started on pro"
1616087681,"I should have kept my buy order at 1,23 open :kekw:  I bought back in now at 1,35, made some profit with that when it hit my SL and bought back in at 1,36"
1616087701,"Setting a SL at 1,37 and TP at 1,499 hopefully not robbing myuself"
1616087704,Nice one:p what leverage are you hanging in at?
1616087708,25x
1616087743,"isolated margin, liquidation at 1,31"
1616087753,"😮 that’s a nice leverage - I’m still in my CHR from this morning, ADA seems a bit scary right now to enter lol"
1616087772,"That liq might be a bit worrying though, if there is a drop:("
1616087789,"If this goes well I'll split the profit between getting into CHR hopefully for under 0,4 and padding the margin of my retarded child ENJ 😂"
1616087806,not with a sl above liq and above purchasing rate
1616087829,Hahah your ENJ child is a lost cause :kekw:
1616087855,"Yeah I think you’re sorted, let’s hope the coinbase listing is today 🙂"
1616087895,"woops, just had to re-open my ada position"
1616087935,💎 🙌 💎
1616087950,@Drahnreb  thx
1616087990,is coinbase losing ADA today? at 9pm ? what time zone
1616088105,So what's the consensus for ADA today?  Are we thinking that it will pump again?
1616088220,"I *think* it might (almost) reach 1,5 before midnight UTC"
1616088234,i say its going down
1616088238,but not below 1.25
1616088252,"yes, afterwards"
1616088263,"the 1.73 joke was fun and all that, don't think we getting that high this week"
1616088272,"this has nothing to do with ADA, just the exchanges"
1616088286,"do not see it as a big move for it, maybe a lil increase %"
1616088292,after tides chill
1616088292,"if the coinbasers go really crazy, everything is possible 😄"
1616088453,Anybody in on REN?
1616088467,It's up 10%
1616088556,ADA diving again.  Good thing I didn't buy back in!  Thanks @Blackhartd
1616088570,Ada is going down now
1616088582,It has to
1616088612,"Reconnected to net and saw 0 positions at. ADA, had a mini heart attack before it refreshed back to normal"
1616088672,ADA hit my SL but still netted a little profit
1616088676,buying any coin on a day that has this much move
1616088678,Time to look at something else
1616088681,is just a fools move
1616088688,unless you wanna gamble on futures
1616088691,thats up to you
1616088720,"wait until things go quiet and then go in for some weeks or months, even longer if you want"
1616088936,Whats CMT doing
1616089472,I hate being in long for too long
1616089560,Maybe should short ADA😆
1616089695,Jeesus ada stop dipping already
1616089701,AaaaaaAaAaaa
1616089738,"I guess that wasn't the bottom of the dip after all 🥴 It looked so calm around 1,35"
1616089763,scam coin
1616089815,Ada will go bellow 1.2
1616089826,And i had so much faith in ADA unlike ENJ
1616089836,Stop
1616089848,You guys think it only goes up
1616089852,Spreading pain
1616089858,That's why I don't mess with futurws
1616089870,Spot is like live to fight another day
1616089876,Im still down 7 bucks on ada if im even again imma sell
1616089891,Im gonna get a heart attack if i keep any longer
1616089916,Yeah i should have taken the way out at 1.36.  My entry price
1616089916,@MotoMoto i spent days without sleep because of futures
1616089924,That's a drug
1616089930,Did you add to your margin mate? :c
1616089970,Crypto is a drug my school is suffering bcs of this
1616089978,so as far as I can tell anytime a bunch of people in here yell ADA to $2 they are making that up? cause every single time someone talks about ADA and one of these new listings it just sinks
1616089984,Damn LUKSO 😭
1616090006,It's not always up
1616090015,So the French are auctioning off 28mil euro worth of confiscated bitcoin lol
1616090017,I said it would dump :p
1616090019,I wish it was like that
1616090022,Well 1.35 looks like a good support for ada
1616090026,Because of prepump
1616090027,naw true you did
1616090053,I mean i dont really care im still sitting on 500 ADA at .43 so
1616090071,But why didn’t I believe in myself and short? Idk
1616090072,just trying to figure out how to read the people pumping shit
1616090103,I have like 2800 Ada at 1.2
1616090123,Don’t know why the other coins pumped tho with the listing
1616090129,That was strange
1616090153,"yeah im new still, trying to get used to the ebb and flow"
1616090162,Perhaps Ada is just more high visibility
1616090174,only reason I started paying attention to Crypto is a rapper paid me for a beat in Doge like a year back lol
1616090184,"From what I've learnt so far, don't always expect a logical ""ebb and flow"" 🤷‍♂️"
1616090194,oh well yeah
1616090198,"Once the news to an event comes out, buy it then"
1616090199,😅
1616090206,And sell before the event itself lol
1616090215,This
1616090222,yeah that parts becoming pretty apparent after the past few
1616090231,been too scared to short stuff lol
1616090239,but im learning lol
1616090241,"yes, but I paper-handed out to save at least some of it"
1616090247,Not the right market to short tho
1616090268,Just triggered my 2.4 buy in. Might brake even at 1.3 now
1616090271,so far just sitting on a bunch of stuff I got a couple months ago is working well over all
1616090273,1.24
1616090276,and its less stressful lol
1616090297,i think im gonna buy back in now
1616090299,no futures
1616090301,just hard coin
1616090305,If you bought stuff in December you are golden now
1616090307,That's exactly my point
1616090319,My health was sufdering
1616090329,yeah first purchase was around christmas
1616090335,And spent many time just looking at the charts
1616090341,Damn 1.24 is a nice catch of a rebound
1616090371,Smart :godsgardener:
1616090379,"im not as stressed about ADA in general as I really like the tech behind it, curious to see if it really catches on"
1616090392,Yeah but i have no faith in it going much higher
1616090408,isnt the listing on regular coinbase only a few hours after pro?
1616090421,About 2-3 h
1616090472,Wait for ada to correct properly
1616090479,ADA in general will be fine and will more than double from where it is now. The question is what ADA will do this evening.
1616090486,"My recommendation would be wait a few days, but thats just me"
1616090501,OMI boutta break 0.01
1616090504,U should do what u think is best
1616090504,i dont think we can wait a few days right?
1616090515,the listing on the full website should in like max 48 hrs?>
1616090532,"yeah its suuuuper interesting to watch tho, I have learned a ton in here"
1616090540,Sorry
1616090549,i do??
1616090554,i mean ada
1616090559,Ohhhh
1616090562,Then yeah why not
1616090568,Take the gamble
1616090576,It probably will pump to 1.3 or 1.4
1616090581,Then dump again
1616090597,do we have any idea on when we know it gives live on full site
1616090602,like is there a funding counter
1616090603,or something

1616092755,"Currently everyone tries to get in. Thats why the server goes down. If it means anything, it would be a good thing"
1616092811,All you do with these comments is create fud

1616093191,How do I find their server?  I Google searched and got nothing
1616093262,boson telegram u mean?
1616093467,@Kayne where did you read about a 6 month lockup?
1616093508,"My telegram account got blocked for absolutely no reason, I had just set it up and chatted for a minute with a friend and then they blocked my account and I can't reopen it (when I enter my phone number they say it's blocked) and they gave zero explanation, and then I tried to contact them to get my account unblocked and there is no way to contact them!  Writing on reddit telegram sub the mods deleted my post, and then the only way I found to contact telegram is their stupid Twitter.  I contacted them on there 5 months ago and about 20x since and no response!!"
1616093518,Telegram is an absolute shite company
1616093585,"Fortunately I had never used the app, but I mean, if I was using that to communicate with friends and family and colleagues and had important information on there etc I would be screwed, because they can just block your account randomly at any moment for no reason"
1616093645,get a google voice number and use that to re open a new account
1616093650,What should be the ultimate safe bottom line for ADA. Currently have 1.15 liquidation mark. Should i add more to make it under 1.00
1616093700,@Kayne  what is that from?
1616093883,Which crypto thingy?
1616093903,This entire chat is about crypto thingys
1616093913,😄
1616094371,I don’t get any Emils. Magic one. Lol
1616094381,Maybe it’s invisible 🙂

1616094489,Was LIN a pump and dump?
1616094558,Nothing there 😦
1616094558,"Where are all the ENJ boys, where is 10€? Its almost end of the week"

1616094686,@Kayne  which email?  Can you please fill me in?  How do I get in on this?
1616094814,What ID system?
1616094829,Is  it the Boston thing?
1616094861,On what?
1616094897,"Dude, I have not been following your 400 messages per hour"
1616094908,I’ve tried 3 emails and no ducking emails.
1616094927,it couldnt verify my id
1616094931,unfortunate
1616094934,There are more people who have problems with the magic link and the team is aware of that
1616094935,You just pinged me with literally no info and expect me now to read up on hours of idle chat just because you don't have anything meaningful to do with your life??
1616094958,This is the worst fucking kyc ever
1616094974,magic link worked for me. just not verification 😞
1616094975,Bison ?
1616094977,Absolute fucking garbage
1616094979,Yes.
1616094986,"yeah, server is overloaded"
1616095011,mine wasnt because of that. It just said it could read my id
1616095017,I’ll try again and I’ll give you. Fuck bison lol I’ll get caper 😅
1616095020,couldn't
1616095020,Bailing from this garbage crap
1616095049,Thank god i closed my ada position
1616095072,The overload also affects this
1616095084,"@That one belgian super cunt 
How did it went with ADA for you? I remember you were massively longing it"
1616095086,gotcha
1616095087,didnt know that
1616095113,@Kayne you shouldnt even be unmuted
1616095122,but you were spared i guess
1616095123,"@Kayne I don't know where you got that idea or if you're just messing with me to troll, but I didn't join the Boson ico so I have no fucking idea how their ID system works."
1616095312,"I had some problems, but after trying 3 times i got in"
1616095343,I got in. But it wont read my fucking ID. This is the clearest shot i have ever taken. Wont read it.
1616095426,THen why u ping me for?!??!?!?!?
1616095467,I am going to relax when I don't get random pings from ppl asking me crap while I'm enjoying my dinner.

1616095915,Waiting 🙂
1616095922,oh there he is again
1616095931,Doesn't say when. 2030?
1616095934,Eventually
1616095970,Least it doesn't get pumped and dumped like ada
1616096060,Did you forget 3.02 to 2.24
1616096079,3.08*
1616096097,Else my short would have been a succes :’)
1616096147,"I's been 3,5 hours, **when coinbase???** 👀"
1616096226,"@Sausage Destroyer man you’re a god sent, thank you for blessing us<3"
1616096284,Ada is going back to 1$
1616096343,Damn that ADA pump is still going!
1616096381,Do we know if coinbase will tweet when trading for ADA is enabled on their regular platform? 🤔
1616096398,they tend to tweet some 15 minutes before
1616096414,it's about time😠
1616096426,ADA crasheddddd
1616096432,"Hmm interesting, it’ll maybe pump as soon as that’s announced again possibly"
1616096432,😫
1616096448,I am scared
1616096452,damnnnn
1616096463,@WolfKing99 are you longing ADA?
1616096475,yes
1616096483,holding
1616096486,isnt chr a shitcoin?
1616096486,??
1616096495,chr is shit
1616096508,it's that kind of tweet we are waiting for. 😦 Until then ADA seems to try to regain pre-pump valuation
1616096539,☹️
1616096555,fuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
1616096582,What’s your liq?
1616096615,2k
1616096626,"Gonna turn on post notifications for coinbase in that case, could be a while for it though:( (hoping still today though)"
1616096649,"I mean your liquidation point, sorry for not being specific :p"
1616096701,$1.32
1616096715,Will it pump?
1616096719,Ah shit so you’ve already been liquidated?
1616096721,So you’re liquidated already
1616096730,yes
1616096737,Unlucky man:(
1616096753,will it increase?
1616096757,😭
1616096759,$1.25 is a big dip
1616096783,Nobody told CB Pro users they were supposed to buy
1616096788,How long’s a piece of string? :p
1616096807,????
1616096817,I dont see an increase
1616096820,there is no hype or news
1616096824,yes
1616096845,CB release hasn’t happened yet
1616096847,how do coinbase listing works?
1616096856,Plus April smart contracts
1616096865,should i hold?
1616096868,Still not public on CB?
1616096876,I hold
1616096877,its alrady prepumped 25% in a day
1616096880,"Not CB, no"
1616096882,for atleast a week
1616096885,thats not little :p
1616096896,Expecting som things till half april
1616096903,"It’s announced that a coin will be on coinbase pro 2 days before the listing, regular coinbase generally follows after that (of course if certain parameters are met)"
1616096936,so do we think it will again prepump till the other listing?
1616096962,Lol it has yet to start pumping again
1616096971,So probably no prepump
1616096986,so ada should go up again?
1616097009,yea
1616097045,"Folks buying on CB are buying above market price too, so you may actually see some pump when it goes live"
1616097063,oh
1616097065,so it doesnt make sense that people sold ada before listing
1616097067,or does it?
1616097082,It does bc of how much it pre pumped
1616097103,Shit was way oversold at $1.4
1616097134,if you leverage and you are up 200-500% you just sell right
1616097201,I love this panic haha. Where’s the saddam Hussain South Park gif “hey relax guy”
1616097222,i dont understand why people bought it at 1.41
1616097234,hoping for a cb pump then I guess
1616097240,Some believed it going live on CB Pro would lead to a pump
1616097260,On Pro you’d have to wonder how many actually have access
1616097262,Hence why the activity before was a pre pump. Little did they know the pre pump was actually the pump
1616097278,wow whats going on with these bears 😄 who made them so angry 😄
1616097346,whats the difference between cb pro and cb?
1616097349,Doesn’t help btc has dropped 1.5k since I slept either
1616097376,"Different interface. Can’t limit buy or stop loss on CB, can on CB Pro"
1616097519,djeezes BTC
1616097580,As long as ADA doesn’t go below 1.2 I’m happy
1616097680,Bought few ENJ
1616097699,WHO LET THE BEARS OUT !??! WHO... WHO !!!
1616097735,"Oh I’m not worried, just saying I’m happy with above 1.2. Been a pretty boring 2-3 weeks before wednesday"
1616097754,Me too
1616097793,@Sausage Destroyer shows nice graphs I go all in
1616097793,Still dreaming at 10 bucks by the end of the year
1616097804,I think $5 is reasonable
1616097866,Although I don't agree with NFTS people are going crazy with them
1616097877,ADA is recovering
1616097905,ADA didn't beat ath this time
1616097936,I was surprised it got so close on sweet FA news
1616097990,My STMX be building again too
1616098011,"Fuck, bought ENJ instead of stmx"
1616098038,Better off buying a small amount of STMX and leave it for a month lol
1616098038,Did you throw anything into LUKSO? I've lost 50% of the money I put aside for next week's Casper ICO 😭😭😭
1616098056,"Not yet, haven’t set up KuCoin yet"
1616098069,"Bought 10 € 2,3 weeks ago"
1616098070,"Supposed to be going long on LUKSO, remember?"
1616098074,Now I have 30
1616098115,Nice turnover then. I have about $300 in it rn
1616098133,"No choice now! The previous week to my buying some, it had a decent rise. As soon as I buy, it tanks"
1616098135,Hopefully ride it to 5c eventually
1616098143,Just used 60 bucks to buy random coins
1616098149,That’s the market for you lol. Sorry for your loss
1616098208,Need your help guys
1616098217,Should I use my Ada to buy 1 eth?
1616098242,do whatever you want. we arent going to spoonfeed you your moves
1616098256,"Johnny Woo says, never jump coins"
1616098260,Just asking opinions
1616098294,"Do you think ETH is going to go up a higher percentage than ADA? If so, jump. If not, hold position"
1616098313,I converted one coin to another twice. Both times I’ve regretted it.
1616098322,"ADA going nowhere, while everything else goes green"
1616098328,My experience is the same
1616098346,Yep I did that 1st March BTC to ADA. Lost so much
1616098349,bah its not like it rose like 25 cents
1616098365,see
1616098384,Just add in Fiat then buy
1616098393,Always top up your portfolio
1616098393,One of the times was UNI back at $18. Really wish I’d held out.
1616098397,https://tenor.com/view/ferrari-car-swift-drift-gif-14696521
1616098401,That kinda Fiat?
1616098405,But I converted link to hot
1616098410,"and this is why you’re exceptionally salty about anything ADA now. I didn’t even say anything in terms of buying one over the other lol, just tried to get him to go off his gut"
1616098425,Tripled the money and link is even lower
1616098454,Yeah you gotta learn from your mistakes.... And this was my big one
1616098467,And LUKSO
1616098471,😭
1616098479,"In fact, do the opposite of what I do"
1616098485,Why did you bought lukso?
1616098489,Then you'll be rich
1616098505,"Post grads call, plus saw it nicely rising steadily"
1616098534,Interesting holding pattern for ENJ
1616098556,boston's company they decided for KYC is pissing me oooooffff
1616098584,"I put 11 bucks in wink, 11 in btt, 11 in hot, 11 in stmx, 11 in pundi x"
1616098592,Jan is still long on LUKSO
1616098618,"Wink and btt still the same, hot and stmx tripled, and pundi X I have 15"
1616098620,But there’s like three o’s in “looong” so maybe he means really long
1616098638,It means years.....
1616098641,Same
1616098768,holding 10 dollar for years seems crazy :p
1616098784,I assume you are looking for more high risk high reward then
1616098891,break 4000sat and all in nano
1616099011,"hold, don't sell"
1616099014,$10 of BTC years ago is now worth what?
1616099029,"I know it's down a bit, but LUKSO is something for months to come"
1616099029,Yeah no choice now 😂
1616099052,"I wouldn't know, I sold most my BTCs at 24 €"
1616099070,"It's only $800 so not the end of the world, so I'll hold out for a while"
1616099082,1.28....... i see that price for more than hour now....
1616099086,Move ADA
1616099092,20% down will feel like nothing when we 3x or 5x or more
1616099298,TBH
1616099306,ada not dropping past 1.2 is EXCELLENT news
1616099421,Where could you even buy btc then?
1616099435,"as long as it stays that way, I agree whole heartedly"
1616099445,I mean it was an obscure idea back then

1616099754,I feel like I am in your ENJ situation now belgian
1616099759,Keep on adding margin
1616099777,Ending up having way more margin then money in it
1616099783,Hey eventually you will be at 1x and then you cant liquidate anymore

1616099810,Didn’t think about that
1616099816,800 dollars per ENJ
1616099817,Seems a solid strat
1616099824,Better then being liquidated I guess
1616099860,I started putting 200 dollars in
1616099867,And now I have 1.5k
1616099875,That escalated quickly :’)

1616100926,Who’s in on BOG?
1616100931,"I know, I was kidding"
1616101068,I think it will dip once more before  the jump
1616101105,ohh
1616101118,Then i'll wait
1616101120,But I'm no expert

1616101142,Yeah I’m gonna wait but not sure when I should cut losses and jump in on
1616101154,yeah

1616101598,I think we don't have many time left to make money with crypto
1616101607,why?
1616101614,"Oh no yeah of course, but I trust your judgements 100% so if I make profit from CHR, I’ll put the profits into XRP I think :p"
1616101623,"Good point, both regulation and mass adoption are coming."
1616101632,Won’t be much I doubt but hey ho

1616103009,A plumber is like 35 or something

1616103053,Belgian school are cheap too
1616103059,I am excited to come in Canada
1616103062,But uk is crazy
1616103075,I think I'm going to norway
1616103094,The only negative thing is that I don't like the cold
1616103106,"You don't even have to speak Norwegian, at most construction sites the language is Polish."
1616103108,"I mean, English"
1616103132,So your choice is between poverty or putting on a jacket 😄
1616103178,id rather dress in layers than be hot af in the boiling sun
1616103181,I'm counting on ada
1616103259,student loans here are pretty great tbh
1616103300,im going to school for 8000$ theyre giving me 12000$ in grants for the cost of living
1616103311,i have my first student loan in RSR
1616103315,😂
1616103359,I have ENJ too
1616103539,ENJ looks stable for now
1616103666,A little bit too high to jump on it
1616103855,Where is Dazz and ENJineer ? Did they went and made their own pump group to get ENJ to 10€ bu the end of week?
1616103907,I sure hope they succeed 😄
1616103924,Yup
1616103934,Any views on CHR?
1616103964,Not much to talk about ENJ atm
1616103967,any one managed KYS for Buson? i got link but 1 hour of trying pics of passpot that is very clear.. not recognised.. I am about to give up!
1616104047,"Yeah, tried it with passport and driver's license... i gave up after 10 mins lol"
1616104129,"Yes. By CryptoDomme in #🎓post-grads-podium, which is available to Sophomore rank and up. 😉"
1616104140,"tried with passpoet and ID and it was as clear as it can be.  and no luck!  either stupid  app for it, or its a sign to give up in buson."
1616104166,In it with a *20 leverage
1616104183,Need to put in more margin before I go to bed lol
1616104193,"I was really hyped about it.  Got some calls here from post graduates.  Got in at 0.26 while it was rising from just 0.10  it rocketed to 0.74 and than fell back, now it seems to stabilize a bit"
1616104222,when it will boost again?
1616104240,0.10 was the launchprice?
1616104271,Who knows..... But i dont think it has as stable ground as for example ENJ or ADA
1616104297,Tomorrow that new game using enj comes out
1616104313,It will decrease more then right?
1616104356,"O.07 actually, thats where it took off"
1616104369,Dammmmnnnn
1616104377,But not in Binance then yet?
1616104393,In binance
1616104400,What makes you think that?
1616104418,Its in the right category of the other hypes
1616104423,Alice is using it
1616104449,"Im just not sure of its volume, is it capped or not"
1616104471,I lost lots of money in CHR today
1616104479,How?
1616104485,It didn’t move all day lol
1616104493,Imagine having bag of CHR when it was 0.7 and selling at 0.70
1616104494,Look a the chart
1616104503,Yea I bought it this morning
1616104505,0.4
1616104512,"It moved@to@0,38"
1616104517,"Then to 0,42"
1616104524,"And now it’s 0,395"
1616104534,"Yeah, you can only loose a lot if you play with futures"
1616104543,So not sure how you can loose money
1616104549,yeah fucking futures
1616104553,😭
1616104560,Did you 50x it :kekw:
1616104565,What leverage? :p
1616104579,10x
1616104588,"You can win and you can lose, in a day I made 800 dollars with 50"
1616104589,I bought at 0.4 and my liquidation is 0.33
1616104599,With *20 leverage
1616104603,Next day lost it all in one movement
1616104620,Huh
1616104624,So again not sure how you lost a lot off money :p
1616104625,How
1616104634,CHR is unlucky coin for me LOL
1616104635,What was the margin?
1616104675,"I'll tell you my movements, long xrp when it was at 0.43 usd, longed reef, shorted alice"
1616104675,50 to 800
1616104679,This is crazy
1616104691,Oooooor... Imagine buying CHR a month ago and then dumping everything on Black Tuesday
1616104693,Oh
1616104701,I thought 1 big movement
1616104708,50 leverage is gambling
1616104720,ok
1616104735,i started calculating how much % i missed out on tonight by either being slow
1616104737,or scared
1616104744,who wants to see the number
1616104755,"Shorted Alice once more, it went from 16 € to almost 18 to drop again to 16 then 15"
1616104769,ENJ pump tomorrow i think
1616104770,But I was liquidated near 18
1616104812,me
1616104813,(it was 40000% max)
1616104825,Leave that to dazzy lol
1616104831,4s too slow or something on shorting the large red ada candle
1616104837,forgetting to long on the way back up
1616104841,hey peole
1616104850,and then CANCELLING MY 75x AT 1.4
1616104853,SHORT
1616104853,Saw 39 and nearly jumped.....than realized  im watching CHR and damn ADA is still at 1.28
1616104857,?
1616104868,Hé is our local ENJ shiller
1616104875,ohh
1616104883,then i calculated all the %
1616104884,He's the evENJelist
1616104890,Only ENJ can save me now @kittiewitty
1616104895,!warn @verydoge spam
1616104896,
1616104908,roughly 1k% 500% and 800%
1616104917,now obviously i would not have been able to execute it perfectly
1616104918,Longing ENJ at this price is risky
1616104924,but even close to good
1616104928,:(((
1616104937,why?
1616104940,I bought HOT just because of the name and it tripled the value
1616104958,I transferred 1k to my futures account Tuesday morning planning to buy Ada and ENJ
1616104965,I bought Only ENJ
1616104970,"Make a research to invest in a good coin, lost money"
1616104977,My stop loss got triggered before it pumped
1616104986,And I didn’t buy Ada at 1.1
1616104988,alice = good coin ??
1616104999,sad
1616105001,ADA is basically flatlining right now
1616105002,I lost like 4k if I had executed it well
1616105019,ENJ will pump?
1616105022,My max is 20 X
1616105031,2% I think?
1616105044,50x it goes down a bit and you get liquidated
1616105061,Yea one red candle
1616105063,And it’s over
1616105103,In Alice it went up for like 2 secs and I got liquidated
1616105109,And I was at 20x
1616105188,"Futures is not for me, I can't enjoy my day doing that"
1616105237,Where is your liq?
1616105318,0.3419 here now
1616105340,10x and below futures are relatively safe
1616105346,7x and below are ur friend
1616105436,I did a *20 but I put so much margin in it
1616105448,Its more a *7 I guess
1616105585,Stormx is doing very good
1616105594,Nice grow in the last few days
1616105611,yo Kayne
1616105628,not me
1616105916,Looking at that 0.3% gain again?
1616106083,Dude! Did you just plagiarize @Sausage Destroyer's call? **Not cool!**
1616106095,Hmm let me see

1616109725,While I wrote 2 lines
1616109742,
1616109765,Tbh i wouldnt do any longs at 3. Too risky
1616110020,"ADA, just when you think its recovering it dips again"
1616110043,At least there arw tons of buy orders at 1.2 mark
1616110047,I sadly sold vet ive been holding for months at 0.73 thinking i can buy lower and havent been able to buy lower since
1616110053,Sad times
1616110063,Ill still wait tho
1616110085,VET to me is a sleeping giant. Its already working with soooo many companies and is doing something somewhat unique in the crypto space
1616110095,It’s a buy and hold for me
1616110110,"BTC dropping a fat chode, so move your SL if its too tight and wait for it to correct"
1616110119,Onyl supply chain coin at the moment
1616110129,Its a dime and people dont know it yet
1616110142,Yep. That positions it into a phenomenal spot in my opinion.
1616110144,Big correction incoming?!?!
1616110165,nah this is minor but its enough to make small coins wobble a bit
1616110174,"Of course with the supply, I think $1 is a pretty lofty goal for VET, but that’s why I’ve got a shit ton of it."
1616110175,Bruhhh
1616110179,I hate sleep
1616110188,Im going to sleep and now gotta stress
1616110320,"The sun is setting in the sky, Ada say goodbye"
1616110349,ADA is still up
1616110366,"Yeah if u havea shit tone, ur good, it adds up"
1616110366,Two days ago it was at $1
1616110395,And? It's doing the same movement as the last time it went up
1616110432,Are you saying it’s about to go up again?
1616110483,Oh fuck me its teletubbies isn’t it
1616110491,"No, the last time it went to 1.23 €, then stopped by 1€, or 1.2 usd, and then dropped until 1 usd"
1616110531,It didn't break ath
1616110551,I wish I was wrong
1616110753,"Hey give yourself a chance, you probably are wrong"
1616110793,"Even if it goes to $1, I’m still ahead 😊 and hopefully smart contracts in April will get us pumping again."
1616110856,breakout SLP
1616110994,it was never recovering
1616111000,we were just prepumping coinbase
1616111057,lmao why you posting same thing in two channels
1616111073,how bout it drops
1616111087,Because its the annoying slp shill
1616111089,i see btc going down so this will go
1616111150,all the people doesn't have alll the channels bc of invites
1616111164,it has been flatlining the whole day

1616112555,I’m still kinda suffering from ptsd after my last buy. I bought a full ETH token at $1900 the day before the most recent crash.

1616113465,Ffs
1616113470,"Yes, many coins are dropping"
1616113472,But yeah market isn’t doing great. Time for a red weekend.
1616113485,HOUSTON WE HAVE A PROBLEM
1616113489,pick whatever you want lmao
1616113503,"but if btc recovers, so will everything else, to some degree at least"
1616113510,so monitor it
1616113523,Let’s go ahead and get a bear market going
1616113546,I can jumpstart it with a big ETH buy if y’all want
1616113649,I LOVE MY FUCKING 100% ENJ!!!!

1616113886,Still big red candle no?
1616113897,Thats just a dip
1616113911,Will recover in no time
1616113946,Yeah but Kanye was right in what he said by saying it’s going down
1616113972,No he wasnt. Not like everything else. Its BTC affected amount is very little now.
1616113981,I’m so glad someone else thought it was Kanye
1616113987,Me too
1616113999,It’s the running joke ahaha
1616114007,"Ah okay, understood"
1616114034,I've literally been calling him that for ages and getting frustrated when the @ kanye gives me no results
1616114077,ada pls come back
1616114084,Baby come back
1616114098,Ada: Ok

1616114177,someone tell this guy supply has huge difference lol
1616114187,"ENJ, yes, ADA nooooo. Not yet."
1616114202,I think you’re a tad biased
1616114204,Stop with enj
1616114207,"Lol. Its a price chart, not a volume chart"
1616114224,No. ADA was falling before the NASDAQ thing
1616114241,We have to read and understand and not protect coins just because
1616114253,It's ridiculous
1616114258,Lol. Describing the last 2 weeks for me
1616114285,and?
1616114289,You act like it's your favorite team
1616114310,"No, its my favorite coin. One that i will have till the end (till india bans crypto)"
1616114317,careful to anyone wishing to enter a trade and get a coin really cheap. we don't know if btc is done dropping
1616114325,But its not a randomly selected favorite coin
1616114328,"explain in one sentence, why is it your favourite coin?"
1616114332,Tell me why it's your favourite
1616114350,Cause im in the same business the coin is in. I know the market.
1616114361,what business are you operating?
1616114362,Which business
1616114363,"And no, not going into the entire thing again"
1616114367,Second life
1616114398,"Tell me what do you know about the coin, how it is used"
1616114407,Lol. No
1616114410,DYOR
1616114416,anyone have money in ENJ?
1616114418,Omg ada scam
1616114425,"You don't even know, you act like a kid"
1616114428,what to operate about Second Life?
1616114441,how is ada a scam
1616114445,
1616114457,why do people keep shitting on ADA? is it because of the emotional attachment to ETH?
1616114466,Eh? Same industry i mean. We are going into integrating ENJ and ETH this year.
1616114475,I love ADA. Just not righ tnow
1616114477,i feel like the number one way to tell that someone is new to crypto is their obsession with ethereum
1616114482,"cuz it was manipulated, idk"
1616114488,That's why
1616114489,nice!!!
1616114491,By we? what role do you have in Second Life?
1616114506,Lol. I didnt wake up suddenly with 100% ENJ. I actually leave it there.
1616114543,enj was cool to watch. i only say one person talking about it when it was under .50 and that shit shot up in one week. was nice
1616114552,"I operate in the same industry second life operates. Not second life itself. My company has its own app similar to second life, but targeted to a niche."
1616114562,OMI hit 0.01
1616114583,That one person is no longer in this group. Lol
1616114595,no i meant a youtube dude

1616114662,but how will we now know when 10 dollars
1616114680,"to get some info in case you new to this world, or even if you dont, might be some things you might not know"
1616114687,There are these things called graphs and price markers on this app called Binance.
1616114694,Don't worry @Cryptoknight is here

1616114708,"Yeah, but barely man. Have no time anymore"
1616114722,no offense
1616114726,Lol. My analysis is greatly influenced by dazz
1616114735,Having a second life is normal you don't have enough time
1616114739,None taken. I suck at long term analysis
1616114756,I run a company. I die everyday
1616114774,its a market dump
1616114781,To not look too shiny. It was worried you might buy into it.
1616114791,i mean is that not how it usually goes? one dips and you typically see a lot of other dip at the same time
1616114802,Give me a job!!
1616114804,www.enj.com
1616114812,What do you do?

1616114871,Dont care for sexism
1616114897,I have a normal job but everyone says I'm very clever
1616114898,Lol. Honest living down the drain?
1616114902,I do everything
1616114907,"ive done various projects over the years but right now i run an astrology business. i've been using it along with TA to try to predict market dips or increases. but running social media, advertisement, being the voice."
1616114910,Aw why did dazz leave again
1616114912,Arent you a plumber?
1616114916,Yes
1616114917,was just a joke.
1616114922,Not for me. I love my job. But folks here make day trading sound so ez
1616114948,"Not that hard to assume why. Lol. Also, Kanya is still here. Soo.... this server is sort of moot for him"
1616114953,i mean day trading can be a full time job if you know what you're doing. can be unforgiving though with trial and error
1616114960,"If Kanye can day trade anyone can, right?"
1616114968,"But I repair phones too, I make houses"
1616114977,I know many things
1616114980,"Lol. I mean no offence, but please DONT DO THAT."
1616115007,Im an Indian. We INVENTED astrology.
1616115008,"it's worked for me so far, well too. people that don't understand astrology have negative things to say and thats okay."
1616115009,And I'm very good at math
1616115014,ah okay
1616115035,A man with many talents
1616115039,"Its a science, not a mystical crystal ball. Stars cant predict stocks."
1616115063,"it is a science, yeah. they're not stars they are planets and its not about predicting. its about following patterns"
1616115075,"Quick, explain to me the Riemann hypothesis"
1616115087,Too late. You are googling it
1616115088,"i tested it through and through without actually investing and then took the next step to use it for  investing or selling and like i said, its worked for me so far"
1616115093,No
1616115098,Please stop.
1616115105,Because I don't even know what you men lol
1616115111,"i don't have to stop anything. it works for me. i'm an adult, i can do whatever i wwant."

1616115162,"its a discord server, where people talk. i can say whatever i want"
1616115179,Are you a magician?
1616115180,I lost faith in astrology when my astrologer told me my dog would have 8 puppies and she only had 3. That was it for me. That bitch!
1616115185,negative
1616115196,the fuck are you all talking about

1616115248,Ok people. Good night!

1616115265,man
1616115267,damn dude when did discord get so soy
1616115271,You’re new here lol
1616115275,Stopped it sorry didn't see
1616115277,This is the crypto chat
1616115278,stars have no shit to do with you or with crypto
1616115281,sorry to say
1616115285,we were literally talking about patterns w astrology and the crypto markets
1616115297,and continue it in #🍆frat-chat
1616115298,astrology isn't stars.  don't be dense
1616115316,Wrong place to talk about this. This is crypto only chat. He will warn you
1616115322,Sorry people you are right
1616115323,we ARE talking about crypto
1616115330,No we arent
1616115333,Spacecadet stop pls
1616115337,lol literally what is wrong with you people
1616115340,i'm not even doing anything
1616115354,Can talk about this is Fratchat
1616115382,https://tenor.com/view/frick-all-that-steve-buscemi-fuck-all-that-fuck-that-nope-gif-13829919
1616115386,come to frat
1616115390,"That channel as methods and rules, and people should respect it"
1616115393,what they are getting at is if your using science based stuff for crypto talk take it to frat chat
1616115410,"""science"""
1616115414,"""science"""
1616115438,"Maybe he's not wrong at all, church is the biggest scam there is"
1616115440,"I figured this channel was for actual DD, not astrology lol"
1616115443,"Same as you spot wallet, you have a futures wallet"
1616115443,you can see each order or trade in the futures tab
1616115487,The biggest business= church
1616115536,You can use the calculator if you need
1616115576,hmmm
1616115580,yeah use the calculator
1616115592,I would send a screenshot to show you how but I can't because of my rank
1616115930,But I don't understand what do you mean because you go to futures and there you see your gains
1616115958,And there's is on usd too
1616116001,the call isnt guaranteed to give you profits
1616116009,they always state DYOR
1616116039,Binance doesn't have this anywhere I think. Use coincodex
1616116122,I'd be careful of chr. Could go either way after this dump
1616116147,the purpose of post grad is to educate people tbh
1616116154,not to spam calls and guarantee you profits
1616116170,
1616116209,"Well, if everyone on the server sends me $1000 I can guarantee profit for myself."
1616116236,Awww. Is someone missing dazzz?
1616116249,Anyone here knows something about ventus?
1616116249,Ok bye
1616116250,Lol
1616116262,yeah and you should learn to DYOR and not blindly follow calls and blame people
1616116326,Easy guys
1616116353,I follow some leads ppl talk here
1616116365,But I don't blame anyone if something goes wrong
1616116426,"This server is good to discover coins, then research, then do what you want 😹"
1616116460,I can say that I have some servers and this is the only one I use
1616116670,They put in the groundwork Kanye they say a good project or just make a comment on a coin it’s your choice whether you think it’s worth investing in hence the “DYOR”
1616116719,Look who's back! Welcome back honey 🥰
1616116742,IMHO STMX is looking like a good investment. I thought it was gonna be gridlocked in the 20-24 satoshi forever. done some reading up and I kinda like it
1616116773,I just threw 10 bucks at it without research
1616116779,Dangerous after the Nasdaq thing. You don't know where it will go
1616116794,Btc I mean
1616116795,pfsh who cares
1616116801,BTC is a PoS
1616116803,You might. Lol
1616116806,Hello
1616116850,So cold 😢
1616116874,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/over-100-new-bitcoin-atms-going-live-across-24-us-states-2021-03-17
1616116890,Not at all
1616116895,Wait for it
1616116896,alts don't just fly up instantly because btc goes up.
1616116902,Every coin has highs and lows
1616116934,there are plenty of coins after BTC recovers that were still 5% down
1616116949,"I remember before this time, last time Ada went ath bitcoin was falling hard at 40k"
1616116985,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-is-too-important-to-ignore%3A-deutsche-bank-report-2021-03-18
1616117000,what is this nasdaq FUD? what because the stocks are down?
1616117011,chr proabbl
1616117015,I don't give recommendations but imho UNFI maybe
1616117030,havent looked at the price but it tends to always recover to 35 bucks from 30ish during btc dumps
1616117037,otherwise
1616117038,btc
1616117046,you could indeed long BTC
1616117056,thats boring tho
1616117060,a nice X20 or X30
1616117062,unless you do it with 125x
1616117065,then its ok
1616117071,easy 30 to 80% profit
1616117091,unless BTC crashes to low 50K right now
1616117099,you buy btc something
1616117103,whether its shorting it
1616117105,or longing
1616117106,imagine having a X125 long running from 8K
1616117107,its something btc
1616117108,and you never closed
1616117120,oofers
1616117130,"what exchange do yous all use, im using coinspot right now and they're stealing all my money in fees, what do you's suggest, im looking at making day trades"
1616117131,Doesn't work like that
1616117135,keep that X125 long going until 200K
1616117146,A red candle and you're out
1616117150,dude
1616117154,im talking FROM 8K
1616117157,not if u bought the dip dip
1616117162,like THE dip
1616117163,as in BTC value 8K
1616117175,back when BTC was crashed to 8K
1616117176,It didn't go on a row without breaks
1616117178,in the dark ages
1616117186,like there the dip
1616117193,i dont remember what the absolute bottom was last time
1616117201,4K 8K?
1616117206,i remember it being stupid cheap in 2019
1616117219,125 is like lottery
1616117219,3.6k early 2020
1616117225,yeah
1616117231,although youd pay a boatload on fees
1616117232,imagine if you opened a high leverage long back then
1616117234,and never closed
1616117242,every 6 hrs for over a year
1616117243,how much would that be?
1616117244,lmao
1616117260,or 8hrs
1616117261,8
1616117263,is ADA going to coinbase or just coinbase PRO
1616117266,how many lots of 8 hrs are there in a year
1616117271,Coinbase pro
1616117283,ohh okay is it on there yet?
1616117289,2920
1616117292,I think so
1616117304,lol
1616117323,if you pay 0.03% in fees
1616117324,every time
1616117330,adds up to like 87.6
1616117333,according to quick math
1616117335,what should i be using to buy and sell crypto?
1616117342,moneyt
1616117378,Like i said. Unfi long should be decent
1616117384,LOL imagine
1616117394,If xrp goes to 0.43 long is very secure I think
1616117632,ADA still isn’t live on CB. Wonder what the deal is
1616117711,Very strong coin imho. From the few times i observed it AFAIK it always tends to rebound. Its slowly dropping in general high but imho i trust it.
1616117748,someone got a binance referal they want me to use
1616117749,Not on my computer so cant properly look but if I am right you can see it go back up 3-5 % every time after a btc pump
1616117753,
1616117778,Now i think about it. I might fill up my unfi bags one of these day 👀
1616117999,https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=OUNVAUDF
1616118084,My modest unfi. I bought them at god know when.
1616118100,Cant have been more than 150 to 200 bucks.
1616118283,Ada is holding strong at the 1.2ish mark. 1.15 to 1.20 might be the new bottom
1616118337,I am keeping my position until this weekend.
1616118345,And see what truly is the bottom
1616118349,No
1616118354,Still got it
1616118377,After all this trouble im not selling until 1000% profit
1616118405,Enj's bottom are getting higher in value
1616118427,Two days ago btc acting like this made it go 2.2 to 2.3
1616118431,2.59
1616118451,Eh
1616118456,My liq is 1.89
1616118468,Yes.
1616118515,Maybe not today or tomorrow but it tends to green a few% and who knows if btc behaves this weekend it might go back up higher back toward ath.
1616118555,UNFI is a good project
1616118624,pundi going nuts rn
1616118637,👀
1616118910,Yes. Potentially high upswing when btc is stable
1616118991,Weekend might be really good if btc is on the upswing end of friday
1616119068,Is a 25% profit not good enougy for a low stakes bet?
1616119093,This is spot scalping with a multiplier
1616119146,i say to the ☕
1616119149,⚰️
1616119151,my bad
1616120457,brother if we knew a coin was for sure going to go in a certain direction this game would be too easy
1616120615,"it doesnt seem ""who knows really"" to me. its usually a pretty clear indication of what they think will happen"
1616120619,with the reasonsing behind it
1616120622,usually
1616120678,which words
1616120788,"id interpret this is ""i think its going to go up but im not jesus and this shit is wild so confirm what im saying before buying in"""
1616120795,which should be a given
1616120800,it's their TA
1616120804,for litearlly any financial advice
1616120810,whether or not its actual advice
1616120812,always a chance something doesnt go the way they think
1616120822,U cant predict market 100%
1616120829,But there are indicators of what is likely to happen
1616120837,so that is what they are trying to suggest
1616120845,Why not
1616120849,U will never know 100%
1616120871,thats a bad thing??
1616120948,"if a normal person means an inexperienced one then, those ppl usually fail in the market"
1616121007,"experienced know what a tip means, and it does not mean blindly buy in. something you can catch something they missed. there are differnet TA strats available, and an experienced trader can find different things to another one"
1616121063,How many invites to I need to get PGP
1616121081,5 actually
1616121245,ok i checked all of her calls in post grad
1616121249,they all been right so far
1616121250,so
1616121252,idk what u on about
1616121266,i think the very first she made about btc you could contest
1616121379,"maybe she doesnt want to entice ppl to make risky trades, and instead only posts things in post grad that she actually has a fair bit of backing for?"
1616121390,like im litearlly checking the charts of the coins shes made calls for
1616121393,all correct so far
1616121410,with a quick glance anyway
1616121438,thats fair
1616121451,"but if she wouldnt recommend that, then i think its also fair to not share it"
1616121484,Why don't you just wait a few days or so to see where CHR goes before shitting on her call?
1616121505,It's been like one day innit? Give it time
1616121753,I just received a scam message from Petty Sensitive#7493
1616121780,I’m only in this server and one other about crypto and it wasn’t the other server. I thought you should know.
1616121991,@Kayne alice is probably going to pump again
1616121997,you should hop on that if you want a trade
1616122230,You have to read and understand what's written there. Not just blindly buy CHR and expect it to be up x% hours later.
1616122318,What if the 800% involved many timely swing trades? That's nothing to put on the podium because people can't follow it by the minute.
1616122394,"Knowing CryptoDomme, I doubt it's just from one mega coin bought and held. You're insinuating she's keeping profits from you but you're not even following the calls that she puts up correctly. How would you make 800% as well if you copy-traded her?"
1616122509,"Heck if I made 800% it's probably on a #yolo 125x future and I only risk $200 which is like 2% of my pf. I would never recommend that to anyone else because it's high risk and y'all would defo yolo your whole savings into it, not take precautions like s/l and get rekt."
1616122542,"alice is having another go at it, based."
1616122564,@Kayne honestly man you cant expect to join discords and have trades handed to you
1616122582,"what I would suggest is to talk to others, study the patterns, then make low risk trades"
1616122600,You should just leave
1616122639,Oh... It's 800$ even! Not 800% 😆😆
1616122649,I missed the CHR train
1616122650,so sad
1616122672,I was looking at LUKSO because I saw it in your name but its not on binance yet
1616122674,which sucks
1616122686,"No, there's still time! See update"
1616122698,"Yeah, I actually opened a KuCoin account for it"
1616122711,Although I'm usually tired of multiple exchanges
1616122726,I just stick to binance tbh
1616122747,Symbol is LYXe right now. Will be exchanged for LYX at the start of mainnet
1616122758,do you think .386 is a decent price. I might just long is 20x overnight
1616122771,or ill wait til tommorow before it breaks out
1616122809,btc 200k end of this cycle i hope
1616122828,"It is a decent price, however as it could go down to 0.35 I don't recommend such high leverage. CryptoDomme is a 1x person herself so I would mirror that if you wanna follow the call."
1616122893,alright cool. ill go x1 then
1616122906,@Celery im not sure if a 200k bitcoin is even possible this cycle
1616122929,That train is still in the station
1616122969,nah if its gonna drop I want to be safe
1616122980,well it depends how much I put in
1616123014,@Drahnreb  which train?
1616123028,With how wacky market can be rn I swear anything over 5x is too risky
1616123041,Yeah if your paper hands sell after a day
1616123076,CHR. You would need Sophomore rank to see it in a special Post Grad channel called #🎓post-grads-podium
1616123114,2x will probably be fine as well but risk is on you.
1616123241,😂
1616123293,@SeineJanie what u reckon it will go to? you buy some yourself?
1616123302,@Kayne so why wouldnt you just wait and take profits
1616123306,dont sell when you break even
1616123314,just because you're down now doesnt mean youll be down tommorow
1616123390,@Kayne what other futures you have? 😊
1616123397,Yes and I'm on for the full ride to ATH which would be +100%. But I also put a stop-loss
1616123411,What the hell are you talking about?
1616123445,
1616123494,I would be content with +20%
1616123526,But if you say ATH is only 0.0006 CENTS you're lying
1616123573,"If you got a more profitable investment with less risk, please do share and let us know."
1616123590,"Remember, more profit than market is only attainable with more risk."
1616123690,You put your money where your mouth is?
1616123756,"**No** risk involved, **literally**
That is rich"
1616123769,Did you buy a sizeable portion of ORN?
1616123844,"hey, sorry to jump in but i'm still kinda new to all this. I'm pretty familiar with binance. i have been doing my best to read everything i can but... i cant seem to find some of the coins discussed  on the binance platform.... is there a better place to trade?"
1616123953,"No, Binance is the biggest and has most coins in one place. But the early bird coins are only on smaller exchanges and it's wise to buy them before they get listed on Binance. However, I totally understand if you don't want to manage multiple exchanges. I myself am wary of it.
But I'm on Binance, KuCoin and SwissBorg now. Also joined some of the promising ICOs mentioned here."
1616124005,"Exactly. So don't say shit like ""no risk involved literally"" which inexperienced newcomers will take at face value!"
1616124016,For a wannabe post grad you have zero sense of responsibility.
1616124041,Why though? It's down a lot like I suspected
1616124061,You were the guy saying it's going to $10 because of Binance listing
1616124072,awesome thanks dude!
1616124075,you got 5k in LINA?
1616124084,werent you in here asking for trades?
1616124094,I got 1k LINA. Buying more at low price 😉
1616124134,You got it! ☺️
1616124201,"Oh you were the lucky guy that got $1 in the first minute?? 😂
You're full of shit man"
1616124209,Pics or didn't happen
1616124308,"No you absolutely cannot. All the info was there, even stop loss and everything. Can't blame CryptoDomme if you yolo at 20x leverage with no safety net and disregard what she wrote."
1616124341,"Gotta work on your reading comprehension skills, man"
1616124360,ahh good to see people are still arguing with this guy 6 hours later
1616124428,"@Kayne ""the immediately prior low is at 0.35 which we may fall slowly towards before regaining momentum upwards"""
1616124442,Did you read that sentence? Did you understand it? How is that irresponsible?!?!?
1616124475,Gotta spend some of those lina gains to get a better personality
1616124539,You're telling me you were literally *the* guy that sold 10k for $1? The whole volume at the peak for LINA was you? How did you put the sell order in so fast? API?
1616124634,So... aren't you on IST timezone?
1616124660,How can it be 5am in your screenshot when the listing was at 12pm UTC?
1616124683,what ius the pump for tmrw
1616124701,check pump calendar
1616124803,so it is a USDT pairing?
1616124913,"I'm just skeptical of your claim, but if true wow man, you got lucky! Nice. And a great reward for getting up so early"
1616124922,Can I say it again? Someone ban that clown
1616124957,"looking into it, at this point its draining postgrad resource into one useless shitgibbon and depriving others so I will speak to Alanox about it."
1616125053,"It was 1 kill yourself which I was warned for, a handful of retards and about 900 bans yes you’d be correct"
1616125063,You only lost money because you didn't follow it properly. No one said to sell at a loss
1616125086,You can. Post Grads make mistakes and we readily admit when we do.
1616125127,"But if you guys take a podium call and get paper hands when it definitely said to wait a day or two for it to take off, it's literally not our fault."
1616125153,CHR is still ongoing so why did you sell????
1616125167,You're jumping coins because you see ORN up +25% on the daily!
1616125174,That's no one's fault but your own!
1616125206,what the hell is a shitgibbon lmao
1616125207,"It is not an ego thing, you are literally flooding the chat with your shit and draining everyone's time and patience"
1616125228,You shit on a post grad call because **you** are impatient
1616125233,What's PGP?  And how do I join?
1616125234,the call is good
1616125273,What you’re saying Must not be that productive then
1616125292,I did not read what you wrote hours ago because I woke up to literally 500 messages in this chat and I suspect 200 of those are from you and I have better things to do with my morning
1616125301,could be 😉
1616125308,tell us about ORN then
1616125336,"Yeah, what's a good entry price for ORN rn?"
1616125338,"we absolutely make mistakes, this entire game is a game of probability and statistics, there are never guarantees, your limp dick attitude is your problem. I'm still in the trade, it must have recovered to the baseline after you exited the trade, because its currently at .39 lol CHR actually just hates you like most of the people in this server."
1616125349,it's a Kayne.
1616125398,what is this meant to prove? theres nothing on there.
1616125426,He's talking about ORN. He mentioned it when it was up like 20% already
1616125432,You missed the other 20 messages from you that caused me to say that
1616125474,"Dude, I went to bed before that exchange and you had already recommended ORN. I checked it, it was overheated. **That's** why I didn't join"
1616125475,"people are welcome to contest our calls WITH FACTS AND THEIR OWN ANALYSIS BASED ON REALITY. in fact I welcome it, it makes us all better traders, YOU however are an oxygen thief, go outside and apologise to all the trees out there working so hard to produce oxygen only for it to be wasted on you."
1616125520,WHy is hotbit so sketchy
1616125563,"this right here, proves you know absolutely nothing about trading and no one should listen to you - down is not bad, down, is how you plan your entry and exit. entering a break out THAT IS ALREADY BROKEN OUT is a rookie mistake."
1616125586,look at my track record bitch tits
1616125601,"No, not yet. But you never get in at ATH, you wait for a retrace. Investment 101"
1616125648,"Literally flip-flopping on your own strat. With CHR you say ""ATH is impossibru"", with ORN you jump in at ATH, it goes 10% higher, suddenly you're the master trader?"
1616125713,No? What was the previous ATH? Seeing that it's on cmc for only a week now
1616125739,That's because we are both stronger on TA than FA
1616125753,"No, I get the gist. Nice project, start of mainnet..."
1616125768,!ban kayne
1616125771,"you just told people to buy into ORN, when its already overheated. thats shit advice any time of day"
1616125773,😦
1616125781,This
1616125796,thats exactly what you wrote
1616125822,it was already broken out when you started shilling it - telling people to pile into a broken out coin is like shilling a pump and dump
1616125837,You didn't answer the question. Where was the ATH of ORN before you mentioned it? And how much did it gain from here to new ATH 3 hrs ago?
1616125870,"It may moon, but it's. Still. A. Highly. Risky. Trade. To. Enter. Now!"
1616125909,"As I said earlier, if you want to be Post Grad, tell people a good entry price and not just ""jump on the train now, mainnet is coming, who cares about entry!!!"""
1616125923,"the reason why Im a post grad and you aren't is because I assess the risk and safety of the call before I blab, I dont want new people to get caught out with a high volatility entry."
1616125938,Dodging the question... can't admit when you're wrong yourself?
1616125956,"who knows man, fuck ORN I'm not following it"
1616125964,good riddens to you if it doesn't drop
1616125982,"""no risk involve literally"" (sic!)"
1616125999,"you never give actual factual or technical reasons for any of your opinions, this is why you are a shitgibbon"
1616126046,No we got why you believe in strong fundamentals on ORN and that's all good. But it's high risk to enter now. Should've done that at $20 like 9 hrs ago
1616126067,"Damn, crazy how you make one random good call and suddenly know more than people who have done this for way longer and are way more respectable"
1616126089,This crypto shit too ez I guess
1616126153,When I saw it the first time it was here:
1616126158,"also how fucking thick are you. If an absolute knucklehead like you knows about these things for ORN, every man and his dog does, which explains the current price action, which means, when those things actually happen for the coin, the gains will be marginal at best. All the good price action for that coin, has already happened/is happening now.  I said this yesterday about the ADA news too and look at the dump it took before the actual listing and announcement."
1616126185,Only if I sold now
1616126194,You're hodling till the 31st
1616126211,"okay, good luck with that. Seriously. I don't wish you ill"
1616126217,But all my TA senses tell me not to enter that coin now
1616126226,I might if it drops to lower than $22
1616126229,nice dodge of my trading 101 lesson
1616126249,well you keep proving is so
1616126253,That's free expert advice and you're taking it personally and shitting on her
1616126254,They have a point tho
1616126265,look at ADA perfect example
1616126272,It's the textbook definition of FOMO
1616126285,"big news incoming, people anticipate it and drive the price up then boom, shits itself even before the actual news happens."
1616126334,"Kayne you need to realise you are just draining all the time, you can't act all calm and collected after you've annoyed people for weeks and then think you're in the right"
1616126337,"then dont tell people to buy it now or even earlier today, based on that entire foundation lesson I just told you."
1616126390,I'd rather people make a decent gain because I used my skill to assess an entry PRE-BREAKOUT rather than jump into an overheated rise and get burned
1616126435,"kid, I probably own socks that are older than you. I was working as a trading educator when you were still in your daddy's nutsack"
1616126452,That's even worse!!!! If it's mid to long there is surely a better entry than ATH!
1616126464,^what Sane said
1616126494,"entering near the top is a rookie mistake, and you are being irresponsible by telling people to do that."
1616126503,"Okay, tell you what. You do your strat, I'll do mine and enter lower or not at all. We'll see who comes out on top at the end of the month."
1616126512,"I can see that its overheated, all my indicators are telling me that."
1616126552,"LMAO most coins behave erratically when BTC is volatile, its inevitable."
1616126592,"keep clutching at straws kid, but unless you can give me reasons based in technical know how about WHEN to enter a coin rather than ONLY WHY dont talk to me"
1616126636,talk shit get hit. you started this weeks ago with your shit attitude
1616126663,She was literally saying to also watch out for BTC behavior while trading CHR and you called all of it irresponsible because your paper hands lost a bit on following the call incorrectly.
1616126697,"Tfw crypto domme calls coin and i haven't made a 100x profit in a day, shit call buy ORN at ATH"
1616126701,"It! Is! Not! A! Good! Call!
You're up, yes. But it's luck and not sustainable, high risk!"
1616126732,You keep saying you lost on CHR which is only true if you sold. If you're down and still in it you haven't lost
1616126765,Sometimes you gotta take the -10% down swing for the 2x increase after
1616126781,Biggest mistake I did over the last weeks was to sell too early or put stop losses too tight
1616126784,Like with CHR
1616126784,"CHR is down like 3% rn from when I bought in when the call was made, I don't think this is a significant loss"
1616126799,It ain't even a loss yet LMAO just hold for a few days
1616126807,5% ranging is normal for baby coins.
1616126818,when they are in the 'change trend direction' phase
1616126872,"I bought CHR on Feb 13 after a podium call (I think it was Swiss) but didn't hold on to it, unfortunately. Is up 460% since then"
1616126902,"Well, what criticism was there, the coin hasn't made profits but do you expect all calls to give immediate profit by the next day?"
1616126916,Then criticize when the trade is done and not in the middle of a dip!
1616126940,"Dude, your whole argument is a **snapshot** where we are at right now. ""CHR is down a bit so it's shit, ORN is +25% so it's amazeballs"""
1616126948,And tomorrow those numbers could be flipped
1616126958,"Tally the results at the end, then we'll see"
1616126964,"Local man annoys entire server and then ""doesn't bother"" when asked to explain. More breaking news at 5"
1616127003,"You are arguing for hours now about this and stealing everyone's time, getting on people's nerves. Its not what you do but how you do it!"
1616127099,"from the day you entered this server, you started on wrong foot, first called me a trap/man, then got shitty about me being a female giving shot calls, then DEMANDED knowledge like an entitled little brat, no, you can fuck off and I will sleep like a baby when the ban hammer comes down on your ass. right at this minute your shit is preventing me from creating more infographic learning materials for everyone. suck on that dipshit."

1616127506,I dont owe you shit - you never once apologised for insulting me straight off the bat when you arrived
1616127536,"oh shit, we are in crypto. fuck. Sane should we delete this from here or?"
1616127555,It's a loooot of msgs to delete 🙂
1616127568,I would only ask that we stop here
1616127573,ok put a pin in it or take it to crypto folks
1616127577,this isnt fair for rest of server.
1616127590,take it to frat kayne

1616127672,"theres no conspiracy, this is rules of server, stop."
1616127673,No she said it because I reminded **everyone** in here about the topic of the channel

1616131222,just me or is the Hotbit deposit kinda sketch
1616131626,Kinda. Liquidation occurs if your invested margin and maintenance margin is used up and it automatically closes the trade along with some extra fees for liquidation.
1616131639,This is to prevent you from owing more money than you have.
1616131686,"You will get a ""margin call"" at 80% where you can decide if you want to stuff up the trade with more margin. Either in Isolated by adding margin to the position manually or in Cross by adding more to your futures wallet."
1616132184,"thank you! i was just wondering because my liq price is pretty low, but i did isolated 10x"
1616132215,would the liq price be 10% lower than the entry price?
1616132222,for isolated 10x
1616132468,"Wait, so you can't owe any more than you have in binance?"
1616132485,If you use your holdings as colateral
1616132505,Exactly!
1616132515,Unless you add more margin
1616132539,You can't even owe more than what's in your futures wallet. Spot and other wallets are safu
1616132953,Got in on LINA because of advice from here. Will have to learn some more about it lol
1616133293,"Well, you had to it exactly like Kayne. Buy from FTX, move to Binance ahead of listing and put sell limit orders in the second it went live.
Which is exactly what I said would happen! People owning the coin already dumping it on Binance making the price drop."
1616133390,"I'm still in it, tho. 1k LINA for long hodl"
1616133546,"BLZ undervalued, sitting negative rn"
1616134328,You mean this?
1616134385,I think he is talking about his 10 usd sell order:kekw: :kekw:
1616134425,Or this?
1616134514,Anyone going for the same strat on perpetual protocol btw?
1616134593,You're reading into my curiosity.
1616134657,"So your strat involved, 20 mins before a Binance listing, for people to open new accounts on FTX, move funds there and buy LINA, send those to Binance and be ready at 12 pm UTC with some limit sell orders? And all in 20 minutes? Lmfao"
1616134669,"You had an FTX account before, right? And money there"
1616134689,That is not a post grad material call.😆
1616134715,Any reason why I can't post images?
1616134763,"I said how I discovered Lina weeks prior but didn't buy because I was a one-exchange kinda guy. I knew it was available on FTX and others, you didn't give me any new info."
1616134772,See #🔼ranks
1616134976,"Your genius ""call"" also was only triggered by me asking where you had bought your LINA before the Binance listing because I was curious to see which other exchanges people are on. 😂"
1616135022,I hope you are going to have a wonderful day chat!
1616135139,Dafi
1616135143,Bitmax
1616135154,Not a financial advice 🙂
1616135167,Long term hodl
1616135281,can somebody explain futures expiry dates to me like im 5?
1616135367,Do perpetual. No expiry date
1616135403,Contract expires: you get executed at that price.
1616135409,"Lol, am I allowed to make the joke that IQ is rising?"
1616135424,"I read an article saying that Btc bulls are waiting for ""BTCfutures"" expiry dates to end to push above 60k"
1616135485,Oh okay. Some futures have an expiry date. That's actually how that started. You buy something to be delivered months later at a price fixed now for hedging.
1616135590,Quarterly is another popular btc future so that expires March 31. Lots of trading action on that date expected. Can't say which direction though. Would have to depend on the long / short ratio.
1616135605,@SeineJanie Do the expiring ones deliver better or something?
1616135623,Isn’t the end of any normal month quite crazy as well?
1616135641,@seven eleven march and april are red months for crypto - taxes
1616135656,alt season should be huge : _
1616135658,: )
1616135671,"So essentially, if we have a good March/April it could be ridiculously good"
1616135687,You can't really short it either
1616135691,Sounds good. Time to get the cash in over this next 5 weeks
1616135696,unless you have balls of steel like jeremyfto
1616135704,125x eth short
1616135708,like 30 second trades
1616135741,"crypto doesn't really go down like a stock does, its a growing market which is why massive gains are seen"
1616135763,"so when a negative month comes around, it doesn't really go up or down, more kinda sideways"
1616135788,That’s why even sideways movements after a bit of a drop are seen as good for future gains I assume?
1616135811,I guess
1616135819,depends on how sideways it is
1616135831,could signal a hard uptrend or downtrend
1616135848,"If STMX is doing this well in the tough months, I’m hodling for 6 months then lol"
1616135905,watch for trend reversals as well
1616135919,always good to have a stop loss on long term holds
1616135929,just in case the world ends while you sleep
1616135966,This is true. Haven’t really got that fail safe with my ADA as it’s in my wallet
1616135984,"So If I put in an order for btc at 57k, when the contract expires it is delivered to me at 57k,  regardless of the current price?"
1616135991,Only have about 5-600 in my spot wallet so can move it around if need be
1616136039,pick an ada/stablecoin pair
1616136064,probably usdt
1616136066,Pre sure all mine is USDT
1616136083,thats going to be the doomsday clock if anything
1616136084,usdt
1616136291,Wow LINA must have triggered some buy walls at .1966
1616136316,Went straight to .2030
1616136551,"No, the Futures contract is between two parties. You will still only get spot prices on spot market. But the ensuing action of those parties might move the market for everybody"
1616136699,Missed a sweet chr dip
1616136709,If I could have reloaded there damn :p
1616136721,"Damn, I want to flex my new binance trading tool but can't post videos.."
1616137162,U guys know about bitcoin black? Is it good investment
1616137217,It might come on Binance
1616137258,They also giving 3600 bitcoin blacks worth $36
1616137265,For free
1616137274,NPXS doing great
1616137285,600% gain for me
1616137297,Only put 100$ in sadly
1616137324,Thinking of riding this wave and throw in some more
1616137858,Limit buy orders are your friend. Notice the plural. Not just one order but many spread out
1616137877,Yea but it would also have reduced my liquidation
1616137885,Oh ok
1616137893,So kinda risky when I’m not there

1616142846,"CHR and LYXe 4h chart look almost identical shape - steady rise to 13th March, then steady fall. Wonder if they'll react the same way"
1616142860,both ATH on 13th March
1616142869,how did lyxe react? :p
1616142889,"it found out I purchased at near the ATH, then everyone started selling"
1616142961,its still dropping now?

1616143378,Pink name? 🥺
1616143398,the post grads are pink I think
1616143400,purple?
1616143407,pinkish / purple?
1616143477,"Close, but delayed."
1616143539,Yeah. The peaks are accelerating.Also the lines in this themselves seem delayed. The first arrow is not following the trend
1616143551,arent you ignoring the high peak in that TA? :p
1616143556,The first fall will be lower
1616143572,how do you know its not in a downward trend?
1616143581,Whoever made this has put a handrail for the boomers to get on board
1616143594,Not time for consolidation yet
1616143631,Haha. Gonna make shitloads of money then
1616143672,how many ENJ you got?
1616143726,"if he answers, take into account that a dollar is worth more in India :p"
1616143733,to put it in perspective I guess
1616143765,Im new to TA so its by far not perfect
1616143888,feck - did I miss out on the Boson whitelisting?
1616143904,I got the email at just the wrong time and totally forgot until now
1616143915,says whitelisting 'paused'
1616143964,I know that the site crashed yesterday
1616143970,so i guess it was really populair
1616144022,3k
1616144068,"eh? How. You guys would value $1 more than us. Like seriously, i see $8000 and am like wtf, thats cheap. We have 2 0's added to our big numbers here"
1616144072,"3,000 * ($3.00 - <entry price>) = ""shit ton of money""?"
1616144098,"No, shorting it when it falls = shit ton of money. 
But that wont happen until $5"
1616144100,because the wage in india are way cheaper :p
1616144116,the rates are 1/4 of us for indian resources
1616144118,Relative to the person i suppose
1616144121,so life is cheaper right?
1616144141,if i talk to my indian co worker and we discuss how much things costs
1616144153,you can do way more with 10k dollar in india then I can do here
1616144153,We'll i live in Mumbai and pay $1805 in rent every month. So you tell me
1616144171,Depends on what you do
1616144177,its based on basic goods right
1616144184,gas / food / etc
1616144201,"Food is expensive here. More than the US, but less than the UK"
1616144215,"Food, not groceries"
1616144225,groceries is mainly food
1616144242,"Sure, if you eat shampoo"
1616144249,or maybe i dont know what groceries are
1616144253,🤣
1616144269,"if you buy a can of cola, how much do you pay"
1616144272,Last year i lived in Spain and my flatmate was indian
1616144273,from a vending machine
1616144292,"A 300ml can is for Rs 70, which is close to a dollar"
1616144293,He told me that where he lives in India life is really cheap
1616144323,But that doesn’t apply to the big cities
1616144342,"dude, why are you eating shampoo?"
1616144345,Its true. I know people who live their entire month spending something like $500 a month. BUt the quality of life greatly suffers. Some dont care
1616144364,my coworker has like a house maid that he pays 200 dollars a month lol
1616144372,Haha. Thats why i said maybe i dont know. I refer to groceries as stuff i can buy at the supermarket
1616144385,perhaps mumbai is different then I guess :p
1616144399,nah I'm pulling your leg mate
1616144401,Im paying the 2 maids i have about 342 a month
1616144415,What do you do for a living?

1616144957,I dreamed like 2/3 times that I was liquidated
1616144966,going to sleep with a leverage is not fun 😂
1616145039,I dreamt that my TP's were hit yesterday
1616145047,Wouldve been liquidated last night
1616145064,If I didnt pump my remaining dollars in
1616145067,Margin
1616145173,yea that 0.37 spike on CHR was scary lol
1616145190,I have 600 invested and a margin off 1250 or something now lol
1616145275,feels like I should take half way at some point when I'm positive
1616145928,I have half of my portfolio liquid
1616145941,And I don’t even know where to put the money
1616145985,I just need my stuff to hopefully recover atm

1616147154,same
1616147169,on 1min interval

1616147192,Announcement in 10 min
1616147198,Live with CHz boss
1616147201,OH
1616147206,so it hasn't even happened yet?!
1616147209,holy fuck
1616147211,maybe internal news
1616147211,lol
1616147226,"buy the rumours, sell the news scenario I'm guessing"
1616147232,Thats what the CHZ twitter says
1616147237,Its live on there
1616147237,but it's already dumping... hmmmmmmmmmm
1616147243,might go up again even higher after news
1616147244,fuck
1616147249,With soccer logos and ufc
1616147254,"if anyone is going in, be careful pls"
1616147255,im keeping it til ATH
1616147262,there is a live update
1616147270,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo8u1iHcN44
1616147272,announcement
1616147276,in 15mjn
1616147281,Yea couldnt share the link
1616147282,AHHH
1616147288,Well either it hits 1 dollar
1616147292,"they started the stream 17mins ago, exactly at 10:30"
1616147294,or its going down
1616147294,now it makes sense
1616147297,ok so that was it
1616147298,nice
1616147303,let's see what happens when the stream goes live
1616147307,might be really interesting
1616147315,Im not getting in
1616147320,"if it dumps big time and reaches the point of where it was pre-pump, I'll buy some"
1616147349,I still need to recover from ada
1616147353,"this could have been people buying the news, and people who have been holding it for a while selling"
1616147358,hard to tell really
1616147359,My heart is not taking an chz dump
1616147371,i have done a small scalp 0.67 -> 0.66
1616147378,too risky to wait more
1616147391,"true, this should be a quick trade however you put it"
1616147394,Well i would say keep us updated
1616147407,But at some point in the stream things are gonna get wild
1616147424,No. You will just get double rekt
1616147448,so it reduces your long position until it's eaten up and then if you set more to short it will create a new short position
1616147464,"You can also check the ""Reduce only"" checkbox to prevent that from happening"
1616147469,but I want to get on on this chz stuff but I'm afraid I'm gonna get rekt
1616147478,especially with what happened with ada
1616147482,I don't trust the news hype
1616147484,it always ends up bad
1616147494,Yesterday got rekt by ada
1616147500,lost 1k
1616147508,@Tanner 3k here lol
1616147509,but it was binance app didnt trigger my market sell
1616147510,Same ada screwed me over

1616148580,I just read about signing NBA and Real Madrid
1616148589,I believe so
1616148593,0.7 good to short i thiunk
1616148596,that would be huge damn
1616148598,"I think they're trying to get all worldwide football teams, one by one"
1616148629,100k daily active users
1616148637,They are actually doing things
1616148640,might invest some $ into CHZ
1616148649,Chr pump?!?!?
1616148656,dont jinx it rich
1616148657,😦
1616148679,I wish
1616148688,550 dollar profit on Chr
1616148692,do I aim for the moon
1616148698,do I just take it
1616148723,working with influencers to promote the coin
1616148776,I was gonna be in it a while longer but
1616148783,I do worry about a crash now
1616148793,gettin ready to do major PR now
1616148794,stream is over
1616148800,this is when the news spread
1616148801,Moon
1616148815,"those who shorted at .70, congrats 😄"
1616148830,"those who haven't, when chz drops and consolidates, seriously consider getting it"
1616148838,they got bombs dropping in the next few weeks and months
1616148842,I bought it at .69
1616148848,But I’m not worried
1616148851,"this coin is for sure going to $1, maybe even beyond"
1616148856,I know it will go up
1616148883,Definitely
1616148923,"I also expect more growth in the days ahead, CEO literally just said they're gonna do major PR push to promote the news of signing with manchester city, so be on the lookout"
1616148925,"ok just short from 0.7, did 55$ of profit,"
1616148931,good shit!!
1616148936,free buck
1616148959,"to say it already hit 0.91 on the 17th of this month, its not that far out of the question"
1616148966,exactly man!
1616149031,lmao yall longers
1616149036,get rekt in chz
1616149039,told u
1616149080,I don't think anyone longed?
1616149089,I didnt
1616149095,I'm not a fool :p
1616149098,"yeah I shorted it at .70, Tanner did too"
1616149118,longing a big green candle is kinda risky
1616149122,"was actually .707, got a quick $100 from it"
1616149134,I long when they announced city for 1-2min then short when they didnt announced more news
1616149142,made 100$ in total
1616149150,with a 110$
1616149154,this is smart
1616149194,"so yeah TOM, nobody got rekt, but I bet you FOMO'd"
1616149198,don't be a dick
1616149219,"After getting rekt by XRP, BNB now I don't FOMO"
1616149230,I wait to short or buy for some minutes if big news
1616149245,it is hands down the safest way
1616149257,hype cycles are for very short term trades
1616149313,that XRP pump was amazing
1616149321,if only I did leverage back then
1616149341,"and then the moment the ""pump"" should begin it just dumped so hard"
1616149347,that was something else lol
1616149670,"I remember very well lol, I could have made 10k profit if sold earlier but with the dump i still get some profit but lessssss lesss"
1616149686,i was being so naive to thought that it could have pump
1616150088,Why barely anyone talking about STMX!
1616150143,"Is now a good entry point? It looks like it keeps climbing and don’t wanna wait around and miss it, was wanting to get in a bit earlier but CHR was just vibing 😂 🤔"
1616150157,Told you yesterday that 3c was good
1616150187,"It’s less than 5c a coin, you’re not losing much if you put something into it"
1616150244,whywas it?
1616150254,Fair enough :p
1616150611,Stmx 4x my investment
1616150633,I only regret not have put more 😢
1616150818,QKC/STMX/SC was so free
1616150952,Imagine entering into STMX and it just drops 🙂
1616150955,btcst can go to 400 again?
1616150955,Couldn’t be me 🙂
1616151077,wtf im from brazil and have never heard about that coin
1616151117,idk lol that's what they said on the livestream
1616151143,You have to wait until it goes up again
1616151158,That's why I don't mess with futures
1616151168,Just spot
1616151178,STMX doesn’t have a future iirc yeah just spot for me
1616151184,Well just don't get into stmx rn
1616151187,"Should have waited, I FOMO’d"
1616151222,Stmx for me was just a gamble but it's paying off
1616151225,"But was wanting to get into it yesterday and it’s gone up 40% since then, was gonna use some profits from CHR but she was a slow moving train :p"
1616151255,I'm holding to wink and it stays the same 😹 😹
1616151276,Used a couple bucks to buy the cheapest coins
1616151308,Losing money in none
1616151669,CHR TP?
1616151859,"Hey so quickly before getting into CHR, I'm bit stressed out as I don't know how to close my long on ONE. Has a new ATH been reached yet? Where would you close it?

I'm gonna look into Fibonacci retracements for price discovery and stuff for CHR when my mind can be at peace xD"
1616151870,Stmx
1616151874,Babe
1616151897,"Just got into STMX, hope I’m not too late"
1616151961,Lol my oxt and reef going nice this morning
1616152393,i think CHR will reach 0.42 then slowly reach 0.43 if BTC don't crash
1616152563,Anyone done a fibo on chr?!?
1616152584,Id love for it to moon to 50 cents
1616152659,I'd sell my  at .0.50 🙂
1616152667,"Man, imagine if Kayne didnt sell CHR at a loss and just held like the call told him to... just crazy"
1616152814,what is a fibo?
1616152848,I am rooting for you to be right
1616152867,i just entered CHR like 5 mins ago
1616153086,"Still can't get fucking Boson KYC working! Grrrrr...
Took photos of ID, was accepted... now try to take selfie, says "" You did not allow the browser to use the camera.""
YES I DID!!!!!!"
1616153094,"Okay, don't take my money. Fine! I give up"
1616153289,So are you expecting CHR to go high today?
1616153325,what happened with btcst?
1616153349,coin burn
1616153358,10:1
1616153501,Any idea what’s going with xlm it’s so calm since the past 2 weeks don’t even look like a crypto 😂 on the 1 day chart
1616153575,i see 1 candle stick
1616153619,Don't coin burns reduce supply? So shouldn't it have gone up not down?
1616153639,I think that our post grads said that you should look into taking profits at this point already
1616153643,thats what she said
1616153701,yea boston hasnt been kind to me either
1616153709,the 0.42 sell wall on CHR has moved to 0.43 :p
1616153900,Because of the Tea Party?
1616153943,😹
1616153946,chr moving up still
1616154163,Fibonacci retracement
1616154215,Rightttt such a stupid system
1616154229,I managed to get my information sent for review
1616154244,"But watch them email me, saying something was hard to read or something"
1616154246,0.43 also shrinking
1616154263,130% up
1616154266,Chr flying
1616154267,sell; dont sell
1616154291,"Maybe they are dyslexic? Check your privilege, Richy. 🙁"
1616154305,"0.43 is breaking, just hold :p"
1616154314,"Hodl,  but set a stop loss comfortably above your entry price"
1616154483,taking 50% out
1616154495,I got my money back then and I can just let the rest do its thing 🙂
1616154539,I'm up 10% on CHR with my spot position 🥳
1616154552,same
1616154580,600 dollar profit thx @Sausage Destroyer
1616154594,if goes to all high again I will give you 500 dollar 😂
1616154619,Can someone explain what the post grad thing is all about? I don't understand.  How can I access the post grad chat?
1616154641,"And yet some people (one) say, she keeps the good calls to herself and only gives out measly calls. 😂"
1616154650,"Just sold all my CHR, made a nice £16 profit thanks for the call post grads"
1616154650,You need at least Sophomore rank
1616154668,See #🔼ranks. Get 5 invites. Then you can enter #🎓post-grads-podium.
1616154719,"it's where us pink name members give out most of our calls, usually with detailed explanation"
1616154723,"CHR doing good, just got a trailing SL to keep me in the moneyz"
1616154751,how are you doing the trailing sl ?
1616154768,On phone so manually
1616154777,gotchaa
1616154784,Letting CHR getting above the threshold I set
1616154801,The cancelling first and re-adding
1616154841,Technically a trailing OCO
1616154853,So if I forget and it skyrockets I can take a healthy profit
1616154884,excellent!
1616154914,I'm learning guys!!!!
1616154948,But for real if I didn't join this group I would have just fucked up do much and given up with crypto
1616154964,Can literally see when I joined in my P&L
1616155120,Just cashout my oxt/reef after 10% on each approx 🙂
1616155168,Any good dip atm I should take a look at ?
1616155225,Still going strong 🤩
1616155225,you could await a BTC dip
1616155229,Hi @SeineJanie thanks for the response.  How do I get 5 invites?
1616155242,@Drahnreb thats like the same that I have lol
1616155244,Thanks to “dominatrix” got 20£ profit /)
1616155298,Damn you’re about to make a bunch of money man:p
1616155307,I also have 0.3981 lol
1616155310,on *20
1616155314,I m going to try trailing stop at 0.43
1616155314,what are the odds 😂
1616155330,I just wish ENJ would look more like this
1616155369,my future wallet is 2.7k already
1616155376,this escalated quickly 😂
1616155391,wish I didnt fuck up the first day
1616155411,Coucou @Tanner
1616155426,Maybe in a couple of weeks :kekw:
1616155433,Mine is recovering from bad decisions. 💀 Last night when BTC had a stroke I had to add 100€ to avoid getting liquidated. That did pay out though.
1616155433,hey :p @xclicx
1616155441,When was the enj triangle ending?
1616155532,"You generate an invite link to this server that's infinitely valid (expires: never and infinite amount of invites), then you publish that link with some enticing words on platforms where people hang out that are interested in Crypto or Pumps & Dumps. 
You could e.g. use Crypto Twitter and jump on some of the cashtags that are used frequently. That's what I did to become Senior."
1616155559,:kekw: if i wasnt enj i would be all over chr :kekw:
1616155588,My CHR pays for my ENJ :kekw:
1616155595,:kekw:
1616155617,Enj making a move tonight/tomorrow
1616155620,Its too late to join chr right? Seems i missed the big dip for entry
1616155634,We all are waiting for that 💀
1616155648,Since enj seems to be stable at 2.5 maybe 2.4 i could drop my margin and use it for chr
1616155659,That depends on whether you believe in CHR reaching an ath
1616155675,imagine 😂
1616155702,diamond hands untill 7k
1616155865,enj reminds me of a heartbeat
1616155889,stable sideways movement so far. breakout soon maybe?
1616156273,1 bad move and you go 0
1616156372,my spot wallet can still sponsor my liquidation :p
1616156381,I'm not gonna liquidate 2k
1616156392,I rather go to a *1 leverage then to save my ass 😂
1616156418,and I will not 20* leverage with that amount neither
1616156483,its like 10% off your portfolio on futures I thought right
1616156492,didnt you say that @SeineJanie ?
1616156567,Ada is super stable slooping up swing
1616156645,Everyone took profit on chr?!
1616156719,yep
1616156731,Damnn
1616156747,Imma try and ride the wave for a say or 2 and see where it goes
1616156747,"at 4260, nice timing for once 😂"
1616156755,"If it dips, welp"
1616156764,BTC is doing stuff again
1616156773,scared that it will have a dip again
1616156787,Yes I feel that
1616156972,18h till end enj triangle
1616157004,"its a symmetrical triangle, isn't it?"
1616157029,yes
1616157039,yeah that's what freaks me out
1616157043,but coming from an up trend
1616157049,Any news that would explain ADA hitting 1.30 a little bit ago?
1616157055,that one can have a breakout to up as well as down
1616157062,yeaaah
1616157064,that's true
1616157079,Ive SL at 2.45
1616157110,if i was awake I would have take that DIP on ENJ
1616157131,again sleeping fucks us over
1616157149,the one that bottomed out at 2.5
1616157155,I was also asleep
1616157161,hated that I missed it
1616157173,get adderall then
1616157194,school makes me miss on a lot of opportunities
1616158017,No :( didn't expect the dip to be this big
1616158488,School will also open you a bunch of opportunities Later
1616158545,Become some form of blockchain expert so you can be part of the revolution
1616158655,If we’re on an uptrend
1616158673,We should continue to go higher and higher in the coming days
1616158679,If not :’(
1616158703,I would re enter at 3.8 if everthing goes to shit :p
1616158705,"We are on an uptrend, but that would have been a nice scalping opportunity"
1616158713,True 100%
1616158722,the times I missed an uptrend because I scalped
1616158783,Me and Luna last night 😩
1616158814,"Thanks to school i understand that opportunities comes with abilities to link things, fails are normal way to success, high job salary is only to feed freedome not to have debt... thanks school"
1616158842,Trust me i am an engineer
1616158861,U can go to school and ur life ends up being shit
1616158869,It all depends on u as a person imo
1616158880,Thats what i am trying to say
1616158886,People said ada was dead.
1616158887,Yeah
1616158887,School wont give you money
1616158888,:kekw:
1616158935,Good education gives you a fast lane ticket to more money
1616158938,anyone make big bucks off of ONE ?
1616158945,"My parents both got degrees... they haven’t succeeded in life 😬 at this rate, they wont even be able to enjoy their retirement, just live off of the minimum"
1616158958,But the line is still long as fuck
1616158959,Nah I just think school doesn't focus on the right things idc about chemistry or the dinos or layers of the ozon
1616158977,Or being a scammer. Now that gets you millions while being a dumbass 20 something :kekw:
1616158980,Not anymore nowadays look at all those stupid youtube instagram influencors much much paid than any others engineer or master degree
1616158986,But I've learned that if you want something you have to grind for it
1616159001,sucking up your higher management you mean?
1616159025,"Making money in the 2010’s onward is more about ur brain, than being a mechanical tool"
1616159025,entertainment industry has never been so big
1616159031,printing
1616159059,i know some dudes with only 1k-2k-3k twitch subs that can live peacefully
1616159065,"if you are good in your job you wont promote, the dilbert principle :p"
1616159067,Lol
1616159077,Its about what you do after school do you settle down and work for a boss with a average salery or do you want to retire at 45 and have a nice life?
1616159092,If you are good in your job leave your company asap
1616159098,retire at 45 lol?

1616160207,HBAR is pumping
1616160215,Even with a strong FA
1616160217,Uni might increase a lot when eth gas fee are lower
1616160243,Who invested in HBAR?
1616160270,"PIVX pumped, arbitrage binance to bithumb"
1616160283,Why the post grad call on LUKSO?
1616160314,Why not ?
1616160323,It already increased
1616160335,

1616160356,Ah ok
1616160378,Lukso is a big expectation project
1616160391,But when i share i never said to buy the top
1616160397,Still has lots of room for growth @Vincent Scott
1616160402,You can wait for a small dip

1616160515,jeremy the futures guy also
1616160570,"The ones i know about are good projects.. if i have to pick 3 out of those I’d buy UNI, THETA and DOT"
1616160625,i expect a fall at dot soon
1616160706,oh i also have XVS and IOTA marked to be kept an eye on them
1616160723,but iota is too high
1616160725,👀
1616160725,So upset I had to sell my DENT to extend my ENJ liq price the other day and I still got liquidated 😦 it’s gone up a good bit since then
1616160749,Somebody fan of NAS?
1616160854,Yehhh I’m gonna take my horse to the otr
1616160873,

1616160912,So Enj going towards 3 dollar ?
1616160925,who said that
1616160928,ehhh.. not really
1616160945,My TA
1616161002,i say you wait 24 hours
1616161013,to confirm a trend
1616161025,either up down or circles :kekw:
1616161027,"yeah def not getting there now during this bullrun, $3 tooooo far"
1616161030,but this is the start
1616161141,"if you do some lines, use RSI, MACD, a few MA, maybe  you find some info at bollinger's bands and *_maybe_* ichimoku cloud you can predict the start"
1616161156,we just got above the cloud (15 min)
1616161165,"could it be something? you can never tell, but..."
1616161283,HBAR will reach moon
1616161288,soon
1616161556,damn the volatility
1616161581,I think SL for ENJ at 2.5
1616161609,btc could push it lower
1616161609,just btc wanting to correct
1616161613,that's the problem
1616161615,The diagonal support still hasn't been broken
1616161618,we gotta go lower to get an accumulation stage
1616161662,"But if we stay at around this level, we're gonna crash into it by tomorrow"
1616161672,PIVX ARBITRAGEE
1616161696,why cant i react to your message
1616161697,We get it chill
1616161710,i wanted to put a :virgin:
1616161722,Man. I just enj to go somewhere so i can exit
1616161738,just wait 24 hrs exactly :kekw:
1616161747,my take: going down
1616161748,"if btc would chill, the run could possibly continue"
1616161800,why is DOT going this high?
1616161804,anybody knows
1616161818,"Aside from ENJ, CHZ is ls looking ready for another strong uptrend"
1616161912,looks like it
1616161965,Climbing at a good level over diagonal support
1616162016,"What do you think of ADA, it look like it will go up too"
1616162074,"Well, it's holding"
1616162136,arbitage PIVX
1616162156,or you can buy on binance and wait for the FOMO
1616162224,Ok i may try to enter to ENJ
1616162246,if I would enter ENJ now
1616162252,BTC will drop to 57k
1616162256,sure off it :p
1616162260,don't count on ada going up anytime soon
1616162271,wait for gogeun or a surprise africa deal
1616162311,if dot breaks the 38.5 resistance my take is the next one is at 39.25
1616162350,well let's look at the charts then shall we
1616162403,damn enj
1616162417,?
1616162468,it jumped off the skyscraper it built :kekw:
1616162481,No still in the triangle
1616162502,ENJ is a pump-and-dump coin rn
1616162515,sooo looks like it yea lol
1616162563,if it doesnt break again 2.85 it will keep it this way
1616162589,its gonna bounce of 2.55
1616162621,Diagonal support is at 2.50 rn
1616162642,👀
1616162654,https://tenor.com/view/sure-john-cena-are-you-sure-gif-5783187
1616162668,Will be about 2.55 in 6 hours
1616162673,1h flattened back down hahahah
1616162677,How low will CHR drop
1616162689,I am
1616162705,dot's looking sexy
1616162714,It's a pretty strong support
1616162724,if it breaks above $39 the next target could be around $41
1616162740,Why is DOT pumping?
1616162743,what do we think about LINA? gonna keep dropping?
1616162757,It doesn’t exist to me
1616162767,"this is very true, until papa bitcoin stomps on it :kekw:"
1616162770,go for it chief then
1616162779,would love to know
1616162802,This is always a possibility 😔
1616162839,What are you doing step-CHR?
1616162870,Holding on to it
1616162888,PIVX MOONING
1616162891,So... rebuy if I sold at 4.1?
1616162920,Hmm thats hard to say. Im on my phone atm so can’t check charts properly
1616162939,We're under the 0.5 on the fibo
1616162978,"Crypto Face seemed really furious about that btc drop. he literally opened a long at the local high, 59k. shut off the stream with 105k loss"
1616162999,:kekw:
1616163000,LOL
1616163005,"doubt it makes a big difference to him, guy's loaded"
1616163021,"but it's just proof that market is so unpredictable, even to those who claim they can read it like an open book"
1616163047,ngl
1616163053,if you open a long at a high point
1616163061,u should be kinda ready for a drop like that
1616163100,well his market cipher indicated a bull run
1616163105,guess it was wrong..
1616163111,Well the resistance is right around that level. Might have anticipated on breaking it
1616163114,
1616163121,this
1616163149,he says in his chat his pos is still open
1616163152,and btc is still dropping
1616163153,oof.
1616163156,Jesus 129 btc
1616163172,"Nah no worries. If you dont close, you dont lose"
1616163182,yeah tbh I'd run with it too
1616163211,I sold all my btc yesterday at 59800
1616163227,but seeing a 100k+ loss would probably ache my whole body
1616163228,"Bought back too early, bc i anticipated on a bounce"
1616163233,Who would enter btc at 59k lol
1616163237,Almost ath
1616163270,"If we break the 59/60 level, we could be looking at a new ath. Thats prob why"
1616163290,"indeed, which we did to be fair"
1616163293,and he took the risk
1616163310,"But for 129 btc, i wouldnt dare"
1616163342,"his leverage was 7x, quantity 7m, meaning that he invested a whole million for this run"
1616163344,goddamn
1616163383,Yesterday was a really great opp for btc future.
1616163390,If he can afford to lose 1m we shouldn’t worry about him
1616163410,Bounces were at precise support levels
1616163508,
1616163563,i get that he wants to only show off his good runs and all the money that he makes off of the well predicted bull runs
1616163567,but own up to losses
1616163571,don't hide it
1616163585,it's perfectly normal
1616163772,cant imagine loosing 100k
1616163847,Yea but when you trade with 7.7 mil you barely notice
1616163869,reckon enji will drop any futher?
1616163871,little over 1% drop
1616163879,enji is at end of triangle
1616163884,well see in a couple hours
1616164016,Any good dip to buy atm ? I have a stack of USDT waiting to be invested 😂
1616164048,just wait till BTC drops
1616164054,and buy the sales
1616164099,or BTC moons and you are fudged
1616164107,Yeah I guess I will wait few days
1616164123,FET could be interesting to take look at
1616164133,Thx will take a look 🙂
1616164177,but a good entry would be like 0.57 - 0.58
1616164291,I’m waiting
1616164302,Hope it doesn’t commit suicide
1616164351,dot struggling

1616164866,you have to provide info why :p
1616165085,within 15 hours just wait it oud and set SL
1616165111,thats based on the 2 lines you draw right?
1616165121,not on volume and other indicators? :p
1616165428,im saying it was struggling to break above my target atm
1616165450,didnt say it wasnt going to
1616165453,I dont mean you

1616166118,Asked about the exact time of Ronin P2 and they said 2021 Q2
1616166137,Keep an eye on $AXS
1616166187,As America prints money they dollars true value right now is about .30cents. America headed for a major depression..The result is people looking for valued  assets to ditch fiat. Usually times like this people revert to gold. Not this time. Gold has been replaced and surpassed here in America by Bitcoin.  I am late to crypto and still pretty new here. . But Bitcoin is just going to go up as the U.S. Dollar crumbles....
1616166193,Look at ADA its slowly crawling back up
1616166255,going up in dollars or other coins LMAO
1616166276,"if you look at usd pairs, if you are printing money, prices go up"
1616166282,yes the projects that work and have substance will flourish

1616166863,"Hi can someone assist me.
Around 2hours ago I sent some crypto from my Coinbase wallet to my Coinbase account. But I can’t see it on my Coinbase account?"
1616166908,From CB to CB Pro?
1616166924,No coin base wallet to coin base (normal version)
1616166944,enji on the move
1616166960,LOL
1616166966,Oh I see. I didn’t know CB had a wallet. Wish I could help you man.
1616166976,No worries thanks anyway
1616167041,Better not reach $3 when I finally go to bed after camping and awaiting a move all day

1616167063,Pokemon NFT coming soon from Bondly?

1616167104,Damn these two runs are like back to back
1616167112,Feels like something is def coming
1616167124,Since these bull run attempts are being made
1616167138,2% fluctuation in 3 mins
1616167742,Enj feels very hesitant on shooting up
1616167756,its a boring crypto day overall
1616167807,Just wait until ENJ announces later today it’s the new global reserve currency and housing contracts will now be handled exclusively on its platform.
1616167823,Wtf
1616167836,Better buy now
1616167836,Lol

1616169038,I will try tonight because yesterday It wasn't working for me
1616169147,How about shorting CHR? Good idea?
1616169219,shorting?
1616169232,what is the reasoning behind that
1616169255,It seems to go down after reaching the peak
1616169277,I dont think it will climb back any time soon
1616169287,but also dont drop a lot
1616169297,the resistance is like 3800 / 3900
1616169321,Fibo shows its in line with the continuous uptrend
1616169326,But idk shit
1616169329,About TA
1616169333,So dont take my word
1616169347,It refuses to go below 0.4 so who knows
1616169409,If it goes below 0.4 that would mean trend reversal
1616169418,According to my shitty TA
1616169437,use clouds richy
1616169444,ichimoku cloud
1616169449,could help
1616169504,😘
1616169509,Lemme try that
1616169510,yea I wouldnt short
1616169517,it can still break out
1616169524,and there is not that much room to the bottom
1616169562,any thouht on ONE ( harmony) worth buying and holding?
1616169571,or too much hype and it wll drop?
1616169625,ENJ buy opportunity
1616169633,whale sold out
1616169650,i bought 10 mins ago ffs
1616169657,Broke trough my SL ffs
1616169771,all this ENJ hype :p
1616169781,not sure why
1616169792,Soon it will be 24 h as ADA stuck on 1.28
1616169817,I see ENJ just consolidating for some time
1616169854,What was ur support line?
1616169872,it barely moved on the chart? :p
1616169883,from 2.62 to 2.57ish
1616169925,In my opinion support is still slightly below 50
1616169941,2.55
1616169957,unless you get some really good news
1616169964,it wont move away from the 2.40-2.70 bracket
1616169965,Went down to 2.57
1616169971,and mostly 2.55-2.60
1616169977,yea idk i work with eur
1616170035,"If the ascending support line is holding, it has to go upwards"
1616170058,jezus christ
1616170060,that jump
1616170065,Evem if it's cuddleing the line
1616170086,Which jump?
1616170132,just jumped a bit
1616170172,Literally half a percent
1616170180,what chart are you looking? :p
1616170189,ENJ EUR
1616170193,1 min? :p
1616170205,5 min
1616170290,a quick leverage from 2.57 to 2.60
1616170292,hmm
1616170358,2.57 to 2.70 would be a nice jump
1616170447,Chz going down.. looks like I’ll be hodling for a while
1616170457,Sadly
1616170503,a pretty depressing day overall
1616170565,CHR also back to square one :p
1616170653,i sold my at 0.42  +20$ profit
1616170677,yea I sold 50% for 400 profit at 0.426
1616170690,but I kinda hoped that my remaining 50% wouldnt drop back again :p
1616170875,The hell is AUCTION?
1616170882,Just listed coin?
1616170885,ONE isnt holding 12200 too well. Im shorting it.
1616170932,u think it will start dropping?
1616170944,ONE will likely drop
1616170953,I think it will drop until the next level and then go back up.
1616170963,Same
1616170966,good to re buy:)
1616170971,It can drop 20c
1616170971,There isnt enough to get it to pass 0.12200
1616170975,Sorry
1616170979,2 cents
1616170990,yeah you're right
1616170996,id say around 11600

1616177105,It rocketet out of its stagnant 1.28
1616177115,Should have added more
1616177119,Someone here received a message from KFC? 😹 😹 😹
1616177127,You were a bit late with that announcment
1616177143,Oh wait its not yet

1616177381,Wtf
1616177390,yobit pump signal
1616177396,get this scammer out of here
1616177397,finally sold my ADA in positive
1616177404,We dont promote pumps
1616177406,im in the calendar 😉
1616177420,💋
1616177435,no one join their pump
1616177466,there's maybe 1 big pump group that actually does big pumps
1616177471,yobits not one of them
1616177494,give some time bud 😉
1616177549,"Just because you are allowed in the calendar, doesn't mean you can promote it. This is against the rules. Thats your verbal warning; We don't allow advertising in open chat"
1616177561,Why do we have pump partnerships anyways lol
1616177596,"okey sorry, will not happen again 👍"
1616177616,Its not sponsorship technically. We just allow calendars to keep track of the other pumps; Its more of an informative thing than anything
1616177647,idk why we keep track of them but that is above my pay grade 🤷‍♂️
1616177651,deleted message ty for reading 😄
1616177667,Thanks for deleting them 🙂
1616177717,really not the time for ada to be pumping
1616177750,coinbase should've waited a few more days for the  big listing

1616178142,i wanna open another ada position at $1😫
1616178180,Hah ofc opening long at 1€ ada is safest deal ever. Well i guess you will have to take a risk
1616178200,fuck that
1616178208,never trade ada when it's moving sideways
1616178224,Sold my today 0.42 🙂
1616178262,Got OnE. Sold +10£. For Dent and sold it 10£+.  Back to Usdt 🙂 what else to buy ?:))
1616178285,I am in stablecoin waiting for a new dip
1616178292,Or atleast till btc settles down
1616178302,Or for 60% in stablecoin:p
1616178351,ENJ is slowly coming down

1616179370,"An add-on I just finished for binance, wondering if people have any cool ideas for more stuff I can add to this to make my trading easier"
1616179417,"Cool. As long as you aren't trying to sell a bot, That information is fine to post! I'll check it out"
1616179447,Not for sale / handouts 😐
1616179462,"if we did want to sell a bot and get it appraised by you guys, what would we need to do"
1616179470,"disclaimer, im not looking at doing that but its intersting"
1616179486,I assume open source (with discord staff)+ provide part of profits to the server
1616179497,It would have to be a mod question. Post grads dont review that kinda stuff. More than likely an alanox question
1616179528,They said they are looking for more ideas for it
1616179535,If you scroll 10 messages up you have the answer 🙂
1616179570,All I see are a bunch of stripes idfk what they even do
1616179580,Those are buy orders
1616179590,Jeez complicated
1616179591,"so basically when hits that mark, it buys"
1616179606,The lines are not the add on. Its what comes with Binance
1616179610,Nah man thats like a tesla i don't trust that
1616179630,Limit orders are literally how the market works. Without them there would be 0 volume
1616179634,its the fundament of any trading
1616179683,"Thanks to people spreading limit orders (like my lazy ass) you get trades filled at the price you want them filled, not 100k above/below"
1616179694,its called providing liquidity
1616179886,dot still struggling to break my target
1616179891,Where are the enjin supporters? I need your confidence

1616180198,In my opinion

1616181352,Still have 0
1616181411,"Make sure you sent them an invite link you generated. If you did, then you can dm the mods; You can't send other people's invite links just FYI"

I am done with ENJ."
1616196163,I'm giving it time. Selling it if it does not recover within a month
1616196262,Me every time I see STMX break new ATH 🤤🤤🤤
1616196385,good for u!:) if u in lol

1616196523,can someone tldr me on chr? been logged off today
1616197172,Been in since 20 sat. Sadely didnt bug more
1616197176,Buy rather
1616197243,My best buy :kekw: :kekw: :kekw:
1616197273,Yeah I’m at 10.6k haha
1616197295,It’s gone insane last 30mins
1616197319,Has to be a pullback of some kind surely
1616197331,Can’t just jump 3-4c in one day
1616197331,Entered again prematurely after it hit my SL. Let's hope this doesn't turn into another ENJ.
1616197368,I wanted to but that yesterday but it had no future :(
1616197391,"Through 7c now, holy moley"
1616197401,Doubled since 48hrs ago I think
1616197406,At least the rocket isn't disassembled in that picture. :kekw:
1616197455,Ok there’s the pullback lmao
1616197474,if it corrects im going back in
1616197489,imagine a 50X on STMX
1616197495,"Man, I really need to get my timing straight. 🙁"
1616197500,As in reloading or selling and rebuying?
1616197525,I reentered CHR and it ain’t looking great but I’m gonna give it a few more days
1616197541,I didn’t think it’d be a one day job at all tbh
1616197554,I can’t bring myself to sell it now. It’s been so good to me
1616197561,I will just hodl
1616197582,Definitely not. As long as it doesn't turn out like my other multi day job ENJ I'll be happy. :kekw:
1616197598,Look at it this way
1616197610,I feel more comfortable going to bed now with a CHR long than I would with an ENJ long
1616197617,Or even a fucking ADA long lmao
1616197645,CHR stable as at the moment
1616197662,laughts in 400+ dollar positive PNL on ada long
1616197871,DREP went nuts too
1616197911,Up .8c from 2c
1616198077,"Nice, that's twice of what I have in the negative on ENJ. 💀 I'm pretty sure that CHR will recover first."
1616198083,"Btw, u still holding that ENJ position?"
1616198123,Waiting for those 3-5$ and for Godot. A loss is only a loss once you realise it.
1616198234,"yeah i took out my CHR with like no profit and just entered STMX at 0.049, what's your plans with ENJ, you gonna diamond hand it?"
1616198305,"I've been hodling this so long, I might as well keep it. It's a solid project and it will rise eventually. Sorry to hear that you got too late  into CHR. :("
1616198309,Totally with you on that one
1616198367,It will definitely continue to grow over the next weeks and months. I'd just feel unconfortable with any position rn
1616198395,"it's all good man, you'll probably make more money off this CHR then you will with anything else, don't sweat it, just think of the future bossman :p"
1616198466,yeah. im holding until monday. if it doesn't go anywhere by monday im selling at minimum profit
1616198496,That's terrible news as I only made about 50$ of CHR so far :kekw:
1616198517,So basically when ur break even?
1616198550,I think I need to fine tune that one a little 💀
1616198637,yeah
1616198663,That instant profit though
1616198715,"yeah man, we'll see, i'll hold it though"
1616198719,"Looking at how much money you pumped into it, I'd do the same by now"
1616199002,im legit about liq on enji rip
1616199106,mine hit stop loss
1616199111,"lost a bit there, nothing too bad"
1616199116,idk what happened to it
1616199296,
1616199304,Lol some guys me this.
1616199320,That would be something. Instant tether when btc drops
1616199446,Sounds dodgy lol
1616199784,trx!
1616200391,@That one belgian super cunt you're enjoying this STMX run like a king :kekw:
1616200683,Stmx and npxs are rocking 🚀
1616200732,STMX is just growing and growing
1616201043,
1616201057,ada's not looking very good
1616201069,Looks like you drew a dick
1616201073,Holochain update?
1616201076,we need a 4h close above 1.347
1616201112,it's called a dick n balls pattern
1616201117,Next is holochain I think
1616201174,Do you mind explaining why this needs to happen?
1616201219,we need to reject a head and shoulders pattern
1616201230,and close above our previous short term high
1616201252,"Alright, if it doesn’t hit, what are we roughly looking at price wise"
1616201446,there is no bottom
1616201459,we could spiral out of control
1616201474,i would sell my kids for chips
1616201503,we have strong support around the 1.1 level though
1616201536,It all really depends on the amount of new ADA bought that’s being staked
1616201551,"If more people continue to stake, then our price won’t fluctuate too hard"
1616201580,That’s why it only got below $1 a couple times during that flat period
1616201594,Because over 70% of ADA was staked from when it hit ATH
1616201867,yeah but we've had an upsurge of people trading it after the coinbase listing
1616201914,we need more ada staked for sure
1616201998,
1616202048,as long as they're longing it im not complaining
1616202240,"I think as long as the good news comes along at a decent pace, we’ll see steady movement"
1616202571,Inshallah
1616203051,What happened to ENJ
1616203093,It is fucked
1616203102,Oh
1616203116,More or less fucked than XRP
1616203744,What it had to happen
1616203776,Man this VTHO pump is kinda pissing me off
1616203850,Why?
1616203864,Should I jump in? On VTHO
1616203876,Because a VTHO pump is kind of a bad thing for VET
1616203894,VTHO is the gas token for VET.
1616204095,"Ah, I'm in VET.  Is that a signal to sell?"
1616204120,"Imo, not even remotely."
1616204168,"Theoretically it makes sense for VTHO to move upward as VET moves upward, but it still kind of sucks when it happens."
1616204178,"To me, at least."
1616204574,any update on holo coin?
1616207428,no
1616208932,What's a good buy opportunity right now?
1616208949,@BuffWanderer  thanks
1616209095,Will the market dip this weekend?
1616209141,Should I wait with my USDT to find an opportunity this weekend during the normal weekend dip?

1616216839,Depends on your capital
1616216867,Better yet

1616221089,I love watching these kids make mistakes
1616221094,It's why I'm usually here.
1616221102,Snack in 1 hand. Joint in the other.
1616221724,"Some whale really dumped a shitton of ENJ today, I watched the dip live, it happened in an instant, much like ADA's, just not as crazy."
1616221733,It is what it is.. it's completely normal in this market.
1616221751,ENJ then went down some more probably because of panic sellers after they had seen its underwhelming performance
1616221790,"I lost some dough on ENJ because of what happened today, couldn't care less tho. It's a risk and I'm happy to take it."
1616221814,"Once its ready to recover, I'm sure many will be there to push it back up"
1616222056,Is Tezos due for a pump anytime soon?
1616223052,Thoughts on STMX and PUNDI reaching 10c and 1c?
1616223069,Pundi did a 8x since I bought it
1616223076,If only I knew
1616223364,"This was really good btw. Now somehow we've actually consolidated at the 2.4 mark. One more stable day, and we moon. I was honestly expacting consolidation around the 1.6-1.8 mark. This couldnt have turned out any better (well, maybe a $3 before this would have been nice, but that might have caused us to fall sharper)"
1616223404,"ENJ might continue falling hard, it broke its symmetrical triangle to the downside"

1616236990,and buy order didnt trigger :kekw:
1616237056,Fingers crossed it keeps going
1616237417,Cannot believe BTT has 3x in the last day had a small bag of that a while back but just seemed another shitcoin
1616237497,PIVX broke up
1616237527,"This happened to me, I hodled, peak profit was 62$"
1616237535,And I sold today for 9$ profit
1616237539,I wanna kill myself
1616237543,Dont know why I held
1616237841,Because dazz is nothing special. He just got lucky
1616238011,"SLP in a downtrend, hoping for a break up"
1616238055,The new game did nothing. Weekend is doing nothing. Japan is doing nothing. 2.5 is broken. I got my TP at 2.6. Hopefully i can get out of this shitcoin
1616238119,U talking about ENJ?
1616238180,"i sold it yesterday with loss. but  other coins will cover its loss. ENJ probably good to buy it and leave it for years, not looking at it every now and then ."
1616238334,I loosed massize amount money in wink last night
1616238342,Fuck wink coin
1616238435,😦
1616238468,they're still advancing by partnering with other games/ companies and shit aren't they?
1616238611,I just can’t see ENJ having any more massive upward momentum like it did last week
1616238624,Think it’s gonna slowly trickle downwards to 2.2
1616238715,Damn CHR
1616238721,Testing my paper hands are you
1616238762,What was your entry on CHR
1616238804,3.981

1616238839,Put I took half out yesterday at 2.46
1616238870,Wauw

1616239131,I’m staying in it. Diamond hands with this one
1616239138,At least until Monday lmao
1616239340,All top gainers on binance around 1 cent coins
1616239354,Is a shit coin season
1616239590,Easy 50% overnight on Dogira
1616239592,I went out 😦
1616239609,"120% profit, I just have to take it"
1616239753,"Oh no, I’m still in ENJ. Was just wondering why the price was slipping."
1616239768,Consolidation
1616239785,Preparing for the next wave hopefully
1616239801,the best thing ever happened. thats why
1616239819,🧐
1616239868,What's that?
1616239920,I’m gonna guess he’s referring to the price dipping so you can load up on this thing before it *really* pops
1616239939,"That’s what the ENJ boys have said every other dip, at least."
1616240030,"Well, I thinking ENJ will get to 4-5$. But it will take time to regain trust first and me personally rather loose 50$ and re gain it with others than wait for weeks and month of ups and downs"
1616240314,You take that back! My STMX is not a 💩 coin 😫
1616240372,"Nooooo.... well yeah, but noooooooo. 
This dip came 13 days too early, most likely because of the BTC drop. Even better, it came before we perforated $3. Whats EVEN better is that our consolidation seems to have happened at 2.4 (still may be 2.1-2.2). This is a lot higher than our initial estimate of 1.5-1.7 and has most likely happened because we didnt break the $3.2 barrier. 

So go figure."
1616240411,I mean yeah it’s a nice surprise that it’s got support this high. It’s definitely higher than I would’ve guessed.
1616240418,STMX is my next buy in after i sell 50% of ENJ
1616240459,"The growth exponent in ENJ cannot change btw given how its managed. So factoring that in, we have somethign really special"
1616240471,XRP tried to pump for a second 😢
1616240509,IMO there are lot more coins doing a lot better right now. Fucking BTT and BNT killed it last night
1616240515,"I’ve been in XRP since .20, I think if the suit ever settles I’ll probably make a nice chunk."
1616240526,I think this is for obvious reasons though.
1616240529,August most likely if no delays
1616240576,I feel like the SEC is just targeting Ripple because they can at this point.
1616240641,Even if it lost.  It will not be the end of it. It will adopt new life so to say. There is life outside US 🙂
1616240645,"Idk why exactly they went for them, but I think their only case is against the leadership’s impropriety. The token itself is clearly not a security."
1616240673,"If it lost, it would be catastrophic for XRP. Not for any other reason than sentiment. The anti-hype factor."
1616240753,"Hahaha. How can you say this after the multiple BTC rollercoasters we've had these last 2 weeks. Cant not be market manipulation at its best. You saw what happened when the India ban thing came out, barely made a bump. Thats the only organic one that happened."
1616240779,Wym how can I say that?
1616240797,"Them manipulating XRPs price is wrong, but it doesn’t make it a security."
1616240801,"As in the leadership impropriety thing. Sorry, wrongly worded"
1616240816,Because I do think they manipulated the price.
1616240845,I dont think any of these coins are not manipulated. Why arent they going after musk? He's the king of manipulation right now
1616240881,Even something as new as STC is so random.
1616240882,"Yeah see I don’t know. But if everyone is doing it, it doesn’t really matter until someone decides to call you on it. And Brad and co. got called on it."
1616240945,"Thats what right. I'm pretty sure its either personal or someone said no to a bribe, which puts XRP a moral notch higher than the rest. But that will kill them at the end"
1616240973,No kill 😢
1616241461,"xrp as a project itself is still a great project, people keep forgetting ripple has issues, not xrp"
1616241469,when people realise that and its too late
1616241472,stonks for xrp
1616241477,and people will join the wave late
1616241500,Ive been in xrp since 0.3
1616241519,just waiting on big projects to wake up to its uses
1616241525,Before or after the snapshot run up?
1616241538,before
1616241545,Man that run was so hot
1616241554,when we hit 0.6?
1616241559,Dude we hit .9
1616241566,really lol
1616241568,lemme check
1616241570,\but yeah
1616241571,"On coinbase, yes."
1616241573,I was like
1616241576,ohhh okay
1616241582,"yeah, this sec shit"
1616241587,and misunderstanding
1616241590,Yeah I was using CB at the time. Crazy numbers.
1616241592,really fucked xrp for now
1616241598,yeh
1616241617,Not really tbh. If you believe in the project it’s actually helped you by lowering the price.
1616241625,true true
1616241632,but I dont got money to fill up the bags sadly
1616241639,been putting too much money on ICO's
1616241652,"I really wish I could put bags on VET, XRP, XLM"
1616241655,etc
1616241658,"Don’t lie, you’re just subbed to too many OF accounts"
1616241667,LMFAOOOO
1616241668,bruh
1616241671,everyone knows lmfaoooo
1616241674,💀
1616241846,And so the neverending battle at 0.42 continues. CHR
1616241958,I sold my chr last nigt
1616241959,night

1616254554,you think it will tank?
1616254607,i think that coin will get to its real value
1616254623,and i think its now overpriced
1616254670,So's BTC but people are still willing to pay the coin.
1616254705,i dont think btc is overpriced
1616254718,specially when inflation times are coming
1616254734,i expect ENJ to be between 2-2.17
1616254744,but i might be wrong

1616260051,that shit gonna be dropping like my ballsack
1616260054,"I'm doing the same, what is your entry ?"
1616260071,"I bought at 2.43, 2x 2.35"
1616260083,The last time I was thinking that it jumped from 1.1 to 3 :p
1616260087,but tbh... meh.
1616260094,And then again at 1.95 I missed it
1616260097,I might just sell and look elsewhere
1616260118,How long are you holding
1616260123,i would say wait til sunday at least
1616260131,"like a day, maybe two by now"
1616260137,man sunday gonna bleed when papa drops
1616260173,Where do I search & buy expensive and normal nft's?

1616260306,Holding till breakeven
1616260314,Fuck ENJ
1616260376,hopefully the XRP short is making me happy

1616260459,"it could be a bait... trendline broken, people get out, then it pumps. but what if not, we all get our pussies liquidated"
1616260461,then what
1616260466,I just need a bounce back on it
1616260467,then it will pump piece of shit that it is
1616260476,Not gonna wait till it hits 3
1616260489,From 2.3 to 2.5 or something is good enough
1616260490,I will sell half at breakeve i think and keep my entry
1616260524,CHR is also in buying range again
1616260538,I think it will need some time to recover
1616260542,Maybe 1-3 weeks
1616260554,Unless something great happens
1616260568,CHR good buying range 0.39-0.40 ?
1616260658,"Buying possible pump coins days or weeks in advance, then selling when they are chosen. 3rd success. On MDA I even got +300% once!"
1616260734,I will buy in again
1616260751,Bottom range is 0.38 I think
1616260765,0.37 if btc shits the bed
1616260850,I will place some order incase it drop well
1616260879,"0,4016 I put in"
1616260890,Huge buy wall lower
1616261117,VeChain getting itttt
1616261450,The VTHO pump just has me convinced people don’t know or don’t care what they’re buying anymore. They just see the +%
1616261641,I made 10£ on VTHO lol
1616261644,Sold it.
1616261663,Gona buy CHR and wait for it to sale 0.45. 🙂
1616261671,And half on 0.50 🙂
1616261685,10c on coin is good proft
1616261695,"It may be doing the opposite of what I thought it would do, the VTHO pump may actually be pushing VET up. Now wouldn’t that be something"
1616261972,Man a lot of my holdings are having a great day. XRP and XLM out of nowhere
1616262035,Should we expect something big for the end of the quarter? Since a lot of positions are gonna expire
1616262155,Oxt insult me atm 😂
1616262164,im gonna sell chr on 0.45
1616262266,"Hmmmm, when to enter CHR"
1616262318,"0,4 - 0,37"
1616262331,See if it drops to below 0.4 and you’re pretty much safe
1616262353,I just need 4.2 then I have 100% again
1616262357,prob 39.5
1616262379,"0,42*"
1616262393,I’d love to see it 0.5 but anything 0.45 above is pretty tasty
1616262418,It seems that 0.43 is the wall atm
1616262430,I think if you get in under 0.4 providing you don’t have a ridiculous liq point then you could stand to leave it a few days
1616262441,Yeah i think i will set buy order at 0.39
1616262446,0.22 is my liquidation now
1616262459,I will loose 2.5k however when I hit it but ok :p
1616262572,How is xrp holding up im on my phone and cant check support lines etc

1616263837,Ian so glad i  sold it yesterday after its sudden deep.  50$ loss would be 100 now

1616263979,I don’t. It’s not dead. I’m sure it will get 5-6$ just how long that the questions. Those who can wait should ignore this deep and buy more
1616264014,I got first 100 of ENJ at 0.60. When dazz told me first.

1616265824,"and its back a 0,0059"
1616265831,Good job 🙂
1616265834,"Historically it looks good, at least what I've checked for BTC. We'll see if trading on those signals is profitable."
1616266109,How much is it ?
1616266119,"But it's up 30% already. So if it's not, it's gonna drop hard and is bad to enter now."
1616266138,On my side it's more for a confirmation signal If I'm hesitating to entry
1616266222,Just $25 / month in the most basic version: https://cryptontez.com/store
1616266253,And you need a TradingView account. For more than one alert it costs something as well.
1616266282,"that cheap, I guess I will give a try"

1616266901,But good tip man
1616266912,"Added more to stmx on this dip (you can get up to 17% staking it and crypto when you buy from Walmart, ebay, etc).  I also keep adding to ckb.   I’m not adding more at this point to vet - looking for a dip"
1616266965,lol xD
1616266973,very good idea!
1616267006,No way. VTHO just *had* it’s breakout
1616267042,Maybe idk
1616267047,When is stmx dip done
1616267160,"Support is at .06.  Should be done with the dip, but watching"
1616267161,Fucking hell i spent 1 h watching CHR going lower and lower and daaamn i closed my position at 0.4030 hoping to rebuy at 0.4010 and ofc....as soon as i do it it rockets
1616267181,All that for a .002 difference
1616267226,STMX going back up
1616267262,This is the real deal (and ckb too). I’m riding this rollercoaster all the way
1616267275,With 20€ and 50x leverage thats big. I bought at 0.4018 at 0.4055 i would have decent profit
1616267294,Ahhhh I didn’t know you were leveraged
1616267304,That makes much better sense
1616267327,"Every time stmx dipped over the past week, I added.  It’s paying off"
1616267349,I was trading stmx/btc back when it was .10. Wish I just held it lol
1616267386,Vtho is on steroids
1616267517,"Know that feeling.  I held everything in STMX since .1 and keep adding.  Added again at .6.  If I was new, I’d add now as well"
1616267553,With 10 € made 60 on stmx
1616267706,@TheIvaneh I hope you didnt sold your ENJ in loss when it dipped 1 hours ago 🙂
1616267749,"no sir, still holding"
1616267754,are we looking better?
1616267763,oof oof some sign finally!
1616267790,we need that 2.50 asap
1616267910,ahh I see
1616267927,"we bounced off 2.32, March 17th's support"
1616267928,interesting
1616268014,i'm so sad I placed a buy limit at 2.30
1616268027,I would have been in very good position if it had touched
1616268066,"More to be made there, bro"
1616268178,CKB is cheap and gaining traction.  Volume moved from 9M to 50M over the past two days.  This one is going to pop!

1616268752,and ocean $2 target still there imo (just the start for ocean)

1616269756,Just wait till elon musk tweets about it
1616269780,It was going down to 1.02
1616269784,€
1616269788,The herd follows him
1616269938,It goes down but then it goes back in 1-2 days.
1616269942,Now its good price (you will never catch the perfect bottom)
1616270103,@Jelle when you did research on DMST
1616270114,Didn’t certain things seem strange to you?
1616270120,Rightttt
1616270124,Also holy shit
1616270132,Its like we’re carrying the same bag
1616270259,Some thing did indeed. I remember the discussions we had in the post grad channel about this coin. In the end. I didn’t red flag big enough for me not to buy the project. Things like this is why we tell you to do your own research
1616270290,Any certain things that are a red flag for you?
1616270306,3 employees on Facebook
1616270317,Xrp moon
1616270320,Their solicitation form is a crude google form
1616270337,The partnerships they claim to have idk if they are real
1616270374,Some real bad reddit post about telegram messages being deleted if the questions are “hard”
1616270497,xrp is solid project but imo if u want to make money gtfo of it
1616270500,there is better
1616270517,if ur already hodling i think its fine
1616270542,Yeah i bought the rest of my bag earlier today

1616270794,Can anyone tell me a coin for profit of atleast 20% in 2-3 days?
1616270794,"Well I don’t really looked at the solicitation form. Some of the partnerships are indeed not as strong as they seem. Like the mercedes one. But the OG esport partnership is really big. The deleting hard messages is something that happens a lot. Look at reef for instance. They have the same kind of reddit posts. When people spread a lot of negativity, it creates fud and negative vibes in a chat. I understand that these kind of comments get deleted. Remember that you hear stories of the people that comments got deleted."

1616271136,"Dmst has big plans and have managed to accomplish everything that they planned so far. And we are yet to what happens in the future.  It grew a lot already. And i have been taking money out at different levels. The money I take out is my initial investment+ a small bonus. This I do with every project. Holding profit only money, enables me to HODL a lot easier. Could be something psychological for me though. Also this way i can invest the money i get out in other projects again"

1616276547,Did you code that bad boy yourself?
1616276553,I have just dropped a 'mystery call' on postgrad - see if you can figure out why I have called it. this is a learning opp + money making potential all rolled in one.
1616276557,Yup
1616276568,Oooooh
1616276572,"Ayee nice man, I wanna learn to code one day"
1616276582,so we playing that kind of games

1616276613,planing to.. but  wuestion is when..:)
1616276618,Force people to learn
1616276633,"Hey my lady, thank u for CHR! i made 20$ with it 🙂"
1616276643,Saw a lot of buzz on CT today for ANKR as well.
1616276647,does it has to do with this IOST deal? maybe?
1616276666,good to see!
1616276676,thats directed at TheOne
1616276704,ANKR has a similar trend line to DREP right now 🤔
1616276712,"there will be more than one reasons, all you know is 'crypto domme thinks its a good trade' but you need to figure the reasons, there is more than one reason"
1616276743,How many reasons do we need to figure out before we are allowed to buy it?
1616276749,Oooh maybe she is overly mentally attached to ankr?
1616276755,Like some with enj
1616276760,😆
1616276763,fuck I hate that coin so much
1616276772,oh sure there are several reasons
1616276779,"""He"" is performing so well. My ANKR in the storm!"""
1616276815,guys.. as I'll be going to bed in an hour.. what are we expecting with DENT?:) need to set sale order fro at least half of it before I go to be and it drops down while i sleep:)
1616276835,"enj is like grandma trying to force you to eat 2kg of boiled spinach at dinner and promises dessert later but tricks you, no dessert instead giant mess in toilet"
1616276858,"@Sausage Destroyer sorry for the tag, are we free to DM you with reasons why we think it’ll pop to see if we’re correct? I would love to take this learning experience if you’re willing to hear out my reasoning?<3"
1616276862,Sometimes even more spinach after that
1616276884,At least you introduced us to that grandma while she was young and pretty and bore us many $
1616276906,"i have DM's turned off because being female on the internet is gross, provide your reasoning here and either me or other postgrads can 'mark your test'"
1616276935,
1616276938,No that's not true you only blocked Kayne who really really wanted to apologize... 😆😆😆
1616276966,nah almost everyone here is nice
1616276968,lmao Kayne was really fucking pissy about the CHR call wasn’t he
1616276976,dont get the bad vibes lady
1616277013,Totally. And only because of his impatience with it 🙄
1616277019,poetic justice that it popped up enough for many to take profit AFTER getting banned
1616277034,Karma baby
1616277057,If syl goes 1 dollar i will orgasm in my pants
1616277069,I never saw him kicking off later oh but when you first made the call it seemed very “I don’t trust this call purely because you’re female” then he kept babbling on about wanting post grad
1616277085,Ankr the cuppiest cup I ever did see
1616277086,"`DENT: 0.0065152 $ is 0.38% below 0.00654 $, 22.22% from 0.0053309 $`
Duck yeah!!"
1616277093,we stay on it ?
1616277108,180k usd would be...something  i could like
1616277113,Buy 3 and a half bitcoin
1616277116,:dababy:
1616277131,Keep for 10 years. 3.5 million dorrars
1616277136,"Or by that point, 1.5 ENJ"
1616277145,If it goest 0.50 I'll be looking for each and evry memene who spoke about it to THNK U GUYS  and GIRLS and if it gets to 1USD... MALTA or Ibizza for sure:) and then around the world trip :))
1616277145,Depending on who you listen to
1616277162,Plot twist i still had my long open
1616277166,DENT doesn’t .0067 yet
1616277168,what is good price?:))
1616277170,"ordinarily i am used to sexism, because IRL have worked in male dominated fields since day 1 - but here it was getting on my nerves because he dominated all our attention and others got scraps from us when they asked questions, he made people leave, it was time to do something."
1616277181,hmm dunno
1616277185,cuz its gonna do W
1616277185,I single handedly bankrupt binance with my enj long
1616277210,I ahve no idea what W... im 4 weeks old crypto life world
1616277216,You'll cause Binance to go bankrupt
1616277228,When the graph do W
1616277229,I usually ignore the guy but it just looked very very specific that he didn’t like YOUR call and I was gonna call him an incel but couldn’t be bothered riling him
1616277240,2.59 to 50k usd 50 x long on enj :kekw:
1616277250,"Lost on ENJ, sold it put money on Dent, half an hour later, already have profit"
1616277281,Is there that much money in the world? Maybe if you get all the cryptos too?
1616277287,Hopped out of DENT for $100 profit
1616277292,He said he agreed with feminism 😂
1616277294,That was a fun 15mins
1616277309,the same way a wolf agrees with veganism
1616277341,He even has some friends who are girls!! 😜
1616277345,I still haven't seen you make a bad call. Do you ever make mistakes?
1616277353,"Okay, enough Kayne talk. He's not a crypto"
1616277354,"I don't understand feminism, neither racism"
1616277355,"“I’m not racist, one of my friends is black”"
1616277361,beat me to it
1616277363,Exactly!
1616277407,She said ENJ was gonna run out of gas and then it went up a bit more. 😉
1616277426,Ok so like back to crypto. Is there anything historic that might hint towards how SYL could perform? Or is this legit gonna be sky’s the limit?
1616277441,"If STMX trend continues, we’re due a hike in price again shortly"
1616277444,I have never seen something run out of gas as much as ENJ 😦
1616277457,ETH didn’t hit ATH so I’m incredibly bitter I only made it out with like 700% lmao
1616277460,"I don't care if you are man, women, black white, gay, straight, if you are good to me I'll be good to you, if you fuck with me, I'll fuck you"
1616277465,DENT>.what is ur limit????
1616277467,But it reaxhed 3$! Breifly...
1616277477,im scared not to sell lol and lose.. its up up
1616277495,im 20% up from entry less then an hour a go
1616277497,"Fuck I think I'm ""hodl guy"" drunk. Can't type anymore even with SwiftKey and correctling three tkmes"
1616277531,So the worst calls she makes is when you follow her advice and only get 700% when you could have had 720%. :kekw:
1616277532,DENT? Is for longer. Ask any @felguerr
1616277544,Yup. Pretty much.
1616277558,"She was just too careful and didn't ""believe"" in the cojn"

1616278241,"Crypto Twitter is crazy like that. Don't use big coins tho, it will get lost in the noise. Tweet something like ""I got an amazing hint on $ANKR from these guys: <invite link>"""
1616278300,If only my Twitter wasn’t work related lol
1616278303,"God. I still hope, STC was a wise decision ... got another e-mail from them. But we'll see where it goes."

1616278633,"@Sausage Destroyer Can I send my reasons here through screenshots? Did it on a NOTION document to keep track of my notes, it might be quite a few screenshots, or should I put them in #👑big-chads-dorm to not clog up this channel?"

1616280958,"Talk in dollars my friend, easier to keep track"
1616280985,But you sold the wink?
1616281015,Yes I panicked  😭 😩
1616281054,If it's spot you just have to be patient
1616281099,I regret now

1616281799,Holy fucking shit
1616281802,Its over for me then
1616281840,@SeineJanie this news would of been nice 1hr ago 😭
1616281840,
1616282030,It came in just at the top of the hour ofc
1616282054,But the 15m signal was short for a while. I even posted my BTCDOWN pos
1616282119,😭😭
1616282119,Jan do you normally do long term stuff or short term stuff?
1616282130,https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/807828768219463690/822896238092484678
1616282152,Wow
1616282156,I missed that call
1616282156,"Bitcoin mostly short term, with alts I've switched to longer time frames now because I got too early on most"
1616282166,I always look out for ur sell calls
1616282187,Fuck man
1616282192,This feels bad
1616282197,😪
1616282200,"Yeah, I missed the actual signal as well but as soon as I saw it, I went short. Still only 2% from there."
1616282220,15m can be a bit unreliable tho
1616282224,"Okay nice, would I be allowed to DM you my thoughts on a possibly underrated coin and see what you think about it? You obviously don’t have to and you don’t even have to reply, but it could be something big, it’s on the same level as DENT"
1616282235,I don’t wanna seem annoying and stuff so thought to ask
1616282235,"K, sure"
1616282253,But I'm already in bed. Just can't get away from the chat long enough to close my eyes 😆
1616282279,I just want to exit these positions so I can sleep
1616282286,I dont wanna be here anymore

1616282355,Oh right 😆
1616282360,Got one more day
1616282360,I just wanna break even and sleep
1616282363,😭
1616282367,But then sell tomorrow 😉
1616282373,How much down are you?

1616282396,-65%
1616282404,Both in Bitcoin?
1616282410,Nah alts
1616282413,😪
1616282441,Should I just sell for a loss?
1616282448,Or wait to break even
1616282451,Wait
1616282457,Patience young padawan
1616282466,Im around 2% away from both my liq positions
1616282475,Got no more money to put rn for margins 😭

1616282497,Sell?!? 😭😭
1616282504,Foork
1616282528,"Well, liq is always a bit more expensive than selling juuust before"
1616282542,Lemme look at the chart to see if there is some short term hope for a better exit.
1616282650,"So these last two candles look like maybe we're not gonna go much lower for another 2 hrs and first move up a bit. Like to 58,700  possibly. Not back to the top of the last hill, but not all hope is lost."
1616282687,"Drink some caffeine and stay awake watching the chart, oooor set a tp order somewhere around there to close your position."
1616282707,"You could also set several limit sells.
Cross or isolated?"
1616282725,Isolated luckily
1616282741,I got a plan

1616283823,For me it was bascially the same
1616283841,It's not that uncommon if you live in a small village

1616284293,Has belgian decided to kill the enj developers yet
1616284296,👀
1616284365,At least he's not liquified yet
1616284403,1.89 is still far away. Don't think it will go below 2
1616284562,"Interesting article excerpt on ADA:

“A decisive daily candlestick close above $1.48 will confirm the breakout and propel ADA to $2.16. Interestingly, this level coincides with the 127.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Although Cardano price action reveals a bullish outlook, its ascent to $2.16 isn’t a cakewalk. In fact, the 100% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.89 could serve as a primary target for ADA. Slicing through this will confirm the bullish momentum and set up the stage for the next leg up. A FOMO wave gripping investors after $2.16 could have the potential to catapult the so-called ""Ethereum killer"" to the 161.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $2.66. Cardano price is still a long way from breaking out and could trend lower due to overwhelming bearish momentum. Suppose ADA bears slice through the ascending triangle’s hypotenuse leading to a daily close below the 50 one-day moving average (MA) at $0.98. In that case, it will invalidate the bullish outlook and kickstart a bearish one.
In such a case, Cardano price could slide 18% to a demand barrier at $0.80.”"
1616284657,what in the actual fuck has happened
1616284673,can't i chill in a gaming without the market falling

1616285925,They're jealous of ENJ
1616285933,"also, what I really dislike is these dumps. a gradual decrease and increase in value is what I respect."
1616285941,but these dumps of 1k in 2 seconds is just so stupid
1616285947,how is an average joe supposed to survive

1616285995,Or u have whales shitting on u
1616285996,It's not enough yet to trigger a buy signal on Bitcoin though. Bulls and bears still fighting over direction.
1616286006,The average joe just keeps getting shat on

1616286070,What have you guys all lost money on in crypto tho
1616286075,Fuck. I'm so drunk I forgot about RSI!
1616286079,Is it futures or specific coins?
1616286086,Futures man
1616286089,Futures
1616286092,Greed
1616286094,That’s the problem lol
1616286099,Greed and whales is a bitch
1616286109,Don’t buy futures then
1616286113,Hard to predict the future
1616286114,"The problem is, some of us dont got 1k to trade with daily"
1616286115,"I'm like 7x, still in, far from liquidation but I'm still mad because of you guys who lost..."
1616286116,"This value almost screamed ""get back up you Bitchcoin!!"""
1616286138,If you’re gonna invest small amounts you can find the value in the dips at the time you trade
1616286148,"Yeah, but usually you put only a small % of your pf in futures and not the other way around, try to leverage your whole pf."
1616286153,Like I put 10% max in my futures wally.
1616286180,XRP would’ve been good long post court news
1616286183,"See discpline is the issue, I havent been here long enough, told myself this morning, u made good profit, in thr week"
1616286193,"Just chill, wait till monday"
1616286210,Discpline went out the window when I saw the chr call and ankr call
1616286215,Thirst for $$ came
1616286224,"Bro, that's me still. ""One more trade, then I'm done!"" - ""Fuck, it was a loss. Okay, another try. One more **green** future, then I'm done!!"""
1616286251,"Then it's 3am, I'm back to zero after being up $1,000 maybe and it's all been just a learning experience ... 😄"
1616286257,"and you didn't do anything wrong, you listened to good calls made by experienced people here. but what you or them didn't expect is btc movement and these volatile manipulations. they can throw any calls off. it really blows man..."
1616286261,It's not bad to stop when you're in profit 😉
1616286261,STMX still good entry price for those looking at small gains
1616286266,and I'm sorry to everyone who got liquidated today because of this bullshit
1616286272,THIS!!!
1616286281,"but please let this be a lesson to be more careful, lower your leverage please"
1616286281,It needs to be engraved in my brain
1616286436,Shave it into your head
1616286446,"Wasn’t a massive manipulation on doge in the past and someone wrote a long pdf with all the deets like god pdf,  this is basically constant practice"
1616286471,So we are out of the bottom yet?
1616286490,Damn i hate those bitchcoin dips
1616286533,STMX recovering like a god. Can rest easy again
1616286632,"Can't say, we're not over the hump. It was oversold, that's why it needed to get back up a bit but unless we cross above 58,800 the downswing will continue."
1616286653,😭😭 ONG
1616286669,"seems to be curving to form a new local top already, although it's pretty early to tell for certain"
1616286704,more visible on the 1m:
1616286779,"alright peeps, I'm off to sleep now... take care!"
1616286788,night dude!
1616286827,Can someone give me brief explaination in few words- why bitcoin dips and rises have such a big impact on shitcoins?
1616286871,one word perfectly describes it.. influence
1616286957,"Goodnight, thanks for saving my ass"
1616286959,"Ok, thats a bit too short😆"
1616287055,"I mean in order for alts value to go down it has to be sold .....more than bought
So what makes btc dip sell alts"
1616287194,"I believe the bigger majority simply look at btc as a direction of the entire market, which includes all other coins. so if btc goes down, it indicates the market swinging low so they sell their coins to save their money"
1616287274,"I don't think btc on its own has an impact on ADA, or ENJ. it's just the general mentality of people who trade these coins that enable for this trend to always happen"
1616287276,Self fullfilling prophecy basically
1616287314,that's how I understand it yea
1616287375,ENJ ain't coming back from dead
1616287377,"because in theory, all these coins are separate entities, right? they exist independantly, which is why some coins don't go down when bitcoin does, but these are rare occasions"
1616287400,"it's just trader mentality, it's how it is"
1616287414,i think it will come back to 2.40-2.70 zone within a month
1616287415,"it's currently following whatever trend bitcoin is having, just compare the graphs"
1616287417,legit
1616287421,I have saved my #ASS by joining the telegram group every buddy on discord was saying they are #spam #fraud they ask for #money and it never happened they are absolutely free and gives you only authentic alerts. I have made good profit now I’m advertising them just because they helped me. If anybody wants the link  will send him in DM. 🙂
1616287446,!warn @BlackSand spam
1616287447,
1616287488,"These arent people, these must be stupid bots"
1616287492,that guy just PM'd me with the same link btw
1616287495,What mass group of idiots
1616287500,Sees a perfect uptrend
1616287503,And decides
1616287510,Let me abort the ship
1616287516,I bet crypto is 50% bots
1616287520,💀
1616287522,"well yeah a lot of crypto trading is done by bots, that's a fact"
1616287556,Yes
1616287603,"the more I learn about crypto trading, and disclaimer, I'm still really new to it, so don't take anything I say too seriously... the more I become less interested in it lol"
1616287619,"but IT IS entertaining, I think that's what keeps my interest going.."
1616287636,but in theory.. it's just so manipulative
1616287649,Been in crypto for a month now
1616287655,Great projects
1616287661,Im in love with the projects
1616287679,I just hate that the market sentiment can change in a snap of a fingure
1616287681,"yeah yeah of course, I'm mostly speaking about trading exclusively"
1616287684,not the projects themselves
1616287688,"When u can predict it, ull be okay"
1616287698,When it does 180’s ull be like wtfff
1616287705,yeah
1616287733,I guess we’ll learn how to make it work for us in time
1616287735,🙏🏿
1616287746,No more weekend trading for me
1616287817,I mean just last saturday btc hit the new ath
1616287838,"weekends are no exception, but I guess the general sentiment is that weekend trading is more dangerous"
1616287995,Yeah
1616288006,Out of the 4 or 5 weekends ive experienced
1616288013,that's true
1616288018,actually 6

1616288924,But man. Doing a 30X at 2.8 ouch
1616288954,"Why not, it was only going up and about to hit 3,2$ any minute 💀"
1616289006,"to be fair, they never encouraged us to open futures"

1616304091,"I dont mind short term negatives, what i wont be able to handle is it dropping to 0.8$ region"
1616304127,"Okay, now that would be a 33% drop. I don't think that's gonna happen today."
1616304153,"After 1.03$ resistance, thats the next level though"

1616304559,What should be the buy limit?
1616304591,Why do I feel like this is the beginning of a bearish market
1616304715,"Relax, we're far from that."
1616304730,It isn't. BTC is still at 57K.
1616304749,I still got ptsd from the 2017 bull run
1616304763,Don't we all...
1616304765,The way it fell was just a clusterfuck
1616304789,Have your stop-losses ready always. Never gonna know when is the day.
1616304811,I am unsure of the limits tbh
1616304821,"Exactly. Risk, hence reward."
1616304845,I went full back in when the knife shortly stopped falling at 10k € 😬
1616304874,I saw it hit back 3k
1616304888,I had to ride it
1616304954,"I would wait for a bullish breakout, that means letting a bit of profit slide by not timing the exact bottom, but it's safer. Beware of bull traps."
1616304986,True. Confirmation is the key.
1616304996,"But 3k was a good re-entry in 2018, no?'"
1616305013,Oh you rode all the way down to 3k?
1616305021,Yes...
1616305025,😭
1616305039,"Its okay, we are back again, we didnt stop hodling"
1616305048,👌🏻
1616305064,How long do you this the time frame would be roughly?
1616305129,I haven't done further analysis since I'm still just on my smartphone. Just woke up. 😉
1616305174,"I see, well if you find any luck. Id be pleased to hear what you have to saw."
1616305180,Say*
1616305186,👍🏻 you got it
1616305392,"I think i see the bearish trend in the hourly, the double top with the Mcdonalds M doesnt sound very good"
1616305774,Yeah it's bearish. But that's not a bear *market*. Yet. 😉

1616306885,why is sunday always selling
1616307136,Smaller volume on the weekend means higher volatility and easier manipulation by people with too much money and too much time on their hands that try to shake out paper hands to accumulate even more.
1616307142,See https://cointelegraph.com/news/when-to-buy-the-bitcoin-dip-data-shows-sunday-evening-is-ideal

1616315884,ENJ def worth holding long-term thru the bullrun!
1616316099,Enj not for faint hearted and those with “small bank”. But to buy it and to forget it for few years.

1616316481,My own shorthand info
1616316500,To keep up to date with my asset's performance.
1616316664,So realistically that’s not an ideal entry price
1616316677,Where it’s currently at

1616340757,Triangle has potential to go up !?
1616340763,And uptrend?
1616340796,Btc never left the uptrend. At least not for mid/long term
1616340816,"retracement done, I'd say... looks promising!"
1616340944,Lemme see
1616340953,Ill try making my first trade tonight
1616341407,Should I get some ADA?
1616341449,Has EVX ever been to $1?! 😉
1616341476,God bless Swiss borg lol. Made me sweat 😓 lady 2 days but now back to lovely green color 💆🏻‍♂️
1616341592,Any point buying ONe? And hold it till April for example? Or it’s too pumped up at the moment ?
1616341630,how long til cspr purchases can start?
1616341634,or is it now
1616341724,"Oooooh yeah! 💪🏻
Up 7% now! Was down a few percent and below 1 € this morning still."
1616341742,Good time to buy in BTC?
1616341768,I did at least 😉
1616341881,You also holding some VET?
1616341915,"No, never did. For no particular reason."
1616342863,ok my bag is egld and dent

1616342879,i will be back in 1 month
1616343001,do it
1616343004,You better watch your binance
1616343018,Cause dent is not that safe
1616343028,even if its go down
1616343030,what can i do lol
1616343058,Then you can close the app
1616343064,And come back in a month
1616343074,ahaha 👌🏻
1616343083,I would put a stop loss tho
1616343112,I love shitcoins
1616343125,hmmm will see if i put onne
1616343128,guys
1616343128,but dont think
1616343131,But if btc drops 20% they commit suicide
1616343157,Can I ask some question
1616343209,sure
1616343231,I'm up +80% on EVX 😮
1616343266,Is it possible to make money in the pump at 17?
1616343267,Any guesses for the pump coin
1616343277,Didn’t took part in the previous one
1616343342,Some saying evx
1616343360,"We don't recommend joining pumps and dumps here, but if it's anything like the last there should be some opportunity to make profit."
1616343398,I know how they works
1616343406,Took part in bps pumps
1616343417,Just wanted to know if this guys are legit
1616343418,If everybody is buying it it's probably not it 😉
1616343435,Or if it is another big scam
1616343443,The collaboration made for a decent volume last time. But no guarantee for today
1616343460,I’ll sit it out
1616343484,Since in the last two days i’m down 1k
1616343490,i got 12 bucks and a dream ahahahah
1616343514,Too many futures pos? 😬
1616343527,was VITE pumped?
1616343528,"No, actually none"
1616343533,Just the market
1616343538,That dropped
1616343547,My portfolio ain’t the smallest
1616343564,So 1k up or down in a day isn’t something incredible
1616343571,oh okay... how much in %?
1616343585,Like 4%
1616343607,I'm actually +1.55% yesterday. And today looking even better 🙂
1616343619,"k, that's not too much loss"
1616343622,I bought CHZ when they announced Man City collab
1616343640,And got out at -14%
1616343663,Bought NXPS DENT and STMX and made back 5%
1616343668,But still big hit
1616343677,I put 4k in CHZ
1616343691,Any thoughts on todays pump?
1616343760,"Got 2 balls, none of them crystal"
1616343854,"@NotMatt Last 2 pumps were 120% and 220% respectively. Same group today. But it's always hard to tell when they will flatline and when they will crash, which is bound to happen. Still hoping for 100% today"
1616344032,Everybody using bots?
1616344036,Will be in #🎓post-grads-podium about 5 min before the pump
1616344052,Someone mentioned VIA as a possible prepump yesterdqy
1616344053,which pump group?
1616344072,Don’t know if anybody here used to do Bps pumps
1616344093,https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/804392911433236520/823046195227918336
1616344100,i used to
1616344107,WSB
1616344127,Did you also took part in this guys pump?
1616344153,keep it
1616344183,I joined the last 2 pumps of the group today and made cash. From the way things looked you were able to make good money even without a bot
1616344187,I use a bot though personally
1616344196,"yes, but ive exited after the first pump i participated"
1616344208,Which one?
1616344211,wsb
1616344227,I mean
1616344238,"The 2nd one was even better I should add. But this doesn say anything about today, could be even better or much worse"
1616344244,Do you remember the bps pumps?
1616344253,There was SKY
1616344254,yes
1616344257,Which was shit
1616344257,The 0.5 second ones?
1616344260,Too fast
1616344267,"ive done pnt, sky and another one that i dont remember"
1616344272,But there was one where i made bank
1616344278,they did that on purpose
1616344279,I can’t remember the coin
1616344282,"Sky was okay, but you needed to be fast"
1616344286,But i made so much
1616344305,I wanted to know how fast today’s pump gonna be
1616344308,the ones after Sky were all trash except Moeda or what's that shit coin called
1616344318,that did 70% or so
1616344320,(An estimate)
1616344333,I know we can’t predict the future
1616344335,Last 2 pumps of that group peaked after 30 seconds or so for me
1616344340,Woo
1616344343,I can tell you that much
1616344347,That’s a loooong time
1616344348,for me the VIB from BPS was the worst
1616344368,There was one where i made stupid money
1616344379,And with VIB i lost like 100$
1616344387,But it was fine
1616344389,Since it's a big group they do a trick of sorts and give out the pump signal delayed in every group slightly different. That way they ensure it wont crash after 5 seconds at least
1616344402,Cause i made like 2k with another pump
1616344407,Vib pumped right now
1616344413,What % increase you thinking today?
1616344432,"I think the absolute peak is 250%, but thats very optimistic"
1616344439,Im shooting for 100-150
1616344448,Is there I point where I should consider entering?
1616344451,is that with or without margin/
1616344452,"Hopefully 500%
Realisticly 100%tops"
1616344459,Like if i see +50%
1616344464,Should I risk it?
1616344493,"Honestly you either go in right at the start or you shouldnt risk it. Delayed entry has rarely worked out for me, unless you buy the dump and then ride a second wave"
1616344519,Yeah i mean at the start
1616344527,"Yeah, entering when its already 50% -100% is quite safe on big pumps"
1616344552,I only ever had success by buying possible candidate coins days in advance when they're cheap 😉
1616344577,"If it's 50% and you buy right then, it should still be safe. Last time it sorta took 10 seconds to get going, then went 50%, 100%, then another 10 seconds before mooning slowly to 200% which was pretty crazy"
1616344584,"I exited at 100% already, but kept watching"
1616344679,"@SeineJanie Yeah, planning to do that once I have some ""play"" cash lol"
1616344682,"Yes, last time their collaboration kept it going for a decent amount of time. Not one of these 10 seconds pump and dumps."
1616344688,I’ll take a look at the pump
1616344710,But I’m always scared that this guys dump in the first seconds
1616344715,Yeah its tricky to know the maximum hight. Sometimes it dips 30% before going higher. I remember last pump it went to 200% i quit at 180% and than it bounced up to nearly 300%
1616344724,"EVX dumping. I took lots of profit along the way, now I'm out. Don't think it's EVX today"
1616344736,Yeah there is usually an early dump when one of the admins sells early with his big profit
1616344744,Especially with their public growing
1616344746,but last 2 times it kept going after it
1616344760,The time were they shit on everybody is gonna come
1616344765,Let’s see
1616344772,I’m gonna buy some btc
1616344789,Just in case it looks good to join
1616344791,Oh yeah no doubt about it. I think they have 2-3 good pumps left in them before they go the way of BPS
1616344808,Maybe VIB ? Although it looks too obvious
1616344820,I mean they have literally no reason to dump straight away
1616344827,I'll just sit back and watch today
1616344841,Keep an eye on the podium 👀
1616344857,Aight
1616344861,But today should be good. All signs looking nice at least
1616344951,I love THETA btw
1616344962,4.5x for me
1616344967,So...where are the guesses? Cmoon guys its our weekly thing
1616344971,Hope it goes to 20/30$
1616345183,I hope thats a coin that I have 😹 😹
1616345232,What Sjoerd said
1616345246,Need 5 invites for podium access though...
1616345290,God damn
1616345322,No freebies huh
1616345347,"Quid pro quo. Benefit the server, benefit yourself."
1616345370,Shilling 4 people to join server.heh
1616345381,When is the pump?
1616345387,11min
1616345389,10 min
1616345403,That means 5 mins to be pumped
1616345410,"It’s awesome man, congrats on your money so far, it’ll just keep going up from here 🙏🏻"
1616345451,"If you are Sophomore or higher, be sure to click on the red chad coin emoji in #🔴post-grads-podium-ping to get pinged for post grad podium calls!"
1616345526,How do you become a post grad?
1616345529,Just curious
1616345536,Invites
1616345540,Shit ton of them
1616345550,Or send feet pics
1616345551,I think knowledge and contribution
1616345555,Hmmm bcd looks weird
1616345563,post grad is being one of the members who are the most helpful to the whole community
1616345592,Ok thanks
1616345597,I’m Finaly in to read “calls” 🙂
1616345601,"You give consistent good calls which is more than ""Buy XXX just because."" Good TA for entry points or sharing FA research, something like that"
1616345611,Hmmm bcd fishy indeed
1616345631,Very much so
1616345683,I put a tenner just in case
1616345701,"the bitcoin forks are going to have a rough time going forward.  they all want to realize their own interpretation of what it should be, yet there are other coins out there that are better at it all the same."
1616346045,Collab pump postponed 😦
1616346050,:kekw:
1616346053,lmao
1616346057,lol
1616346058,LOL
1616346059,BPS rebranded
1616346061,Yes something spooked them
1616346061,😹 😹 😹 😹
1616346068,hahahahahaha
1616346071,qlc was probably right then
1616346072,Evx fail?
1616346076,look at nav tanking
1616346082,someone was doing MDA too
1616346082,BS message about@protecting their members
1616346082,they're all tanking!
1616346084,"Alright @SeineJanie, I finally got KuCoin set up and am balls deep in some LUKSO"
1616346085,Smh. What a fail
1616346096,$MDA was the coin
1616346099,dicks
1616346105,-100% already
1616346109,Lol $5 lost
1616346116,I guess they learnt from their ideals lol
1616346119,It was 1000% qlc
1616346120,Jeez
1616346131,lol
1616346136,I hope QLC has some good news the next days
1616346140,$MDA check chart
1616346142,I am holding it
1616346221,How much?
1616346226,Many BTC?
1616346232,920 dollar :p
1616346234,i sold qlc instantly
1616346242,It dropped 😦
1616346245,I was too slow
1616346247,no loss
1616346259,It wasn’t an horrible drop tho
1616346265,yeah not for qlc
1616346270,but others tanked quite hard
1616346274,How much you lost?
1616346277,30$?
1616346283,#skycoin pumpp ?
1616346291,I will just sell it
1616346299,No point in holding :p
1616346330,NAV literally halved
1616346382,That sounds like paper hands. Im still diamond handing MLK for the second wave /s
1616346404,I am the definition off paper hands :p
1616346454,Oh for sure. Its prob a smart play tbh. Holding pump coins is usually more trouble than its worth. I was just being ironic although its hard to convey that in text
1616346474,Damn I missed the Ankr second wave
1616346733,i would suggest to buy NAV and sell a few hours later
1616346750,This is better than pump lol
1616346818,"Look at the 1 day chart, it's slowly going up. Hold and set sell 1% above buy price"
1616346934,seeing big increase in dent
1616346957,what chart are you looking at
1616346966,"bought at the dip, then saw this haha"
1616346986,
1616346996,i mean what time frame
1616347003,live
1616347013,15 min?
1616347019,time
1616347098,"lmao, never mind."
1616347146,MDA hit a 2 month low 😂
1616347155,God these pumps produce such predictable patterns
1616347177,"Yeah
Should give 30-60% imo"
1616347264,what are you thinking? 0.000015-.00002?
1616347286,Lol yep that's crazy
1616347320,I was thinking 0.000018.
1616347339,was nav pumped to this price or just shit the bed?
1616347350,Was a pre pump
1616347402,There was also a lot of speculation around $NAV so was probably pre-pumped
1616347409,"Speculation on pump coins is a consistent way to make money, it's probably how they make most of their money tbh"
1616347421,"whats the difference between a pump and prepump? I get the suffix, so it just the size of the firstcomers?"
1616347430,They probably figured they made enough on whatever coin they were going to pump and just dumped it
1616347467,'pre' means before. It's the admins of the pump(and people speculating) accumulating the coin before the pump. The pump is the actual pump itself at  :00
1616347468,NAV 100% gain since Friday... what more do you need
1616347501,pumps are litterally you handing the admins money
1616347511,its the admins taking your money
1616347512,I keep locking myself in short to mid positions saying that I'll hold some BTC till friday morning to buy into pumpy coins
1616347513,rather

1616347572,:kekw: :simp: :virgin:
1616347591,were all simping for admin.
1616347592,damn
1616347755,I’m just looking for the coins that are *not* getting pumped :kekw:
1616347854,"If there's a ranking system based on how many people you invite, you're simping for admins..."
1616347898,lol
1616347951,NKN is not pumping lol as im stuck in red with it
1616347987,NKN is slowly declining
1616348073,Depends which timeframe you're looking at. 1Day shows an average increase
1616348091,i guess ill sale wth small loss.. before its big loss lol
1616348102,would need to make up loss with something else.
1616348132,unless someone think holding it will be worth it:)
1616348140,how are you trading?
1616348147,"long term, position, or day?"
1616348156,no strategy really.
1616348164,Oh boy
1616348164,mostly looking to buy and leave it sale later.
1616348169,Look at 1 day chart. You may not need to sell for loss
1616348174,I generally sell 25% if something goes on the rise
1616348178,sometimes  just buy and sale.
1616348187,Then reinvest that somewhere else

1616352156,Started from the bottom now we're here
1616352165,Put all on DENT
1616352197,Is that a handle forming on a cup? ⚓
1616352214,I needed you but you were M. I. A @Cryptoknight so I sold
1616352547,What??? Why didn't you tag me? I'm on a enj friendly server mostly now
1616352573,I'm still in 100%
1616352603,A snake penis
1616352616,What are the predictions there?
1616352626,Can I join that server or? :p
1616352643,Are u in enj?
1616352660,Predictions are the same as before. $10 before the end of april
1616352690,Only difference is that instead of this fall happening after$4 it happened before.
1616352704,@kittiewitty
1616352781,Yes I am in ENJ
1616352849,Sub to therealmrcrypto on twitch. Ull get access to his discord. We're al there mostly
1616352858,@kittiewitty
1616352873,Also now maybe xelos server
1616352880,I might buy later
1616352891,Too late to buy low
1616352903,Unless it falls again like in the next few hours
1616352909,Last time I bought at 2.6
1616352912,So it's not late
1616352918,Lol
1616352921,But I recovered the money on dent
1616352924,Its still *4 to 10 :p
1616352926,That was way too high
1616352938,Dent saved me
1616352943,Wdym
1616352969,If it's 10 by the end of April I got time to profit
1616352971,If the predictions are 10 dollar
1616352979,"Oh,no. Thing accelerated on enjins side."
1616353041,"It's a prediction. Daz has it right every single time, but still it's a prediction"
1616353160,Sold this morning. And then wasn’t sure it was time to join back. And now it’s probably too late. Unless to buy for long term
1616353197,And is that going to get pushed back a couple of days everytime BTC dips as the past predictions? 😏
1616353337,What’s ur dent expectations price wise ?:)
1616353402,Expectations are made to let you down
1616353409,No expectations
1616353413,Casino style
1616353430,JK
1616353459,It worked to recover and profit from the ENJ failure
1616353460,Maybe. That's why it's called a PREDICTION. lol. Otherwise it would be called a shill.
1616353497,"Anyways, I'm all out of ENJ now and into ELF."
1616353502,Enj failure? Lol. Stop fomoing into shit.
1616353520,I mean that it failed for me
1616353527,"Dude. You are one of the few on this group that didn't fomo into it. Why ur out, I don't understand."
1616353533,Not that ENJ is a failure
1616353562,And I don't understand why you put ENJ on a gold plate
1616353585,I'm 100% still in enj. Lol. I believe in it more than I believe in btc
1616353594,Why?
1616353596,I mean 100% of my portfolio
1616353603,what can i say? stop losses 🤷🏼‍♂️
1616353608,Cause I see the future
1616353615,Ouch.
1616353616,I believe in ELF. Because ELF is German for eleven and that's where I see this coin going. 11 €
1616353648,That isnt FOMO btw. FOMO = Fear of Missing Out
1616353654,What if it is elf as in fairy and its value only exists in people's minds? 😦
1616353670,You dont FOMO out of a position. You only FOMO into a position
1616353672,Hold onto that.my German clients are one of the key private investors. These guys are big. Decendants of Nazis turned good. Lots of power
1616353676,Caught that rare no gainer in my list
1616353695,Iv seen that only once on my futures
1616353702,Spot here
1616353704,You can also fomo out of a position when you sell it to secure some gains and then it moons right after
1616353710,It was only there for a few seconds
1616353718,Haha. I know. But u exit coins u fomo into because u never believed in them. I was this person once.
1616353741,No. That's called fml
1616353775,"I like to quote a wise woman here: ""Loyalty to gains, not coins!"" https://discord.com/channels/794945757886414848/813204087297933312/822952661191098439"
1616353797,Isnt that just securing gains? You aren’t fearful of missing out of anything. You are just fearful of losing profit which fits more FUD
1616353816,Love is blind
1616353845,Fear of the uncertainty and doubt. Which is why you get out of a position
1616353876,U do realise that I learnt not to fomo into shit from you right?
1616353902,You can believe in a coin short term and still get out.
1616353926,Yeah... but ... how is that related to the quote?
1616353929,You are fearful of missing out on your gains in case the assets drop
1616353940,It's not.im just saying thanks
1616353945,"ah, okay!"
1616353949,you're very welcome
1616353958,Which fits more of FUD because you are uncertain it will go further
1616353969,I guess fomo and fud seem to be overlapping concepts
1616353975,Jeremy gts
1616353983,FOMO fits more in the buying. FUD fits more in the selling
1616353990,I don't know what fud is
1616354002,Fear uncertainty and doubt
1616354009,"Fud Ruckers, it's a burger spot"
1616354022,Oh fuck that shit
1616354047,Almost wasnt anymore. They closed permanently cause of covid. Only recently decided to nix the permanent part and reopen
1616354081,"Good, I like that place. Think they closed the one in Santa Monica I used to go to"
1616354103,"I'm talking about believing in a coins philosophy and use case, not growth potential"
1616354141,Why are they closing places? What happened to Zomato?
1616354171,any news today? did anyone got into a pump or a good futures move or sum
1616354178,"Yes but at the end of the day, we are all trading to make money. If the coin’s project doesnt line up with its growth potential then its a bad trade all around"
1616354202,I sold my EVX pre-pump at +100%
1616354263,"If you wanted to believe in a project instead of just make profits on it, you would 100% stake in it instead of spot buying. Im not seeing anyone who is 100% staking ENJ"
1616354398,DENT is really doing his thing today.. didn’t believe he could go back up after the fall
1616354401,Dent is going up!!
1616354418,yup... I got 33% already on it
1616354420,"Aka everyone is in it for the money at the end of the day. I dont see a future for ENJ long term. I made short term profits from it and got out. Its not a project I believe in and I don’t believe in any project enough to not be aiming for profits and just be aiming to support the project but if you want to support ENJ, you stake instead."
1616354435,Just got some. The question what would it reach 🙂
1616354460,Whoa what's going on w ONE? Something get announced?
1616354464,Be cautious
1616354510,It could go high but it could also go down 20% in no time
1616354525,i would not buy dent now
1616354528,I wouldn’t have bought now
1616354558,Hope it turns out good for you
1616354559,i been buying dips all day and selling it gonna drop soon
1616354572,Yeah I’m pretty liquid
1616354578,I do believe in a drop
1616354587,I got dent 0.006700 🙂
1616354599,"enj looking good, but don't forget... papa bitcoin is always watching and ready to strike when you least expect it. keep btc tab always opened and monitor it"

1616354623,I’m in at 0.0053
1616354634,On it. 0.0072 sale order
1616354645,I bought yesterday at 0.0058 and after it reached like 0.007 I didn’t sell
1616354648,Might not even reach that
1616354653,I sold it at 0.0063
1616354667,Cause i was being greedy
1616354667,Are you back in it mate? @NotMatt
1616354671,Nope
1616354676,"Not gonna take any out, just gonna let it rise and hope for the best"

1616354712,It’s 30£
1616354724,Doesn’t change much even if it drops
1616354744,Ye
1616354756,I never buy 30$ of something
1616354772,I usually throw 100$ on shitcoins that i plan to hold
1616354783,It’s pumping. Lol dent I am watching u.  Thank u for a dent guys 🙂
1616354794,i just bought this dip on troy

1616355344,Ada has an listening coming
1616355348,"Oh boy finally, wanted to speak to someone about that"
1616355361,"Been researching it a bit recently, what did you get in at? @NotMatt"
1616355363,Yeah ive been looking at pundi aswell
1616355405,Idk.. but I put in 100$ and i have 774$ now

1616355450,"Jeez, so probably around $0.001 then"
1616355465,Sold my dend 0.0074 with 20£ profit. Thabk u guys! And good luck to those who holding
1616355472,"Fuck, PUNDIX sounds like a really good project but I don’t know if it’s too late to enter"
1616355513,"Obv not but, idk I’m mixed on it rn"
1616355525,Think I’m gonna research it more and decide later
1616355582,Honestly I don’t even know why I bought PUNDI 😂
1616355586,do u guys think HODL some $BRJR is a good idea ?? came out yesterday its a 5% Burn DeFi but im not sure rn
1616355599,Worked out though hahahaha
1616355607,Yeah 😂
1616355610,Definitely
1616355796,On the question whether or not you should buy it now.. buy if you plan to hodl.. I wouldn’t risk it short term.. it could sideways imo
1616355960,I always buy to hodl my guy :p
1616356166,@SeineJanie  how has the tradingview alert thingy been doing?
1616356485,Anyone holding ADA?
1616356679,Hello guys
1616356683,"How does ranking
 work on coinmarketcap.com? Is it in descending order by decreasing marcetcap? If so, then why isnt ECOMI with 1billion mcap on page one?"
1616356694,I do
1616356702,Expectations?
1616356720,3-5$ by the end of the year
1616356754,Buy opportunity rn ?
1616356781,Listing is tomorrow so
1616356799,In my opinion everything around 1USd   It will get to 3$ so even if u pay 1.50 still 100% profit plus staking
1616356819,"ADA, NPXS, MBL"
1616356826,What listing ?
1616356832,Why don't I hear anything about Chainlink
1616356839,Coineal I think
1616356863,Should spike price then but I’d not expect double. Maybe 15-20%
1616356869,Chainlink has something for end of month
1616356875,Q1 whatever that means
1616356962,What listing was it? Haven’t paid enough attention lmao
1616356983,Coineal
1616357140,"If the coinbase listing didn’t have an insane bump in price, dunno how big coineal will have"
1616357152,True
1616357163,So is anyone a fan of Chainlink
1616357167,No one talks about it
1616357228,FOMO on DENT right now but don’t want to jump on at peak
1616357287,What are the crypto to hold?
1616357381,Im looking for coins to hold atleast 1 month
1616357516,Maybe Tron
1616357767,OCEAN!
1616357783,LYXe
1616357789,I will keep shilling:kekw:
1616357903,why?
1616357928,Because if you buy enough OCEAN the Netherlands won’t get flooded
1616357963,"But, the opposite will happen when he gets his OCEAN delivered and then it gets stuck on the wrong side of the dyke 😦"
1616357967,Hallo nederlanders :kekw:
1616357975,"rip, gonna find out what the dutch stock index is and short it right away"
1616358004,Better put a call on global warming then
1616358010,Data related project. Already really good partnerships. Something that has a lot of potential for future adoption.
1616358019,Stmx Trx Neo or Ada which should I get?
1616358022,Dent is on crack man
1616358023,ROI of 2 degrees per decade
1616358041,Oh dent is in the binance top gainers
1616358163,Partnerships with Dubai and Singapore
1616358173,and much more bigger companieas
1616358305,Good call. Shame I sold out too early
1616358484,"@Morkle hey, why does hnt have a massive spike down to 2$!!?"
1616358524,I don't see it. What exchange?
1616358595,What is a polybridge network?
1616358601,yeah me neither

1616358894,Cool idea guys 👍🏻
1616358918,Anyone owner of ZIL?
1616358928,Guess who got themselves some XRP :p
1616358951,I think you must add time term. @Alanox
1616358965,Had xrp since 0.407 😘
1616358983,"Some alerts will include that, but always expect around a week or so."
1616358998,"Okay, thank you"
1616359019,Legendary :p
1616359062,"OK, you mean we should go 200x long on XRP ✅"
1616359099,Im already 500x using money I took out from a 5th mortgage. Get on my level
1616359141,"Wow thats a good idea :kekw: :kekw: 

*disclaimer: sarcasm*"
1616359162,"what does this mean ""- Driven by Artificial Intelligence"" more specifically?"
1616359165,"If you aren’t taking out monumental debt on gambler level leverage, are you even trying to make money"
1616359167,for bot
1616359180,Disclaimer: also sarcasm
1616359182,Skynet
1616359215,yeah
1616359246,It sure is. I got in it late but I’m happy I’m in it. HODL
1616359250,this means i cant send over BSC network right?
1616359251,They put a bunch of data into a neural network and then that does something and then something comes out but nobody knows exactly why 😄
1616359273,a poop ?
1616359385,Im looking at ZIL STMX and XRP any opinions if im too soon to hop in these?
1616359475,"I have said before and will say again, if i ever were the sort to have a HODL bag, XRP would be in it"
1616359492,Thanks
1616359576,"https://coinlist.co/rly
hows this look ?"
1616359598,"to me looks eh, but maybe theres something im missing"
1616359602,I am counting on ZIL too
1616359622,It is an active token not an ico
1616359623,I am invested in ZIL
1616359638,Sale is for further coin distribution
1616359664,Im thinking zil will retest 0.15 and rocket then
1616359692,I suggest doing some research regarding STMX.. i know it looks good since it’s been growing a lot but there probably are chances of getting burnt there
1616359722,so it is
1616359759,trading 101 - if its already overheated stay out
1616359797,unless ur really good at momentum trading
1616359808,emphasis on really
1616359813,All that price to be determined... like boson 0.75 minimum bid but who gives more gets the lot. I’ve registered for Boson but not sure I’ll get some as top price I’m ready to pay is  1$.
1616359855,"yeah this means tight stop losses and watching the vol and money flow in the 3min chart like a crackhead, no thanks"
1616359878,pretty much
1616359882,some ppl can do it
1616359886,"hey grads, just a short question or suggestion or something along those lines please 🙂   the XRP call in signal bar channel, can u please tell us now and also maybe include in there the time frame you are expecting that 0.6-0.7 range happening ? few hours ? days ? weeks ?"
1616359925,"@MeNtisH Alan said about a week or so, he also said that some future calls will include time frames :p"
1616359925,Notice that Swiss has disappeared ? I think the AI is him stuck in a box and fed sandwiches if he calls correctly
1616360028,"@David R. alright, thanks bro"
1616360045,"Thank Alan, the absolute unit"
1616360080,"thank you, thank you alan, and thank you grads, u are doing a very good thing for your members."
1616360101,🤣🤣😭
1616360131,He making money while and watching us lol
1616360137,DYOR for sure but that call could be a single day or maybe 48hours max
1616360164,No Ada?
1616360187,to be honest i am absolute nub in all this so i mostly just go blindly on your beautiful calls @Sausage Destroyer
1616360216,"if I had a HODL bag, it would have BTC, ADA, NANO, ETH, XRP"
1616360231,noooooooooo
1616360238,"you have not failed me even once so far, except underestimating the power of ENJ 😄 which is cool it still went up as u said, it just went way up :))))"
1616360240,Nano is v undervalued I think
1616360315,Descending triangle though
1616360337,"I'm not religious but the hindu side of my family, my Aaji there (gran) said I had the blessing of/manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) because where I go I take financial blessings with me"
1616360348,The last 'hurrah' turned into a last 'heureka'
1616360367,haha yes 😄
1616360383,"Actually it would be good to have a list of holds from the community. I have the bad tendency to invest in all promising projects, and get distracted from the core ones"
1616360427,"ENJ was supposed to be a standard swing trade call for me, turned into a shitty abusive marriage"
1616360456,Like a tinder date!
1616360487,"and i would like a note if it would be a pleasure rather then a harrassment on a opinion on VITE, as i have been following it for the last 1-2 weeks, and it made some very nice moves, then died out for 2-3-4-5 days, and now seems to be waking up again, from the looks of its chart etc can u make some kind of a call on what are its next plans in the next 1-2-3-7 days ?"
1616360489,"Like someone said before: bearish Sunday, bullish week"
1616360499,$2M worth of ENJ just spiked 5 minutes ago
1616360522,What are you talking about?! My pf is up 5% 2day 😉
1616360549,5% for me is bearish dk about you
1616360561,Stmx bullish or does it need to rest a while?
1616360561,Let's pray to Lakshmi
1616360637,"at this point whatever tickles your bum, after my bubble tea fiasco, i need all"
1616360714,Who did that endeavour bless financially?
1616360733,No one here
1616360740,Otherwise wouldn't be here
1616360754,Could anyone help me understand this cycles bull run - like how do we know the bull run has started/ finished etc. 🤔
1616360770,Or is it generally a guessing game
1616360785,Yay. Not -700% anymore :kekw: :kekw:
1616360793,literally all my dumbass ex-partners
1616360797,Dont forget VET

1616360942,"you're still only third in line, first is the trader I live with/is my boyfriend - in this discord too actually, @chrisOG  then second is Idris Elba, then you."

1616360975,"LUNA looks tired, which is not surprising after that climb."
1616360979,Imma go back to trying to make money I guess 😪
1616360982,Cruel world
1616360992,Luckily I am the real Idris Elba so Chris better keep his romance game strong
1616361006,Waiting for the dip to get in
1616361022,ORN WTF

1616361037,74$ more to recover
1616361041,😁
1616361132,"And Kayne ""predicted"" it ... 🤪"
1616361133,"we both are, we both got payrises around same time in our jobs, hefty ones too, plus we both trade and learned from each other - I learned swing strats from him after I taught him foundational stuff"
1616361185,Don't need to justify boo
1616361238,wooow all 3 of us could be so great
1616361307,someone bring kanye back
1616361312,for his great ORN work
1616361324,dude may sound and act dumb
1616361331,but theres something working in his lil brain
1616361356,"@That one belgian super cunt it's goingggg, we're gonna be freeeeee soooooon!!!!"
1616361365,FREEDOM
1616361367,IS COMING
1616361377,"To apply Kayne's logic to his own call: ORN is boring, only pumped 20%. I made 100% on EVX today 🙄"
1616361427,"Looks bullish to me! Although the price has gone up since it was created, technically - so how do we say ‘well this is when the bull market started’ or is it merely guessing dependent on the way BTC behaves? And I assume if we see a HUGE drop with BTC with no sign of positive price improvements, could we say that we’re in a bear market (I think that’s the correct terminology - the opposite to bull)"
1616361501,@felguerr are you 100% sure that there are no typos in your list of crypto-tweeters to follow? 🤨
1616361547,"tbf, it spiked, too out my take profit and is dumping down again - may haver some juice still but im out now"
1616361586,ENJ going wild
1616361641,I'm out :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

1616361680,then imma hurt my left toe
1616361794,already out of enj?
1616361841,"Well, these are certainly bear markets:
https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-chart-2014-and-2018-compared-2.jpg"
1616361888,"@David R. How to find out when it's time to get out and not just a minor correction (see bull trap in Jan 2018 which absolutely caught me), that's another question"
1616361932,@Morkle you think hnt has potential to pass its ATH in the next day or 2?!?!
1616362482,ENJ new ATH today!!!
1616362487,(i hope)
1616362507,I will do thanks man!
1616362527,"Any minute now, since I am out"
1616362556,Feel bad for you man.
1616362580,"I shorted ENJ at 2,49 so you can be 100% it's going to moon now. You're welcome. 😄"
1616362610,I bought like 100$ worth of Doge. All you doge haters are welcome too (cause it fell almost immediately)!
1616362632,2.5!!
1616362650,"Also, Disclaimer: Please dont FOMO into it now."
1616362665,"I repeat, DO NOT buy ENJ (unles you believe). Leave that to us."
1616362686,ENJ or ETH?
1616362707,WTF! ETH is going to 2.5? Nice! I think i'll sell my ENJ for a tiny bit
1616362718,Someone in stmx?
1616362765,"2.5k, ya"
1616362805,Not before i sell 50% of my ENJ at $4to FINALLY make my portfoio diverse as you advise.
1616362869,when u think its hittin 2.5
1616362875,Already is
1616362888,its only 40% away
1616362914,talking about eth btw
1616362937,So stmx buy opportunity or?
1616362977,probs not
1616363564,ENJ GOOOOO MAKE MY BET PAY OFF YOU FUCKING SHIT COIIIIIIIN
1616363671,SLP STONKING
1616363778,nav :D
1616364398,Is there a good tool/site out there where you can compare the charts of different coins by laying them on top of each other?
1616364869,Hey everyone what are you toughts on sparta
1616364980,"i am curious about the signal-bar channel,   the bot is posting them but who is ACTUALY posting them ? any of the grads ? all of them having a discussion about the safest calls ? or something else entirely ?"
1616365167,^^
1616365178,always good call
1616365405,"@SeineJanie how you finding UCTS? I got my free 10 day trial so messing about with settings etc. 
Are you trialing the Trendfinder one too? That looks good - 6 timeframes in one view etc."
1616365414,EGL my personal hero today lol thank u!
1616365443,@Dani_tzt what's your next call ;)
1616365459,"Not the post grads; however you can surely validate the signals yourself before entering them. Data is provided by the AI, and the calls are made manually to ensure they're in the best case scenarios. As always, DYOR."
1616365487,"Dego, portfolio killer atm"
1616365493,Still going for $40
1616365542,"@Nuvo oh so its automated, i thought some of our higher ranks were actualy posting them."
1616365611,"Not actually automated. Before the signal is given, it's vetted so that it's within the potential buy/sell zones."
1616365744,"yea thats good, thats very good."
1616367186,dego slaughtered me lmao
1616367548,I'm still up
1616367560,When I first called it :p
1616367676,what bet
1616367760,the bet of him going mega negative in the margin
1616367765,and adding more to the margin to survive
1616368308,
1616368312,Hey big spender
1616368322,(my first futures)
1616368335,Free $2 from KuCoin
1616368389,Where Lambo?
1616368762,Around the corner. You just need 50 cents more
1616369219,is there like a pastebin or something of all of the futures coins on binance?
1616369240,needing to alt tab and click the drop down and scroll very arduous
1616369426,(im inputting all of the coins there for an excel thing)
1616370362,You're good now. Sleep in peace.
1616370397,"Also, dont sell on the top. Put a stop loss."
1616370432,A stop loss at a target profit under current price. We think its making its run today
1616370803,"You are welcome to give your opinion on things but you can't tell people to sell or not to sell. You are able to say ""if I was you I wouldnt do x..."" ""I wouldnt recommend x. Id recommend doing x instead"". We don't tell people to buy or to sell or to hold around here. It doesn't support the DYOR environment that we are trying to have here"
1616370868,Jeremy don't worry no one trusts an ENJ boot licker
1616370869,"This also is better for ***YOU*** as well.  Telling people to do things can make you responsible 

Edited for easier understanding"
1616370918,"Regardless if anyone trust or doesnt trust a person, this is helpful for new people who haven't been around long enough to figure out other's TA accuracy"
1616370938,gettin kinda nervous about this usdt transaction that has not been processed yet :|
1616370990,I think no one here trusts the other without making a bit of research
1616371021,its been 3 hrs 🤔
1616371032,Check the values raven
1616371069,A lot of people come here after getting burned from pumps. These type of people are normally too trusting to begin with; Regardless its good to cut out signal type talking when they start so we can encourage DYOR more 🙂
1616371084,the values?
1616371099,What kind of transaction are you talking about?
1616371103,A deposit?
1616371123,agree with this
1616371139,transfew
1616371143,tansfer
1616371147,screw spelling
1616371167,from binance to coinlist
1616371173,i know their shit been actin funky lately
1616371243,"The other day I made a deposit sepa in binance that normally tooks like 10, 15 minutes and it took like 4 hours"
1616371253,It was in a weekend
1616371288,"oh now its saying that deposits are just disabled atm, last time i checked they still had everything"
1616371297,better fuckin be there after they fix their shit
1616371298,or ima actually lose it
1616371311,I almost got liquidated last time
1616371339,as long as its there in time for me to get my cspr
1616371342,then i wont have a problem
1616371377,i think im seeing MANY people here risking too much with futures
1616371440,oh btw
1616371491,"we can delete the channels dedicated to the ping notifs for post grad and signal bar, we can just enable or disable notifications for all messages in those specific channels"
1616371504,"rather than like, having 2 whole channels"
1616371506,Jeremy and his ETH saga got everyone hooked on futures like it was meth
1616371531,that and the ppl making mad gainz from enj futures
1616371542,I gave my risk management speeches 🤷‍♂️
1616371545,+600% in a few hrs never forget
1616371564,I mean who wouldn’t trust someone who’s holding MLK he’s committed
1616371575,Hey the second wave is coming
1616371576,Trust
1616371580,/s
1616371600,Jeremy don't say that
1616371605,"Please, let's not talk about the cursed currency 😦"
1616371622,It should come but we never know
1616371633,waiting for the second coming?
1616371636,I'm gonna know. Im watching every day
1616371653,I even have cookies ready for this MLK second wave
1616371662,"You just go against yourself Jeremy, take your own advices"
1616371705,"not like me who got out of futures after my bad move at ETH, could have doubled and got to 0% profits"
1616371706,Of course not
1616371743,I'm faithful to Ada 😹 😹
1616371755,Futures are difficult to gage tbh especially at high leverage. Im actually going for long term futures nowadays
1616371761,2-4x leverage for a few months
1616371788,no more 10-12x leverage for me even though those were the good old days
1616371789,im going to chill for a long time
1616371797,just spot
1616371799,safe bets
1616371801,I just do spot
1616371823,Honestly 2-4x is safe enough for most long term trades so I am cool doing a little bit of leverage on what I trust
1616371825,Futures are way too adictive
1616371841,really is addictive
1616371851,my problrm atm
1616371857,is that i can make 9 good spot trades in a row
1616371859,and be like ok
1616371861,futures time
1616371862,Made like 2k in a day
1616371868,and almost IMMEDAITELY get liquidated
1616371876,"BTC taking a shit, brace yourselves"
1616371885,Next day liquidates
1616371885,hot
1616371899,It's way too risky
1616371913,sounds like shorting time
1616371922,Spot seems more to a piggie bank
1616371932,Buy and don't think about it for a while
1616371995,How big is the deuce?
1616372017,approximately a 2% retrace
1616372028,"Don't worry, better days will come"
1616372115,is this a 125x short signal
1616372119,im kidding pls dont shoot me
1616372143,"Imma break off your ass, shit in it, then beat you with it like it's a hospital bedpan"
1616372166,youll have to ask my girl for permission for that kinky shit first
1616372246,not if your girl is her girl afterwards 👀
1616372266,i see this as an absolute win
1616372358,"Fair enough, but i never asked him to not sell. I said instead of selling, put a stop loss target under the sell target so he doesnt lose anymore but can gain from more gain he may not anticipate."
1616372420,"i think it was more the language choice.
""dont do this, do this"""
1616372429,"rather than, ""i think you should do this instead of this"""
1616372493,why is MFT having a seizure in the 15min chart
1616372504,Japan is dumping BTC
1616372539,"it gets nervous, maybe stop looking at it so intensely 👀"
1616372653,Didn't buy one and now it's officially 10x'd
1616372660,😔
1616372753,"""Also, dont sell on the top. Put a stop loss."""
1616372769,"You said ""dont sell"". This is what I am addressing"
1616372799,you aren't allowed to say do or do not. You are only allowed to give your own opinion on the matter
1616372868,"oh, can i ask how the fabled chadcoin is coming along?"
1616372888,Thats above my paygrade 🤷‍♂️
1616373490,oh no
1616373494,once more I robbed my self with ENJ
1616373509,this time by setting my TP to conservatively :kekw:
1616373530,finally I figured out that the way to make money with ENJ is shorting it for all the little itæs worth :kekw:
1616373570,"missed the low by 0,02"
1616373592,Humm im wondering if I cashout tonight or not 😂
1616373595,it kinda is though :kekw:
1616373610,💀
1616374512,@Jeremyfto have you seen ETH this evening bossman?
1616374542,I would like to take a moment to appreciate how accurately CD has predicted that 2% BTC dump.
1616374602,"I'm starting to suspect that her day job is in wealth management and she didn't predict a dump, but warned us of a dump she caused."
1616374623,I have. Its still chilling between its 1700-1900$ range. Sure this is a large range but its not doing anything crazy IMO
1616374624,She _is_ BTC 😮
1616374636,"oi, watch your moth"
1616374659,If it drops below 1700 then ill be hard watching it
1616374666,"Ah, didn’t know it was that large of a gap, interesting stuff :p"
1616374671,Someone predicted it’ll go to 1630
1616374681,
1616374685,I dont own any atm so that would be cool if it did
1616374689,I could get back in
1616374692,You were saying?
1616374813,This is why I corrected him when he said “dont sell at the top”... I would be pissed as fuck if I was new to trading and that was info I took advantage of instead of doing my own research
1616374871,Saying do or do not instead of giving opinions linked with DYOR is dangerous to new traders. This is by far the biggest point I was making
1616374927,"I started making money off ENJ by shorting it each time it approaches a wall or a new ""high"" and when BTC takes a dive :kekw:"
1616374940,Works much better than cutting myself with diamond hands
1616374946,That actually sounds like fun!
1616374968,Its DND night so no trading for me tonight
1616375027,Dego struggling now I thought NFT was a hype?
1616375028,I have such a hate for btc. Every single coin being dependent on how that cunt is doing is so fucking dumb
1616375030,😭

1616375146,https://tenor.com/view/xrp-rekt-sec-ripple-hfsp-gif-19834224
1616375277,Once more I have underestimated the shittyness of the performance of ENJ
1616375287,I could have made so much more with this short :kekw:
1616375602,I just want 2.59 again so i can exit this dumb coin 😫
1616375681,Do you get your margin money back if you don’t make a loss? Sorry for the silly question
1616375742,"you're having so much trouble with that how about I do a quick analysis on it, it hurts me to sit here watching you struggle"
1616375744,Afaik yes. If you sell at a profit your margin isnt depleted so you get it back
1616375765,Shut up
1616375770,We know. Once is enough
1616375781,"That’s good news at least, hold on man<3"
1616375796,An analysis will probably hurt but sure mistress
1616375827,!warn @Mimikuuz Want profit Shut The/Fuck Up🚀
1616375827,
1616376055,Hang in there ada
1616376070,real sorry man but heres the ENJ analysis.
1616376077,
1616376093,27th of this month is make or break day approximately
1616376095,Though tby i want to close it and start a higher leverage long on it. Since ada isnt a shitcoin
1616376108,Estimated low?
1616376120,2 dollar ish
1616376192,Technically fine liq is 1.87 so i can hang on until the trend changes. We need a btc pump and new ATH high to make it go up and up and bring in new fomo
1616376209,Or atleast hold on til 9th of april when they launch jumpnet
1616376280,"this kind of flag, stastically, falls below quite a bit at the end, and then either keeps going down or rallies up a little/hold steady at that point - if that co-oncides with FA stuff then great, if not then you will get liq"
1616376364,:dababy: and then i hunt daz and knight :dababy:
1616376423,Following the downtrend on ENJ I’ve left my positions today when touched 0.0093bnb
1616377211,Time to go back to pump and dump groups put on beex and pray
1616377293,:kekw: papa dominus i need you
1616377793,storj mooning xd
1616379728,Guyss I invested in SPH last night. I'm up 2x in one night! It is absolutely a 100x gem.
1616379750,10x seems pretty easy at this point... 😅 get on the rise before it's too late...
1616379836,It's called Sheridan Universe.. SPH it's on LA Token and uniswap
1616379892,"lmao shills never change, do they?"
1616379919,Nah I'm just excited for having found my first 100x gem on my own😂
1616379941,And imnpositive it's going to explode. Right now market cap is only at 6mil.
1616380008,And yeah I'm not shilling..  trust me. I'm just a new crypto trader learning in this group for the past month.
1616380028,We don’t Fomo here. That’s against the rules. This is your one warning￼
1616380040,i'd imagine shilling is still discouraged here.  instead explain **why** you see potential in it.  do everybody a favor
1616380044,Oh! Sorry my bad. I didn't know that.
1616380056,Oh alright got it!
1616380241,Well for starters! It is under the field of AR and VR... the token SPH has got a very unique use case. And I feel it could be better than decentraland.
1616380307,"I'm learning to read etherscan for coins... right now. Less than 5% tokens in circulation. 92% of the 5% is owned by investors. And market caps at 6mil. It's use cases is just becoming popular now by Twitter and word of mouth and YouTube. Imo, I feel it will explode very soon! Do check it out and let me know your thoughts as well :)"

1616380771,So they do ads and more in VR and AR.
1616381761,oxt play?
1616382088,any thoughts on btc?
1616382659,Ads no! It's more of AR and VR. But in live physical space.
1616382708,They've made a grid on the entire world map and they sell places on the virtual space... essentially a place you buy physically would be different but on the app with you VR headset. The place you purchase would be more different
1616383641,there should be a signal for xlm
1616383661,calculations led by other calculations its retesting .6 😆

1616396768,What to do next 🤔
1616396822,STMX futures 😂
1616396882,Why stop there? Kim Il Sung died in 1994 and is still in office as president of North Korea. :kekw:
1616396968,There are no futures on stmx
1616397007,There are
1616397014,Just listed
1616397042,Binance trying to finesse their customers
1616397484,buy sxp from support sell it from resistance
1616397498,buy from 3.87 sell from 3.95
1616397500,easy
1616397508,do this 3 times and get yourself a good burger
1616397709,Did they get added?
1616397995,Yes
1616398009,It started going sideways
1616398012,Binance or other market?
1616398016,Binance
1616398041,Hmm. Hopefully stmx can get itself to 7-8c again.
1616398042,I’d probably get in a long if it drops to .056
1616398055,Risky tho
1616398067,It could go anywhere
1616398084,🤔 Binance says I have 0.1 bnb when I look at the fees section but I have no bnb whatsoever
1616398089,I don’t think it will go down too much. Just gotta wait for more stores to be added I guess
1616398105,guys is 250-300 ms fast on binance?
1616398158,yo bro
1616398165,is 250-300 ms normal on binance?
1616398756,Sorry idk
1616398792,Is the Coineal listing something relevant for ada? Like could we actually expect some sort of rise/drop?
1616398798,are you going to join $ramp?
1616398811,No
1616398819,Just did my first futures lmao.
1616398830,Pretty low amounts though
1616399133,THETA broke 10$
1616401864,"im still learning, will try futures in next few weeks I hope"
1616402383,😦 I didn't get THETA today because it went up for so long and no asset can only go up.
1616402389,And THETA is like:
1616402544,This morning LUNA went from a lower low to a lower high. Correction incoming?
1616402819,@Drahnreb u still shorting ENJ?
1616402846,"I probably should, but I'm waiting for another outlined opportunity"
1616403023,Same last night. $2. It was free from KuCoin
1616403066,FET is back
1616403302,Somebody was pushing FET so hard
1616403312,A 2.5M buy wall
1616403850,Go in RAMP?
1616403896,I wouldn’t
1616403901,It's dead
1616403908,lost 2 bucks xD
1616403916,would get doritos for that
1616403922,😩
1616403960,This listings dump most of the time
1616403963,"Yea, any crypto that can give me like 10% profit"
1616403975,Unless they aren’t listed anywhere
1616403999,"I have 25% of my money on BTC, 25% on ETH, 20% on BNB and the rest on USDT"
1616404543,From Europe? Yes. From Tokyo? No 😄
1616404654,"Yeah, these Binance listings are always a gamble... Usually the best strat is to immediately put low limit buy orders for people that are dumb enough to market sell on Binance"
1616404690,The announcement of a listing on Binance usually hypes an asset on other exchanges so by the time it hits Binance it's already heavily overbought and everyone is looking to dump it onto Binancians.
1616404741,The only great listing you could have done was Alice
1616404750,Because it was it’s first “going public” moment
1616404813,Not strictly related to this topic but I market sell if I’m in profit and quickly want to move to another coin; would you advise against market selling in all situations no matter what?
1616404890,"No, not at all! I market sell lots of times. Especially when I don't have time to keep watching if the price hits my limit. Because you could miss a good opportunity to sell by looking for a better one and then it goes down ..."
1616404910,just that market-anything on a first minute candle for new listings is stupid 😉
1616404932,"that's how you get 30,000% range on ALICE from $0.01 to $30"
1616404953,Ah ok thanks
1616405063,Lotsa people lost money on alice
1616405175,sure lots made $$$$ though
1616405202,Fingers crossed for SYL
1616405345,Crossing everything lol I need my first 100j bag to be Very very good :))
1616405400,I plan to sale half on listing what ever spike will be ans other half to hold for a year and see what next maybe hold more or same sale half and leave other half for another year. /)
1616405553,I missed that one due to vacation
1616405571,Had a large amount of funds setup too but connection proved to be too unstable thus risky
1616405647,I did made money on Alice second wave
1616405665,But that was due to the coin going public for the first time
1616405673,It peaked at 60%
1616405677,60$
1616405691,Only because people market buy
1616405725,ok thanks man. I am from Sweden
1616405998,THETA #11 on the ranking
1616406005,LINK is next
1616406232,TCT is going wild
1616406357,I have 0 knowledge regarding that coin
1616406381,Any reason why it’s going up?
1616406419,I have no idea why
1616406424,No news to be found
1616406428,No announcements whatsoever
1616406430,🤔
1616406450,Huge volume all of a sudden
1616406498,I put $900 in last week and it’s $1250 now
1616406507,Keep it in mind for the next pump
1616406514,from where you taking the news from a massive pump???
1616406590,I just look at my wallet from time to time
1616406596,And then notice it went up
1616406612,yes not from the coins you have
1616406633,from random coins with 100% pump within 24hours
1616406847,Uhh usually you should stay away from those
1616406851,Pumps are high risk
1616406882,A few buddies jumped in on one and lost €500 each in 10 seconds
1616406911,from a pump on disc server?
1616407076,Yah
1616407105,When ppl are discovering bullmarket but werent here before
1616407109,yes i agree stay away from these scams
1616407148,I also bought there
1616407163,10x now seems very likely
1616407269,Theta did it well
1616407492,I bought some when i think satori was talking about it going 10 but then it went down and people stopped buying. I kept my 18 theta
1616407662,nice you dont panic
1616407709,I got people to talk me into ADA a while ago. Lotsa people didnt HODL and a x24 is really nice
1616407798,"Also, any predictions on if the 100:1 denomination of DREP is going to affect the price?"
1616407826,ada pamp
1616407881,I plan to sell everything for as much as possible and then buy back some a day later or so when prices have corrected 😀
1616408204,Wellp. Tried posting a link to TCT’s twitter
1616408210,But they just made an announcement
1616408214,So I guess big stuff coming up
1616408359,That’s all it takes to collect millions in crypto
1616408369,Announcement and sell :kekw:
1616408374,Create a tweet with the announcement of something
1616408384,Don’t say what it is So people can hype it
1616408534,Ugh sold my dent earlier and it's taking off again
1616408851,Anyone thinking this DENT is gonna dump hard at 1c?
1616409051,Just hold on we're going home

1616409207,Holding till 2040
1616409208,Hope you are extremely young
1616409231,"It's for my son, not for me"
1616409244,That’s better
1616409296,Every one pump ramp
1616409303,Hope it goes >0.009
1616409311,And I’m going in
1616409448,Whoever said Ramp was going x5 because of binance listing
1616409454,U dumb
1616409461,anyone that does futures explain how to make the adl go down?
1616409816,Someone mentioned it had already gone up a decent amount before it was listed
1616409928,im happy
1616409935,i slept on dent lol
1616409987,Dent made me like $800 today I'm happy even though I sold to soon
1616410004,Must have had a fair bit in it then
1616410036,"Damn😆 
Just got a hold of Argentinian Peso
The damn thing looks almost exactly like euro only its 0.009€ i bet it costs more to produce it than its worth"
1616410044,I bought om dip to that was good and got out
1616410101,Now got into CHZ waiting for that pump to over .60
1616410115,inflation intensifies
1616410145,"I made a quick $30 on DENT earlier, could’ve probably made double that had I held my nerve a bit longer"
1616410156,Back into STMX it goes
1616410324,I lost 2k by selling FET to early
1616410341,Did not expect that pump

1616410926,I dont think ripple

1616426676,Views on SiaCoin
1616427126,"interested to see why it would be a 3% loss. What time periods are you using for it? The guy says 12h, 1D & 2D are the best use, but I guess they're too slow to make decent profit. Either way, even on a 15min scale, it still shows buy low, sell high consistently. Only a couple of times I've seen it not like that I think on a 1min/3min scale"
1616427136,You must not research Cardano much if you you think it’s going to die.
1616427154,"“Ada will die”
>Still top 10"
1616427155,Okay
1616427226,"@SeineJanie are you a Windows guy or MacOS? That AutoSignals thing only seems to work on a Windows machine which sucks. Wish there was a Mac version, but I've not looked too hard into it - I might be able to code something.
I'm only on trial so he won't trial me the Trendfinder, that's only in the Gold plan. Is that what you're on?"
1616427229,dent 🤰🏻🤰🏻🤰🏻🤰🏻🤰🏻
1616427320,Ant coin will pump soon
1616427456,"Both, but right now I'm on Windows. I didn't use that tool though to set up the alerts. Just add them in TradingView manually. AutoAlerts is good if you manage lots and lots of alerts. I got 4 on TV rn, I can manage them manually."
1616427512,What wallets do you guys pair to uniswap?
1616427515,asking for a friend
1616427554,"Because I've set it to ""Once Per Bar Close"". Previously there were a couple of alerts where the signal was removed later because the candle moved in the other direction afterwards. So in order to be secure I set it to that. Which means, you will always get the close price. And if you compare the last 4 signals, if you went long on buy signals and short on sell signals at candle close, you would lose something. Also amplified by me using BLVTs. 🙂"
1616427595,ah that makes sense! I'll take that into account
1616427605,"DENT past 0.01, wow..."
1616427633,predicted by @Dani_tzt  a day or so ago?

1616428581,oh thats good
1616428593,If Ada breaks 1.17 itll go till 1
1616428593,@homelessman you getting back in HOT? seems bullish to me
1616428605,I'm always HOT
1616428622,For a chance to get in it is. For the pre sale price not. Since they use auction method
1616428629,soon to be a good time to get into CHZ if anyone is looking for a decent entry
1616428661,Took the money from ENJ put on DENT already doubled the money
1616428706,The only one that's fuckin the job is ADA and it's by far the greatest project in my portfolio
1616428774,Whatcha holding?
1616428880,
1616428943,@Internal Target is sending scam messages @Kyle
1616429605,just got $150 on CHZ - surprised my low limit order filled - lowest bollinger band 0.53731
1616429726,ADA at a critical support level
1616429736,needs to hold out
1616429739,It'll go back to 1 dollar
1616429756,what should i invest in
1616429772,Birds
1616429782,nah i was thinking people
1616429786,like id rent them
1616429812,Britain English birds
1616429833,CHZ if you can catch it around 0.53-0.54 - hold for a week

1616429885,It's best for you if you dyor
1616430094,Do you mean cctv cameras
1616430127,😹 😹 😹
1616430134,Could be that
1616430157,Damn ENJ is done for now
1616430241,Ada too
1616430350,So at least almost everyone here is fucked for now
1616430365,How... umm... sad?
1616430387,"Eh, ada will go back up"
1616430393,$2-$3 by the end of the year
1616430397,
1616430405,Enj too
1616430441,Just needs time
1616430456,The thing is.. are you happy with a 2x return?
1616430469,Cause i’m not
1616430471,I got in at $0.05
1616430481,I’m already happy
1616430483,I 3xd my money in the last 2 months
1616430498,There are better chances in this market
1616430506,Eh that’s fine
1616430513,But there’s risk and low risk
1616430519,Ada is low risk low reward
1616430526,"So for consistency, it’s a good choice"
1616430535,Yes it definitely is
1616430551,I had a big position in ada
1616430555,Good choice were my calls
1616430560,meanwhile everything else x10 EOY
1616430562,Next one will be aion
1616430567,"@felguerr thanks for the dent call you sexy mf, also is that your car?"
1616430567,Anyone owner of some Verge?
1616430569,Midterm
1616430571,I highly doubt that
1616430581,And thank god coinbase launched ada
1616430585,People forgot we’re in a bull market
1616430590,Or i would still be down
1616430593,No but i found it funny
1616430594,And switch to bear market is coming
1616430609,I hope it doesn’t hit before the summet
1616430612,Summer
1616430631,Idfk I can see the crypto market halving or even going down harsh
1616430631,I never experienced the bear market before
1616430644,Started a year ago
1616430652,When the bull run began
1616430653,Next bull market will prob be ~2023-2024
1616430667,What do we do in the bear market?
1616430670,Short?
1616430681,Cry and hope for the best
1616430686,And keep investinging
1616430686,😂
1616430689,"I was using a tradingbot (gunbot) and I got left with lots of bags of coins which lots LOTS of value. Lost quite a bit of money, lost interest in Crypto until Jan this year again"
1616430691,To be rich 3 years later
1616430691,You really dont know
1616430713,$AION is the next one to moon?
1616430723,He said midterm
1616430724,Bear market is not fun - lots of shit loses value
1616430737,So HODL and wait for next cycle
1616430748,Yeah i know all these shitcoins are gonna be dead
1616430751,Corona has made investing a lot more interesting to a lot of people
1616430754,I guess there's more options these days to Short stuff than 3 years ago.
1616430763,"And it’s like the cycle of nature, like a forest"
1616430767,Here i am
1616430769,Rotten trees die out and get replaced
1616430774,And thank god it did honestly
1616430783,Made some serious money
1616430783,I made enough money to buy a house and cashed in
1616430805,Only got some bags left and now I’m looking at the practical side of crypto
1616430809,Like if my portfolio goes to 0 I’d still have made some good money
1616430826,I also cashed out most of my profits
1616430828,@hollowviper you got back into chr?
1616430832,Next wave is busy
1616430840,Yeah lmao but watching it is making my eyes hurt
1616430855,I bought back in 0.3925
1616430863,Back on 60% profit :p
1616430869,Nice
1616430878,I got in .3950
1616430892,I would like to see it do just a little bit more than shit itself at .42 tbh
1616430914,what's pumping?
1616430961,your mom
1616430965,"It is more complex than that guys and also at the same time easy to understand.
Cycle are pattern and were always the same since the beginning centuries ago.
Now the question is does the crypto market will act like the telecom market and go for a 5+ years of 🚀 with some correction, or will it consolidate and found is steady position when mass adoption comes. 
Or does the regulation will kill it starting this year/ next one and a new bear market will follow for next 4 years"
1616430988,whats up with all the private msgs saying i won shit KILL YOURSELF
1616431002,In any case it is important to always take profit even with long term bags
1616431002,local btc millionaire kills himself
1616431012,source
1616431023,or at least adjust SL
1616431034,At least
1616431041,Smart suggestion: Invest $100
1616431052,So when it goes to $125-$150 you can trim@it
1616431055,And reinvest
1616431064,you won 9100 eth yeah ok thanks SEND IT
1616431064,This ensures your long term profits and growth are far more stable
1616431066,$100 pocket change
1616431076,It’s an example :kekw:
1616431078,It is only true in bullmarket
1616431084,I yoloed 10k on mbl in february
1616431086,It doesnt really work
1616431101,God that was delicious last week
1616431166,I hve 20+ coin in my portfolio entered since a while so everything is highly green for me now. But before it happens i had to be patient and confident
1616431208,But for the new comers who buy now at the top
1616431216,Please be carefull
1616431251,Cuz you are buying when somes are going to take big profit
1616431267,Different point of view
1616431280,Thats why we call fomo fomo
1616431301,Ppl are saying ada x2 is not enough
1616431323,It is huge stop comparing this cycle with normal times
1616431342,i made x10 on ada
1616431357,And if it continues to 2$ it is still hugee
1616431370,Cuz the x10 took like more than 5months
1616431383,invest 50k in ada and ez lyfe
1616431410,People seem to think that dollar value is everything
1616431422,And don’t look at project value or the value of staking
1616431422,decentralized internet
1616431429,60% chromia was huge as fuck
1616431441,With a large bag of it
1616431930,When I said that Ada 2x isn’t big I meant that for those who are interested into buying it now
1616431998,Unless you already have a lot of money you would want to risk the small amount you put in trying to make bank
1616432008,At least that’s my perspective
1616432062,If i had 500$ I wouldn’t invest it in something that can give me 500$ profit in a year
1616432103,I also understand the point of view of the older people in here
1616432121,Nah young kids are just greedy
1616432136,"Gratification NOW.
Profit NOW.
Balls tickle NOW."
1616432142,To me a 2x from now on theta means a decent bag
1616432148,Cause I bought at 2$
1616432167,But for others that’s not that big of a deal
1616432402,Are you telling that Ada isn't going to 10 dollars before the year ends? 🤡
1616432427,"Definitely doubt it because of market cap, volume and intended distribution of supply"
1616432434,$5 maybe
1616432579,Biggest fun I’ve had today is watch ramp go lower
1616432587,Despite all the shills saying it’ll double or more
1616432787,Ada has been pointed as the next crypto sensation
1616432797,Read that on te news
1616432820,I think by the time of smart contracts or it goes rocket or I'm selling
1616432823,Ada has the potential once smart contracts are up
1616432824,By then
1616432838,DYOR
1616432852,Ada has the potential to x10 in 5 years but not one year
1616432854,Is that scheduled for April bossman? Or is it whenever (random announcement)
1616432859,"It’s a solid, stable project"
1616432870,That’s why if you’re a HODLer it’s still a good investment
1616432880,I read many different opinions but the world changes everyday
1616432909,Anyone thoughts time ago the value of btc today?
1616432909,If ada x10s I’m happy
1616432924,What was your entry?
1616432926,Look at BTC’s value from 2009 to now
1616432932,$0.05
1616432944,That's exactly my point
1616432947,Nice
1616432954,But nowadays there are much more offers
1616432957,Also
1616432968,"Realize this, it takes x10 the market cap now to reach x10"
1616432976,Which is a lot harder the more money gets pumped into it
1616432994,"If you want to look at good investments, market cap and supply correlation are your best bets"
1616433042,I'll see it after smart contracts
1616433061,By the way I'm not in futures just spot
1616433148,I do spot too for most things
1616433720,I have a leverage gone wrong
1616433723,17k ENJ
1616433735,That’s not healthy lol
1616434163,Come on CHR you little shitbag
1616434184,I’m ou at 0.41
1616434200,Need it to cover my ENJ :’)
1616434236,I haven’t set a TP with this one because I’m HOPING it can go a little higher
1616434295,I got 360% out off chr so far lol
1616434310,Only regret is the amount of money in it :p
1616434316,Ah fuck it pulled the plug I’ll let it drop a bit more
1616434339,I got XRP running quite nicely still
1616434362,I’m trying to catch the ENJ dip
1616434375,But had to reload 4 times already
1616434664,That ANKR coin is also doing some serious waves
1616435325,LMAO i flipped a coin for XRP and AKRO bc they both looked good.
1616435333,i didnt pick the one that climbed 20%
1616435561,Well would you look at that
1616435579,You know where it is? :’)
1616435887,I just realized that Dent went up 10x since I initally bought it 😭
1616435893,shouldntve sold when it was going bad
1616435913,I legit hope theres another opportunity like that

1616437626,What a sentence

1616437665,Rip enj. We all lost.
1616437682,I’m still in it
1616437692,On what it feels suicide mission atm
1616437857,"no, is pump chz?"
1616437873,is pump chz?
1616437879,"Idk, is chz pump?"
1616437941,Pump = chz so if chz equals dump then Because ENJ is dump that means then it’s not true
1616437954,"So what does ""signal hit"" mean? Does it mean the sell zone has been reached?"
1616437965,@mortezachagei I would say no
1616437970,Yeah I believe so
1616437979,XRP hit 0.6

1616438851,in tradingview ?
1616438854,And which one must be used ?
1616439528,Back in CHR
1616439537,The gift that keeps on stressing me the fuck out
1616439541,Actually that’s not true
1616439616,The forever 0.42 coin
1616439631,"Log scale is logarithmic. Is useful when you want to compare years and years of Bitcoin, for example. Because the prices before 10,000 will be just a straight line at the bottom in normal scale."
1616439761,I missed it @hollowviper
1616439764,Damnit
1616439971,So better use normal for daytrade?
1616440015,yes
1616440016,log scale useful for long term ideas
1616440024,you can use it for shorter term ideas too
1616440030,especially after a large spike
1616440123,You guys getting Casper tomorrow?
1616440158,You mean today
1616440174,In roughly 5 hours
1616440186,Oh xD i haven’t checked the time zone
1616440208,Idk if I should try it 😂
1616440259,Tonight 🙂
1616440809,Wait is Casper an ICO?
1616440939,"I just redeemed my chromia from staking and lost $30 in my wallet, what"
1616441106,To be honest I love this. Everything is down and I’m still on a profit
1616441272,I’d like a nice drop
1616441278,Like 50k btc
1616441446,What's Casper?
1616441459,And also what's the deal with Boson?
1616441630,ENJ is still a good chance for steady profits over the next couple months. Just don't leverage it
1616441659,Am I right? @Cryptoknight
1616441706,"Though I gotta say next time it goes up you need to stop with those insane calls like ""+100% in one day"""
1616441852,"I believe so, yes"
1616441938,Wait are you saying don’t leverage it?
1616441952,Damn 😦
1616441955,:p
1616442025,"I'm also trying to find the dip, so I get my hands on as much as possible"
1616442062,I’m in at 2.25 now
1616442084,20.7k ENJ
1616442105,When it rebounces hopefully I will lower it :p
1616442302,Look at my TA chart from last night on enj.
1616442328,It's likely gonna diddle with the $2 mark for a bit
1616442459,Ok I went from -2.2k to -700
1616442463,:’)
1616442744,"Absolutely. Im still 100% portfolio in. Its going to be a little bit rough the next few days, but shortly after will go absolutely mad."
1616442841,Also got a big bag
1616442848,The game is out in a day or two. Cant stay here once that happen. The people want free BTC
1616442870,lol the game came out last friday
1616442876,Got as much ENJ as I could
1616442895,Eh? No it didnt. Its still not out.
1616442916,What game 🤔
1616442920,Im not saying anything to you man. Just dont leverage from my calls. Thats all.
1616442927,Age Of Rust
1616442935,Mad concept
1616442944,age of rust is out
1616442947,19th of march
1616442971,Thank you
1616442992,Beta is available
1616442996,It’s not public
1616443009,https://tenor.com/view/casper-hi-im-casper-ghost-gif-6644911
1616443045,Just read about it
1616443086,Interesting concept. Will only make ENJ stronger in the long term
1616443125,No its not! Lol. Dev is late on delivery
1616443180,"Alpha is available, not beta. Game can only be played if you own some of the in game items, which again, you need to buy using ENJ"
1616443196,Well I’m out then
1616443204,That’s a..... fucking weird concept
1616443208,Sounds really pay to win
1616443251,The winning is just the motivation tho. Not the end goal. Its just a normal game otherwise
1616443269,Beta won't be available to the gen public either. You will need to own one age of rust token to play
1616443299,its a stupid play to win grinder game from what I have seen
1616443301,its pretty tho
1616443320,full release is suppose to cost 15$
1616443343,yknow what my opinion is
1616443349,Shitcoin purchase
1616443355,Hodl and sell when whales enter
1616443487,"IMO its not going to blow up when the game comes out either. Im looking and even if you want JUST the game, the cheapest its being sold for is 270 ENJ"
1616443541,link for source: https://enjinx.io/eth/asset/6000000000000120/
1616443745,those are people who already have the token selling theirs
1616443803,TBH I don't even know how that part works. Im staying far away from NFTs in general. Its a cool niche but its not my thing
1616443833,and eventually all NFTs will correct from the insane prices we see right now
1616443842,That is assuming that they don't become a super niche thing and die
1616444063,you got 20k enj?
1616444073,Yolo
1616444098,(I want to ditch it before I got to bed)
1616444110,NFT is not a stupid idea btw and the chance it grows in all field is high probabilities
1616444131,Especially in video games
1616444187,Now being able to separate bullshit and real use case its an other story
1616444228,LUKSO is the only NFT-affiliated project I trust.
1616444771,Im not sure if you were referring to my message but I agree. Its not a bad idea; There are tons and tons of use cases and honestly there are certain things that will stay absurdly priced; Just look at some of the trading cards that people pay insane amounts for. My point was just that a large majority will have price corrections at the end of the day if it is here to stay
1616444879,"a GIF of a monkey wearing a pimp hat and cane is probably not going to keep its 100k valuation a few years from now; A large majority are overpriced because its a new market that is accepting of these large price tags but everything corrects eventually and in my opinion, buying a NFT is far riskier than investing in NFTs(Buying a tesla vs investing in Tesla)"
1616444935,I totally think investing in NFTs is a good idea. I think buying a NFT is risky. Thats my personal opinion on the matter
1616445136,Anyone that has Mana?
1616445173,"So as far as speculating on a coin based on news is concerned, as I have said before, the real movement in the market occurs prior to the news hitting, as all speculation trading happens when the rumor hits, remember buy rumor, sell news. We have known about this rust game for how long now? The price action relating to it has already happened. If any NEW news were to hit that's a different story, but for now, this 'news' has already played out on enj price action, you can see it for yourself
 The descending flag is probably linked to the game not reviewing well plus buy action exhaustion which is TA combined with FA."
1616445436,"is btc likely to crash? im starting to learn TA with some videos on ytb, also if there is another place to learn about it i would like to know"
1616445604,"Also, in continuation, even if enj is used as the literal currency for the game, shift in its value on the exchange would have to be mammoth, a big price spike upwards would have to be fueled by the kind of legendary game release hype we see for games made by the big guns like Bethesda etc, this game is not it. As a gamer girl (old lady more-like) can speak with some confidence on the FA side for once. Also, many of my friends are hardcore gamers/twitch streamers from years back and they keep me informed whether I like it or not."
1616445742,dont worry japan will POOMP soon
1616445774,You’re starting to sound like them now...
1616445816,I predict. next saturday ENJ will be at 3.2
1616445878,I predict next saturday ENJ will be at 1.2 that way we can hedge eachother's positions
1616445932,all mother of BTC dumps
1616446020,Make it stop
1616446186,SELL EVERYTHING. ITS ALL OVER

1616446285,I bought as much as I could
1616446291,Everyone is converting to USDT to buy Casper
1616446349,NO BUY DOGE THIS IS STILL A BULL RUN
1616446424,Just wait till Elon tweets ffs
1616446435,excited ada long and BNB long
1616446448,might do a 30X ADA long for quick profit
1616446450,maybe
1616446475,Why is everything dropping?
1616446483,fuckcoin

1616447006,We've got a beat..
1616447015,I sold everything for whatever measly profit I could as btc dump likely to go further
1616447042,4hr chart not looking good
1616447046,Huge sell energy
1616447061,fackkkkkkkkkk

1616447088,we've gotten low enough 😦
1616447350,think it will go down even more today?
1616447358,because it's looking more likely over the next few days
1616447374,"we just formed a new lower low, we recover a few thousands and then drop again"
1616447398,53500k easy. If it doesnt get around there I will make @Alanox  eat my toenail clippings
1616447457,"fair price prediction, but I think we'll recover for a bit first, then find the resistance and likely drop further, to 53k like you suggest"
1616447484,My gains noooooo

1616447548,that's the most soul crushing part of it
1616447558,gotta take profits from the exchanges...
1616447564,"they're yours, take them"
1616447569,don't put them back into the market
1616447592,yep. I keep 4k in my exchange and skim at the 5k mark back to 4k
1616447599,Primarily for my own safety
1616447611,"If I keep too much in there, I'll meme it away on stupid trades"
1616447612,Well that was the easiest and quickest 30% I've ever made.
1616447635,Too bad it was with $1.50 🤣
1616447653,the fact that btc right now can't break 55k is really worrying..
1616447656,please GOOOOOO
1616447656,hey 1.50$ is still 1.50$. Get you a hamburger and enjoy the profits
1616447657,please.
1616447685,"if we drop more today, altcoins will stop breathing"
1616447687,:kekw:
1616447738,"Don't worry, be happy 😆"
1616447747,"Guys, check out the new blockchain based social media app PanQuake"
1616447775,Don't trust cats sorry
1616448010,@Sausage Destroyer  I'm holding BTC ETH VET UNI and AAV.  I'm already down 1k below my initial investment.  What should I do?  Just hodl and wait for everything to go back up?
1616448039,I'm also holding 1inch and BNB
1616448062,"all very safe, just hold"
1616448065,"Not Crypto Domme but if you own them spot, then I personally would just HODL. This would be a bad time to sell tbh"
1616448082,"Yes holding spot,"
1616448101,"yeah, I believe Crypto Domme was in slight profit so she wasn't selling at a loss. you very much would... just hold"
1616448135,"you would lose quite a bit of capital off that loss and it would take some miracle saves to make it back up. Remember if you buy 1000 X-Coin at 1$ a piece and sell at 0.80$ a piece, when it gets back to 1$, you will only be able to afford 800"
1616448141,My 30 day PNL is -30% 😳
1616448149,don't look at those stats
1616448158,they're soul crushing and they don't help
1616448158,"-2,500 USD"
1616448162,losing capital off selling during a huge dip makes it to where you can't buy the same amount of capitol later on
1616448171,if we close a daily below 53400 then there'd be a reason to start panicking
1616448185,"So its more often then not, better to HODL"
1616448221,"just remember that 1 BTC, ETH, VET, UNI, or AAV is still worth 1 BTC, ETH, VET, UNI, or AAV"
1616448263,You didn't lose any capitol. The coins just lost value which is normal. You still have the same amount of coins so its normally a good idea to just HODL unless you are running leverage
1616448292,"@Jeremyfto  thanks,"
1616448317,This drop is ripping our assholes to shreds
1616448337,"I guess I was wondering if I could use this price drop in my favour somehow to regain my 2,500 that I'm down"
1616448379,"Like for instance if BTC was going to drop a lot lower, and I sold x amount of btc now and then bought back in at a much lower price,"
1616448392,If we were entering a bear market however and you dont plan on selling you should expect to hodl for another couple of years
1616448394,Thats risky. You could try to figure out which coin is going to recover faster BUT it honestly wouldnt be worth it to me if I was in your position
1616448398,"Then when the price goes back up to 60k I would have made some gains, right?"
1616448488,figuring out how high a coin is going to go has a bit of TA but figuring out a recovery rate is a bit more up in the air. You can kind of figure out with triangles the approximate date that something should make a deciding move but its all approximation
1616448519,Honestly the only thing I personally am considering is buying if it starts recovering
1616448529,And even that is risky on my part
1616448584,Im not liquidating things right now
1616448586,I dont think we're entering a bear market just yet. I do think BTC will test 52k at some point soon.
1616448631,Okay but what about the predictions from stock and flow analysis for BTC?
1616448641,The only coin I'm losing money is ADA
1616448641,That it would hit 6 figures this year
1616448659,*stock to flow I meant
1616448662,I think thats why this happening now is important. Otherwise it would crash the moment it hit 6 figures.
1616448700,testing 52k is fine. closing a daily at 52k is a strong bearish signal
1616448715,"My two cents, If we dont test 52k in this run itself, odds are we will after the next jump. Good time to short your alts."
1616448719,"The later it hits the top for this bull run, the higher it could theoretically go"
1616448749,That's not true
1616448790,"Oh man. I really hope that doesnt happen. Lol. Closing at 52K will kill its 1d trend completely. Also, if the testing happens after 3-4 days, 52k is anyway too low."
1616448844,I just hope we're shaking the weak hands. we did that twice that run then bounced back up tremendously
1616448845,Theoretically it is. Practically no one knows yet
1616448862,Btc will drop even further
1616448879,But the dumping is not organic tho.
1616448887,problem is i'm noticing alot of fud around btc in several countries
1616448908,Why do you say this
1616448923,This massive sell off was a few whales I presume
1616448947,It has too before go ath again
1616448951,Few? The amount of money requried for this drop would have been insane.
1616448953,"as long as it stays this volatile and controlled by the few elites that control the direction of the market, FUD won't go away."
1616448971,i saw a german article saying how crypto will crash 100% and urging the german people to sell off everything  and another Indian one with the same rhetoric
1616448977,I think FUD like that is completely understandable and fair
1616448992,and countries should stay on alert and stay clear of full bitcoin adoption until there's a change
1616448992,yeah we'll always see fud
1616449000,because what's currently happening is sad
1616449009,"and it doesn't do any good to crypto, bitcoin or anything else"
1616449010,we just don't want retail investors actually biting on the fud
1616449010,I saw an article today that said BTC was going to 300k. I try to ignore articles in general as most push what they want to happen unfortunately
1616449016,That's not sad
1616449023,That's called opportunity
1616449028,Youtubers are even worse but on the opposite end of the spectrum from what I have seen. Most youtubers are super bullish
1616449034,like WAY overly bullish
1616449036,"and again, I don't expect btc to just go up... but these insane dumps that happen within a few seconds are just so dangerous"
1616449040,nobody wants that kind of risk
1616449043,especially governments

1616449058,I saw one that said ETH 16k by EOY which is a very sucky prediction

1616449108,yeah spot seems to be the move
1616449117,It would be very difficult to figure that stat out
1616449121,but would be interesting to see
1616449130,you know what's weird tho
1616449139,that german article was posted on a crypto app
1616449155,"And how Xelo once said, if you spot bought 1 k Ada you don't have 1 k dollars or 1 k euros, you have just 1k Ada"

1616449671,"1AM today is gonna be insane, I'd recommend getting out 20mins before 1AM, before day candle close"
1616449678,it usually gets volatile around that time
1616449684,especially today with how things are going
1616449701,Keep calm and trust Jeremy
1616449703,ETH 2.0 doesn't have to fully come out btw. Phase 1.5 removes the current gas model
1616449720,which is a huge hindrance on the price
1616449734,1am UTC/GMT?
1616449735,Jeremy take the wheel
1616449741,Thats really the biggest part of 2.0 that is important
1616449747,is keeping the gas prices in check
1616449749,"1AM GMT+1, midnight GMT"
1616449750,there are other great things about it
1616449758,yeah i wanna see 1.5 roll out though
1616449761,But the gas prices are currently out of control
1616449785,there are a ton of layer 2 solutions out there and more in the works
1616449797,i dont think these companies are very hopeful on 1.5
1616449800,There are many articles related to the energy spent by btc
1616449805,There is estimation of summer-fall of this year but of course there is no concrete dates; It is a gamble but if it works out then its gonna be big green
1616449837,Basically buying into ETH is betting that the new gas model will come out before the demand dies out
1616449846,its not for everybody
1616449848,if it rolls out this summer i'll go balls deep on eth
1616449875,i've seen too many broken promises with eth
1616449895,not much incentive for me to go all in atm
1616449903,And what have you learned?
1616449906,"The thing is if anything concrete about it rolls out, it will likely go up before many people have time to get in on the price it has now. For sure its safer to wait till 1.5 comes out but it will also cost you the price difference"
1616449911,thats why I say its a gamble
1616449925,You can choose or choose not to bet that the devs will release in a timely manner
1616449932,Jeremy saga part 2 is officially been released
1616449945,Now on discord
1616449949,yeah i just don't have much believe in eth short term
1616449959,i see massive potential in other projects
1616449971,And thats respectable. Its not wrong for not wanting to get in on the ETH gamble
1616449990,i wouldn't care if it goes to 10k i wouldn't be missing out on anything imo
1616449998,it could pan out or it could not; There is no for sure signs and its not a bad idea to not trust in it
1616450065,"I understand why a lot of people wouldnt want to join in on ETH; Its reasonable not to. It will pay off big time if it does and you make that gamble but if it doesn't, some other coin will pass ETH and then ETH will likely tank"
1616450112,EIP 1559 will be the first big test for it
1616450124,I'll see how it rolls out and decide then
1616450266,

1616450556,"Guys,"
1616450565,Monday is the new Sunday lately

1616450713,@Jeremyfto also i'm going 7x on eth just 35$ testing the market
1616450815,I hate this
1616450820,I’m aboht to get liquidated
1616450834,Every single trade I go on just goes fucking ⬇️
1616450856,I’m still on hold for bank because they’re dumbasses. At least they held me back so I can get a better deal LOL￼
1616450893,whats the meaning of bear market?
1616450914,falling over time
1616451094,😄
1616451108,ENJ to the moon ❤️ @Cryptoknight
1616451126,My balance is a fking bear market
1616451128,Fuck! ENJ is holding up really well here
1616451143,"Everyone chill, zoom out, things dont go straight up, bitcoin has barely dipped below the 20 daily MA"
1616451148,Be that Zen
1616451154,I'm drinking a cup of tea
1616451157,Buying more
1616451160,Sales babbbby
1616451166,The worry is the next dip bro. Not the last one. We're testing 52k today most likely
1616451174,That's fine
1616451181,"You told me yesterday that was too late for me to buy, that it was going to 5 $. Lol"
1616451188,Could this be the potential start of the bear market?
1616451188,Sales on sales
1616451199,"Yeah, didnt see this BTC thing coming"
1616451229,so what are we buying dirt chip?:P)
1616451242,BTC firstly
1616451247,"Lol. Also, if i had seen this coming. I would have sold all ENJ and bought now. Haha"
1616451266,"What's it then goes back up, sell high and into Alts as they moon"
1616451266,So don't act like a specialist
1616451271,This is not advice
1616451277,I specialise in horses
1616451278,yea this absolutely looks like a bear market. give it another month or so before we make a call like that
1616451305,1D chart gives me hope
1616451312,Never said i was. Lol
1616451320,1 direction chart 😄
1616451322,actually im pretty sure you have
1616451349,Never believe in a fanatic
1616451370,You're thinking of my last nickname - EnjinWhiteKnight. I did not set this to be my nickname. It was the admins. Lol
1616451381,ok all my leverages are brought down
1616451388,everything moved to futures
1616451395,Do did a future didnt you
1616451401,lets try to survive this 😂
1616451410,Seem like it
1616451420,Not sure thats the best idea. Kaleo has been on about 52k
1616451432,I mean my spot account
1616451440,my money to create more leverage :p
1616451455,Ahhh. Wish i had done this.
1616451456,to salvage my existing futures
1616451476,I was warned about this dump yesterday btw
1616451476,Only if you have the bank to take the hit
1616451504,It's better to lose some than lose it all
1616451521,my ENJ liquidation is 1.67
1616451528,dollars?
1616451531,yea
1616451533,I think you're safe then
1616451565,"Im not making any more predictions. But yeah, we seem to be strong at 2.07. But if BTC falls to 52k. No idea what will happen."
1616451566,But you're leverage is low
1616451603,"Ooh shit that spike down, I'm about ready to mail @Alanox my toenail clippings"
1616451628,Could you take a picture and post here please. Might distract us all from the horrid reality that is today.
1616451635,"I wasn't trying to pull you down, just don't be a blind lover"
1616451646,yoooooooooooo when can i expect this?
1616451649,"I wouldnt, as too many of the degenerates here fap to feet"
1616451650,Meet me in real life. Then you'll see.
1616451667,When btc dips down to 53500
1616451672,But Kayne was banned no?
1616451676,See what? 😹 😹
1616451693,Lol. Nevermind.
1616451706,Don't be shy
1616451745,you have my address boo 👀
1616451756,Blind lover - nowhere close.
1616451785,almost touched the bearish target
1616451799,Is buying and selling XMR allowed?
1616451807,Its not over IMO
1616451825,never surrender
1616451830,Damn thats some strong support
1616451835,hodling to 3k
1616451856,Whats the target tho?
1616451871,53400
1616451889,we have to close a daily at or below it tho
1616451939,52-53 is the projected fall tho. Its likely we'd get there
1616451986,getting there is not a problem
1616451994,"So wait, you're saying if we cross this number, we're in a bear market?"
1616451998,closing there is worrisome
1616452001,Ohhh
1616452022,Ok. Lol. Fuck. Then i think we have a problem
1616452030,This is horridly hilarious
1616452054,we're good so far
1616452059,this could be another shakeout
1616452060,"53,650 is the bottom"
1616452069,with a 50% bounce after
1616452083,We're at cycle 3/5 as far as i can tell
1616452085,Im hoping we don’t go below 54000 for long
1616452103,pretty much
1616452116,we're at 5 if we close below my target
1616452120,:kekw:
1616452133,This dump started yesterday.
1616452168,yeah
1616452278,
1616452297,we did this twice this run
1616452311,both times were shakeouts with massive bounces after
1616452321,Does this imply BTC could shoot up to an ATH if it sorts itself out like the other 2 times?
1616452331,pretty much
1616452340,Exciting!
1616452352,we could see a 30 to 50% rise after this
1616452358,if we dont close below
1616452432,"As in, 30-50% of the current price increase, so it could zoom up to 70k+? 😮"
1616452487,The lines are not correct
1616452519,easy short term target
1616452556,"Holy moly, now imagine longing that with big bucks lol"
1616452616,"Also thanks for your graph knowledge, this is rather interesting and I’m sure others appreciate it too:p"
1616452851,What’s people thoughts on 1INCH
1616452887,"Remember kids, when buying a dip you wait for confirmation of the upswing first, because if you judge wrong it might not be the dip"
1616452890,so whats the best course of actiong with this BTC drop.. but Btc? or somehting esle? lol i have some USDT hanging for Casper option 3 🙂 so stll time to use it:)
1616452920,ist its still low price? or u mean even Deeper deep?:) sorry if it sounds dumb lol
1616452949,"Everything is either dropping or going into distribution/consolidation right now in response to current btc drop, so, wait for it to end"
1616452968,None of that sentence made sense
1616452970,when is the end? 👀
1616453003,Contrary to popular belief I am actually not a real Goddess.

1616455526,If you have another coin you may first have to sell that coin for one of those 4 after 00:00 (though unsure if they allow that)
1616455555,"meh, I'll probably have to just buy the dip when people start trading their Option 3 tokens 😩"
1616455954,where it will be?
1616455960,coinlist
1616455963,you are not buying it now
1616455981,you need to register. do KYC. register. get BTC on it which takes hours because of traffic
1616455986,might be able to do option 3
1616456034,"thought it was on their own site, if so theres nothing for me to do"
1616456037,good luck and nice profit
1616456325,"Hi guys, I am brand new here, it looks pretty cool 🙂 
The only question I have through my mind now is ""Is it still worth it to invest in ADA?"" 

Since most people tell me not to invest when the crypto is already a BIG thing, but before. And right now ADA is going up, it seems to be already really popular, am I too late ?"
1616456370,technically yes. personally not really. I believe in ADA for long term. do not expect one month big dollar. ADA is not short term.
1616456385,if you were a few months earlier you could of made big bucks
1616456651,"Hum I see, I guess I just have to focus on something else haha, frustrating!"
1616456682,"Hey guys, can I still get in on Casper if I don't have a coin list account yet?"
1616456693,no
1616456716,maybe option 3 but do it NOW
1616456745,https://tenor.com/view/nervous-sweating-wet-gif-7398449
1616456782,Okay what is option 3?
1616456807,"40 days locked, price $0.03"
1616457225,"Okay, will Casper eventually be listed on  binance?"
1616457256,I don't know about this coinlist site: never heard of it before.  Is it legitimate and trustworthy?
1616457265,yes
1616457271,it has done alot of successful launches
1616457284,and casper is a binance smart chain coin so it will most likely be on binance pretty quick
1616457340,"i have a question for our grads,  the signal bar,  is it still in effect or something is changed now ? coz the prices went quite a bit bellow the announced buy zones."
1616457639,again a fcking queue for casper?
1616457660,it was said that there will be queue

1616457884,'random'
1616457892,It's never random 😝

1616457912,i've joined the queue as soon as it opened and 1 fckng hour..

1616457928,imagine starting a sale at midnight knowing you might make people wait hours

1616458091,"Yeah it is a weird time. It's not like they allow U.S to buy, so why this time?"
1616458094,"if someone gets in at any point and there are no more coins please tell us, so we don't wait for nothing.."
1616458122,that's what it's surprising..
1616458128,2 loading bars yay!

1616458181,14 mins queue just to visit the Coinlist site - not even the sale site

1616467357,I wanted tobdo a X50 but enj gave me ptsd
1616467370,I have a hypothesis
1616467376,So people who are gonna do option 3. Lets make a pact.
1616467381,calculate and watch the % the certain coin moves
1616467391,and adjust leverage accordingly
1616467418,essentially trying to line up the percentage gain with leverage in order to get a favorable liquidation price and realistic PnL
1616467419,🤓
1616467423,If any of us is in. We need to have a shopping setting. Where you buy amounts for you and the others unless you hit the wall
1616467456,@felguerr you are doing optioj 2 right? You could fit in a few of us bud?

1616467690,
1616467696,Probably hundreds of thousanrs just going fuck you coinlist.
1616467707,This probabky will hurt their reputation
1616467715,"For those who didn’t get in on Casper, is it too late?"
1616467732,Option 3 should be a risky whot
1616467737,you can try op 3
1616467737,Shot
1616467743,if ur loaded
1616467745,u can try op 2 as well
1616467745,Why risky?
1616467746,should pool together 50k for option 2
1616467757,Is that the minimum or something?
1616467771,yeh
1616467776,Yikes
1616467794,"yea, actual 50k"
1616467985,"what’s this op 2,3?  I’m new here 😅"
1616467993,for the casper ICO
1616468006,"option 1 just ended, with most of us getting the bad end of the stick and missing out"
1616468012,option 2 and 3 are still left
1616468034,Can I ask what’s special about Casper?
1616468057,https://casperlabs.io/
1616468062,whitepaper is in there too
1616468076,Let me see
1616468093,I thought alnost all ICO these days are scams lol
1616468093,just seems like a really solid project with decent partners too
1616468115,its been a pretty heavily discussed one here
1616468138,alot of us take part in ICOs here and we can generally get a pretty good read on where its gonna go
1616468184,i entered in SYL myself
1616468200,(XSL Labs)
1616468203,I see I have to go through the earlier chat discussion on this. What do you think the ICO return would be?
1616468222,What’s SYL 😂
1616468224,"could be anywhere from 0% if u pick a bad one, to over 20000%"
1616468241,i think all of the ones that have been shared here have done really well
1616468275,
1616468283,this was posted a month ago in #🎓post-grads-podium
1616468349,are there ones discussed here that didn’t do so hot?
1616468392,"probably, we dont tend to hear about stuff that isnt promising"
1616468404,but you cant get em all right every time
1616468413,"only got one ass, cant ride every rocket to the moon"
1616468415,Too bad I missed option 1 lol
1616468421,yea
1616468430,the queue system was terrible
1616468435,"Yeah, option 2 seems like a whole lot to bet on"
1616468437,complete luck whether you got in or not
1616468443,Did it sell out right away?
1616468453,pretty much
1616468459,Damn
1616468463,at one point the queue had over 100k people
1616468473,and only 20k ish got to buy
1616468493,I see teather and  eth slow. You know if LtC works here?
1616468533,for purcahasing cspr ?
1616468540,Would you recommend option 3? Price doesn’t seem that different if you talking about a few times of return here... though I do have to read their white paper and do some due diligence before putting money into it
1616468543,Yeah
1616468567,"btc, eth, usdt, busd"
1616468569,i thinkj
1616468570,Also also option 3 doesn’t havelock time?
1616468586,I see. So I would have to change to BTC damn the fees..
1616468609,yea them fees are not cheap
1616468634,I’m curious though you said option 1 sold out instantly. Are people really that comfortable to hold an ICO coin for half a year?
1616468647,people hold crypto for years
1616468651,look at btc as the prime example
1616468662,every coin was brand new at one point
1616468700,"and historically, coins that did well had the best buy in chance at its initial release"
1616468718,"but, icos are just one way to profit off of crypto"
1616468720,there are loads
1616468735,"i daytrade quite frequently, but im doing that less and less"
1616468769,Do you know which country is Casper based in?
1616468797,I think if you have a good methodology day trading can be insanely profitable
1616468824,daytrading is entirely skill dependant
1616468830,"the better you are at it, the better you can do"
1616468831,So participants exclude us?
1616468837,and the barrier to breaking even is very high
1616468842,let alone profiting
1616468844,let alone doing wlel
1616468846,yea
1616468854,usa canada and china were exlcludded
1616468859,with some exceptions i think
1616468859,yeah 100% 9 out of 10 failed at day trading
1616468883,"funnily enough, ive actually made more from day trading then i have from holding"
1616468885,And I suppose the purchase requires photo id identification?
1616468891,"yea, kyc"
1616468950,haha that means you are good at it!
1616468981,my pattern atm is
1616468983,9 good trades
1616468986,1 bad leverage trade
1616468991,back to sq 1
1616469001,and repeatr
1616469014,lol
1616469032,Yeah leverage is really difficult
1616469051,any thought on LINK?
1616469053,I feel like for leverage you would have to do many trades to even out the odds
1616469087,Along that line any thoughts on LTC? Yeah I know now is alt season ..
1616469136,"ltc should be a good profit, since there was mimblewimble update"
1616469303,mimblewimble been in the news for a while but ltc has been under performing compared to BTC for several months now.... really testing patience lol
1616469330,Anyone heard of Ergo also?
1616469783,I wish Powell would just shut up forever
1616469798,Guy keeps making remarks that causes FUD among americans
1616469852,"@raven 🥚
 >my pattern atm is
>9 good trades
>1 bad leverage trade
>back to sq 1
>and repeatr"
1616469854,dude that is me
1616469880,just imagine the gains we get when we eventually make 1 good leverage trade
1616469896,this is totally not how an addict thinks
1616469897,haha
1616469899,🔫
1616469950,I made 3k off a good leverage trade on ETH on the 1500->1800 road
1616469964,I put 1k in
1616469972,the one good trade i made i lost most of the very next day
1616469981,actual clown
1616470016,Honestly futures are hard. Its hard to figure out when and how to take profits. Its hard to manage your leverage. Its hard to figure out how much to put in the margin
1616470026,uh
1616470027,all in
1616470028,max
1616470032,never take profit
1616470033,yep
1616470037,im doing this right
1616470043,"And I'll be honest, the more money I have in my account, the better I preform with futures"
1616470054,:YEP: broke
1616470055,"the less money I have, the more I am trying to do high leverage"
1616470070,"well, more money = more safety"
1616470079,"and not only that, the more money I have, the more money I can spot my margin when things get rough"
1616470105,Futures can be done with smaller portfolios but honestly I found more success when I had more money in
1616470129,it makes sense
1616470139,the safety net not going all in gives you is alot more
1616470147,hard to do 125x with 20 buvks
1616470157,"but if you have 1000 bucks, and then only spend 50"
1616470160,much easier
1616470169,For sure! Its a balancing game honestly
1616470186,Balancing risk vs reward vs insurance for rainy days
1616470194,im trying out akro with a 3x
1616470207,going to tp at like 20%
1616470236,"Im 10xing ETH rn because I assume its going to 1750 very soon after this weird dip phase, once we hit 1750 I plan on adding more to my position at a lower leverage"
1616470255,Aiming for a 4-6x average that I can just sit on for a bit
1616470256,eth feels hard to leverage tho
1616470261,when you can buy actual eth
1616470271,and stake eth for 2.0 prep
1616470287,Honestly I have made enough on ETH to trust in my leveraging skills with it
1616470296,but its not my only bag
1616470304,fair enough
1616470332,im scared to get confident in an asset tho
1616470339,i was doing really well with SUN trading
1616470355,"like, really well. almost doubled my postion over the course of week just by swing trading"
1616470374,"decided to short it where i usually would, and you can see where its at now"
1616470387,thankfully i stop lossd
1616470458,Ya swing trades normally end up bad especially if you dont cut off the bad trade quick enough; I also was swing trading for a bit and also got burned but it wasn't even the loss of money that made me want to stop. Its just stressful watching the charts all day
1616470465,now im just doing longer positions
1616470489,my ETH liq is 1430. Thats safe enough for me to not have to worry or look at it for a while
1616470494,it was the getting confident bit that screwed me
1616470502,when i started going up and down
1616470512,rather than just buying low and selling high
1616470523,i shorted it once and was succesful
1616470525,and was like ok yea
1616470528,this bitch easy
1616470532,next day
1616470536,:(
1616470586,ya that happens too. At one point I had 25 ETH leveraged
1616470592,that was scary as fuck
1616470615,"My salary is 57k USDT, after taxes its about 50k USDT"
1616470633,"25 ETH at a price of 2000$(The price I was aiming for) is 50,000$ USDT"
1616470657,having a position that's goal was my yearly net salary was surreal and scary
1616470709,Iv learned to get over my fear now though. I feel very confident in my trading abilities and I no longer put so much in one position either
1616470754,lol
1616470754,Its still stressful at times and I need a break but I am pretty good at sticking to the trading plans I lay out for myself and not FUDing out of positions early
1616470757,homie put his salary in USDT
1616470761,:kekw:
1616470767,Bloody hell
1616470769,What an addict

1616470849,absolutely
1616470860,20% increase almost
1616470861,BTC is that fat slut that takes two goes to get off the couch
1616470861,not too bad
1616470866,but then again
1616470866,Im so glad USDT is what futures uses for trading 😂 It makes things so easy for me
1616470869,Is banana

1616480255,may not be done falling yet
1616480552,there it goes
1616480554,damn btc
1616480787,What do we all learn from this?
1616480798,"Needed to fall I guess, hopefully means we’ll see it bounce back up even higher next time round"
1616480799,Leverage and margins are a bad thing
1616480854,ADA please get that good news soon please

1616482118,"!warn @Charles Hozz Shilling his ""bulletproof"" TradingView script"
1616482119,
1616482136,That’s like 3rd time isn’t it
1616482333,Do you have an estimate when we will have reached the bottom of this painful dip?
1616482718,is btc going to rise or fall?
1616482777,why does the whole alt coin market follow BTC ffs
1616483089,I managed to get out of everything with only 1k lost. Back to drawing board
1616483416,im not leaving anything
1616483424,just gonna hope it sits on 53k
1616483576,Well thank god i’m half liquid
1616483606,And theta is keeping me alive
1616483654,Who managed to buy Casper? It was only open for 2hr 27min
1616483781,How to get out of this? Switch everything to DENT 😂
1616483934,I’m so glad I sold Drep
1616483966,"> How to get out of this? Switch everything to DENT 😂
@NotMatt that is what I'm working on 😂"
1616484033,I have a feeling it’s not gonna stop
1616484047,Unless BTC actually decided to die
1616484080,What's up with this bcha?
1616484087,Why did it sky rocket
1616484132,It also went down like bad
1616484166,Yeah I know that's what I'm wondering. Could it go back up
1616484328,Seems like some sorta bitcoin hardfork
1616484343,Non-financial advise is to hodl and check bitcoin support levels
1616484354,Stmx looks like reversing but facing resistance
1616484519,Good morning and wtf is happened last night
1616484533,All my orders filled but im still at - profit lmao
1616484578,I felt like this with STMX. It stopped 😦
1616484612,Why did STMX fell?
1616484953,Everything fell
1616484964,Market lost ~10% value overnight
1616484975,"Market fell, millions dead, tragedy"
1616484981,Because of people buying into hype with leverages and margins
1616484987,And then hype failing to deliver
1616485024,"So they cashed their leverages and margins which triggered a decline, which triggered stop loss, which triggered more stop loss etc"
1616485043,Margins and leverages are basically crypto’s biggest hurdle
1616485112,Dent is fun just made back all my loses
1616485208,"I'm a fucking wreck today, stupid Casper sale"
1616485217,Everyone got some ?
1616485285,Well bcha taking off again
1616485335,"If you all re surprised by -5% -10% decrease, i cant just imagine what if -80%, for sure you weren’t here previous years"
1616485483,Damn
1616485488,Glad I bought TCT
1616485495,Otherwise my portfolio wouldve been a trainwreck
1616486098,nope 😩
1616486115,CHZ going back up fast
1616486253,Time to start staking eth 2.0
1616486254,wooo lets go
1616486322,Let’s see if btc can regain 54k
1616487282,
1616487283,gucci
1616487289,ty dent my big broo
1616487599,i need FINANCIAL ADVICE asap!!!!
1616487644,we all need lol
1616487710,True
1616487878,"advice: buy low, sell high"
1616487919,"Ironically, the human psychology is simple. Buy high, sell low. Freak out on simple dips and cry because you did not have proper risk management in place. I mean, kudos to you. What else to say?"
1616487995,"Noobs panic selling is understandable. With market that runs on emotions, expect a massive rally when you think everything is going to ground."
1616488050,Did any of you managed to also buy some casper?
1616488097,"Nah, i gave up when I saw that my place in line was number 80.000..."
1616488131,Same here
1616488138,Like damn just make a distributed pool
1616488146,Queue is plain stupid
1616488188,I was lucky enough to be put in roughly front of the lane
1616488207,At 00:55 got to purchase
1616488212,coinlist lost their reputation
1616488221,socials are filled with pissed off people
1616488237,"I did.  200 usdt.  It will be if I’m right locked for a year and 8%. I might pick here “one someone” and give a way half of 8% “free coins ” 🙂 why? Well, why not lol it suppose to be “free”"
1616488239,alot of people pissed off that they locked down coinlist pro so they couldn't get out of positions/coins during the BTC crash
1616488338,"01:19 here, so tired"
1616488382,Tell me about it.  I have my 300 usdt there as i wasn’t sure where they sale normal site or pro. Other wise I’d just buy all option 1.  Without pain again in Q for option 3.
1616488401,O3 is going to be hell
1616488415,"Well... it looks like we've tapered off at 53k. 52k would have been very interesting and dangerous, but we didn't even come close."
1616488415,O3?
1616488443,But there was so many ppl that of course there will be pissed ppl that didn't buy
1616488453,It's always like that with high demand
1616488458,I would expect Bitcoin to grow further from here. It's back in the middle of the BB on 1D
1616488459,Option 3
1616488516,no guarantees though and **don't** go 125x long just because I made a 30 second TA  😉
1616488536,"Talking about 125x long BTC ... @felguerr, how's it going, my man? 🙂"
1616488612,"live fast, die young :kekw:"
1616488763,Live fast die fast too
1616488993,I didn’t sleep enough lol
1616488998,What price will tara reach today guys? Today it will be listed on 2 exchanges. Kucoin and bitmax at 1 pm (UTC)
1616489200,@Alanox looks like I'm mailing you my toenail clippings
1616489836,
1616489843,Not too bad
1616489958,BTC is too flawed... we need BTC 2 :kekw:
1616490369,"Ramp shills, where is your x5 now when it’s -30%"
1616490386,Iota is moving Finaly as I’ve mentioned it here few times lol
1616490794,Seems XRP is finally picking up after positive results so far on the court case
1616490898,Did someone say BTC 125 long let’s goooooooooo

1616492727,"So, when can I sell my SYL for profit?"
1616492777,When it’s on sale 🙂
1616493057,red morning
1616493062,😦
1616493338,How much did you have to put in to stop getting liquidated when it dipped to 53k?
1616493427,Dent a buy now?
1616493436,Missed the boat?
1616494016,Probably missed serious gains on Dent but looks to be a steady increase.
1616494040,"But I must warn you, I may put some in and when I do, it is guaranteed to tank so maybe short it"
1616494159,"get DATA, trading competition going"
1616494163,Expect rocket price
1616494230,"If you need proof, look at LUKSO, VRA and CHZ. Every one of those decreased as soon as I purchased. At one point I was 45% down on LUKSO"
1616494274,"If there's a medal for being the worst trader on here, I'd win"
1616494334,Why not short everything
1616494342,Have you held ENJ?
1616494442,Nah I'm put off by that for some reason
1616494462,Oh and I lost a lot on ADA
1616494470,"Then you can forget about that medal, you aren't even on the podium 😂"
1616494695,Ada will go up
1616495005,Yoyo
1616495025,Theta surpassed 11 dollars :)))
1616495103,Theta is kinda risky at this point
1616495106,What’s driving the value
1616496035,wdym risky? 😮
1616496111,personally I'd recommend StudentCoin ICO - not a quick win but a decent potential for a x100. It's been discussed quite a bit on here. Here's my referral link for a small bonus if you sign up https://studentcoin.website/?ref=Sxbe3fxri3
1616496146,Why is theta so high
1616496151,That’s my question
1616496234,"Well I think the project itself is really undervalued, for what it actually is - the upcoming events for the end of March are gonna be huge for THETA with the launch of mainnet 3"
1616496263,"It’s also backed by google, Samsung and whatever so it’s pretty noice"
1616496354,"Intriguing, thank you for the answer"
1616496363,I’ve had it for a while but sold at 11 dollar
1616496696,Lads i am depressed
1616496708,Missed casper. Btc still having an aneurysm
1616496872,Ankr is going up
1616496873,I’m happy
1616496897,So far 9/10 projects I’ve invested in on spot have gone 50% or higher
1616496909,But feck DREP was a mistake
1616497076,Startef at posi 97k endef at 70k and it sold out
1616497086,I need a CHZ football team signing real bad
1616497086,@raven 🥚 how are u still awake 💀
1616497208,😫
1616497212,Also u didnt sleep?
1616497454,I also missed Casper Option 1. But we still got Option 3

1616497993,personally im against vaccines and against your copypasta shilling tbh
1616498044,either
1616498054,It’s the unfounded pasting of bullshit and then “dyor”
1616498064,I’m allergic to that
1616498216,"How is it possible ?
They are all mid long term.
Either you buy high or you re impatient or both."
1616498282,Heres me shilling a coin but dyor 🥰❤️
1616498301,"thing is you can't tell when the high point is. I even slept on Lukso before making the purchase. But it just kept increasing - like I missed out already. I buy, then it goes down; lots"
1616498388,"The general rule of thumb is, if you see a large spike increase or a large upwards trend, sit it out, watch the graph as there will eventually be a correction and in that correction/ dip you can buy, that’s what I do anyways"
1616498509,"He bought?

Domp eet"
1616498534,but you never know its the ATH until you look back at your losses
1616498542,"but hey ho, you only lose when you sell"
1616498544,so I'm keeping
1616498617,"its all a gamble at the end of the day. you win some, you lose some"

1616501081,Ripple is the company that has rights to the product
1616501085,“Owns” in a way
1616501107,So it’s a centralized currency
1616501108,Xrp = call of duty

1616507759,think it will go up?
1616507772,cuz i saw lowmarket cap and lowpricr
1616507851,"Dk, I think it will but not that fast"
1616507910,From the cheap coins I bought wink has the less growth
1616508168,ok ty boi
1616508199,go dent go
1616508256,that what i was looking
1616508272,it was whale ?
1616508508,Ankr ath?
1616508638,KuCoin trading bot is quite good
1616508670,Anyone else using it?
1616508683,It's free but only on their phone app
1616508790,is it easy to setup?
1616508799,2 clicks
1616508810,These are running on default settings
1616508869,does it have a risk setting?
1616508927,yo look nice
1616508934,maybe i will take a look this week
1616509031,No risk setting but you can do customized settings here
1616509048,this manipulation of dent is on whole other level
1616509071,"Might be worth a try, ty"
1616509075,Why do you say that?
1616509089,"Suppose the risk is if the pairing goes down too much, but see screenshots above, I'm in profit despite the current price below my entry price"
1616509112,Thank you for the share @Vincent Scott will take a look at it
1616509150,we pick pair ourself?
1616509160,yeah but there's not too many to choose from
1616509173,they advise more volatile = more profit
1616509187,More loss too
1616509194,DENT IS COMING BACK
1616509209,can we have alerts for large drops in prices aswell as spikes?
1616509230,"so like, if a price drops 20% or more within a minute"
1616509254,not necesarily - it makes tiny profits on ups and downs of the market
1616509258,you can see the trades it makes
1616509263,catching stuff like that early could give us buy in ops on the way back up
1616509277,Yes but there's always a risk
1616509286,When did you started these?
1616509300,"but then again, if you choose something that goes up lots (like a pump) people say you could just make more by buying and holding....."
1616509321,been running for 6 days
1616509335,
1616509338,Those are the days btc is weak
1616509367,If it goes up again I think you'll lose money
1616509372,"breaking even over the last 5 days, only today as the price recovers to near my entry, has profits come in."
1616509380,"it was just a test for me but i'm impressed, so thought I'd share"
1616509387,*please dyor
1616509398,Exactly
1616509402,You did well
1616509423,but to be breaking even on a 20% decrease is impressive
1616509438,Is there something similar for binance?
1616509446,I don't think so
1616509950,

1616512051,"Hey guys! I'm selling a homegrown software to predict mega pump group (BPS etc.) coins in advance. There's money opportunity even in the case of canceled pumps (because more and more people are using analytics in the same way as this software or others) leading to high price rises prior to the pump. This sunday, I was able to predict MDA over 24 hours prior to the pump, and EVX around 8 hours prior to the pump. I'll only sell a limited amount of copies otherwise the point would be ruined.

1616526670,thats only if it goes to 0.4
1616526673,do we need to prefund a wallet?
1616526673,we had to take some personal measures
1616526692,ERC20-based so you can use metamask
1616526701,ONGG
1616526717,ah ok i can see that now
1616526722,i was wondering what that was for
1616526725,i read and was ok

1616526851,I see that its been having higher lows tho
1616526855,"i will not comment on what measures were taken. regards, alanox."
1616526857,Its because ethnis bad coin
1616526860,so pontential to stonk
1616526885,huh

1616526971,wait so we have to prefund with ETH?
1616526974,no
1616526985,:kekw:
1616526996,oh no
1616526997,i ca see
1616527173,"You pay USDT or USDC and get $AGA back in ETH or MATIC, you choose"
1616527188,🤔
1616527188,ye im starting to get it now
1616527191,this brain works slowly
1616527224,So I deposit money in my MetaMask?
1616527256,"No, you get your AGA into metamask (if you choose that)"
1616527268,you can connect MATIC & ETH to metamask
1616527282,i think they mean to purchase in the first place?
1616527296,"To purchase, you do it with USDT or USDC"
1616527302,normal transfer
1616527331,ok
1616527410,"im assuming you simply simply click on the offer, deposit however much usdt you want"
1616527418,"Just a reminder, you will have entire hour for this pre-sale assuming they do not reach the 250,000 tokens sold before then. You will have time to figure it out as you go. If you are still confused about how this purchase will work, just do your research on the coin and figure out if you want to make the purchase and then when the time comes you can figure out how to make the purchase￼"
1616527470,im salty i missed out on op 1 for cspr so this gets my money instead
1616527524,Do your own research. I personally like the coin and will be purchasing it but figure out if this is the right move for you 🙂
1616527530,heh i missed now too many good ICOs
1616527535,shit happens
1616527676,"As I understood. We buy the coin with USDT or USDC, and the AGA coin connects with out MetaMask ETH or MATIC..."
1616527706,That is my understanding as well. Thanks for the clear description 🙂
1616527737,"yea and unblock me, wanna make a good friendship with y'all"
1616527751,and sorry
1616527757,I didn’t block you. I just turned dms ￼ off

1616527934,Dude i dont have the time to setup this shit in less than a half hour :kekw:
1616527948,"Still going, playa?"
1616527964,"yea, it's going to be a small ""pump""?"
1616527974,"not a pump, pre-sale"

1616528100,"You pay upfront with USDT or USDC and you receive your $AGA on March 30 2021, between 20:00 and 21:00 UTC"
1616528106,to the ETH or MATIC address you give them
1616528138,📈
1616528139,can I get it paid to exodus wallet or is there just no need?
1616528158,this a long hold?
1616528173,I believe Ive got uni swap lionked ot metamask now
1616528193,isn't it that u just pay with USDT? Normal transfering?
1616528199,I'd hold it. hell yes. $AGA went 200% when I first bought it and still is up there
1616528207,yessir
1616528211,"Just went on Bitmax to buy some OMI coins as it seems to be a fucking good option right now but it's going down strongly today, anybody knows why ? 
Is it time to buy or this whole OMI thing was just shit ?"
1616528218,"if Exodus allows ERC20 coins, yes"
1616528223,Trust Wallet does for example
1616528239,so matic is ERC20? know jackshit about matic
1616528268,"https://medium.com/matic-network/what-is-matic-network-466a2c493ae1#:~:text=Remember%20any%20fungible%20crypto%20assets,(Non%2DFungible%20Tokens)."
1616528276,when i inserted my email in the waiting list. All I have to do is to just wait for a mail from AGA?
1616528298,Yeah it seems
1616528306,reading
1616528316,
1616528317,man this is so difficult and just proves how much I hate ETH's chain
1616528333,just wait for an email from AGA?
1616528341,seems exodus doesnt play nice with ERC20
1616528350,"yes and the page will be up on their page as well, so no need to put in email"
1616528358,oki
1616528364,same highkey. BSC for life
1616528378,"Trust Wallet does, but you might need to configure something first"
1616528404,So I just need to move some usdt to uniswap in order to swap for AGA?
1616528419,I would exactly ask the same 😂 cause at uniswap the price is already increasing.. so just wait and get the better price.
1616528496,someone pre-pumping AGA? 👀
1616528514,￼ guilty! JKJK
1616528538,actually
1616528543,i transfered some ALanoxcoin
1616528545,that's why
1616528570,😫 how what
1616528577,fuck ETH and its system hope it burns to 0
1616528639,ewww metamask is a browser plugin?
1616528670,Got my Trust Wallet now lol
1616528675,Unfortunately it’s all too complicated for me a specially last minute.
1616528711,just use trust wallet broski
1616528723,"The pre-sale is on for a whole week, take your time"
1616528726,can i pay with binance?
1616528732,"yes, withdraw USDT"
1616528745,to uniswap?
1616528748,also an app
1616528767,is it so hard to just made operating system wallets. everything is apps and plugins :kekw:
1616528768,"no, to the address that AGA will give u"
1616528787,your phone has an operating system ❤️
1616528797,"oh right, so Im waiting for the email? what was this about the chad referral though?"
1616528797,its a stupid phone
1616528800,not superior linux
1616528802,I'm so lost lol
1616528825,with the code **CHAD217** you get extra 5% AGA
1616528831,thought I was pretty tech savvy until I got into crypto 😅
1616528842,dont worry I've been there too
1616528871,same
1616528896,hoping to lob about 50 USDT into this provided all goes well
1616528903,"it starts in 12 mins, at 20:00 GMT"
1616528958,do I need to prefund some wallet before buying? I have no idea what I'm doing here :kekw:
1616528966,that was my issue with CoinList last night
1616528973,So they answer via Mail when we are on the waiting list with a link to the buy form where we can add then the Referral Code ? How we can get than the tokens with the better price without swapping ?
1616529030,oh jesus am I gna be using erc20 network? fees so brutal
1616529061,"Yes, they will send you the AGA"
1616529173,yeah I hate that too. Fuck ETH
1616529219,"so when we buy this AGA, are going to be providing a wallet address for them to send the AGA to? I just wna get an understanding of how this is gna work"
1616529246,and am I gna be hit with another ERC20 fee on the way to that wallet?
1616529280,"because for the little I was gna put it, I may as well not do it, most of it wil be swallowed in fees lol"
1616529299,Is this an ICO? AGA token already exists right
1616529305,either that or invbest more which means reducing some other positions that would rather not  tbh
1616529305,"correct, I think so"
1616529307,how much yall think btc is gonna go for ? in a month time high low and why ?
1616529315,Pls on mainnet is AGA deployed on?
1616529322,"No, but when you send USDT there will be a fee 😦"
1616529326,ERC20
1616529358,"The thing is that you get AGA 20% cheaper today, with the code we gave you guys, so that should cover the fee + much more"
1616529386,so will it paid twice?!
1616529410,you only send USDT once
1616529413,"Guys, can you tell me where to buy Casper again?  What was the URL?  I want to make sure I go to the legit correct website.  It was coin link or something"

1616530026,is it just that thing i posted and I don't have a specific adress for specific tokens?
1616530047,https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-Your-Tokens do this and add USDC
1616530048,i guess the affiliant code is after putting down the money?

1616530058,uh
1616530066,***
1616530095,They just told me no
1616530100,ok
1616530110,so that means we looking at $40 in fees?
1616530153,"USDC fee from Binance is $15, and from metamask you can lower it"
1616530192,damned binance not allowing me to buy usdc with usdt for some reason
1616530209,"Question 8 is the affiliate code, after payment"
1616530210,welp
1616530216,my funds are stuck in coinlist anyway
1616530221,cant withdraw out
1616530223,ETH gas fees are a cancer
1616530226,"Guys, you have a whole week. Relax"
1616530230,guess i cant do this one either
1616530236,it's not a pump & dump haha
1616530260,meanwhile if you use BSC fees are less than a dollar. :kekw:
1616530269,IS CRYPTO.COM a acceptable wallet? binance is  and not accessible in texas
1616530294,https://www.binance.com/en/trade/USDC_USDT?layout=pro
1616530295,"so just to be sure, Im going USDC through ERC20 to Metamask, Ive added USDC as a token in metamask. This shouldnt just vanish right?"
1616530306,correct
1616530307,Its finbe I got it aha
1616530380,"so for the thing mentioned in post-grad, can I just use a VPN? am I gonna have to kyc? I'm in US"
1616530410,sorry if already asked
1616530413,can't find
1616530421,how long should I be expecting to wait for my USDC to show up in Meta?
1616530440,you could use VPN but I can not guarantee anything
1616530457,"usual ETH times, max 15 min I believe"
1616530522,"oh shite, just realised the min you can use to buy aga is 100 USDC or USDT and ive got just over 90 en route to meta"
1616530535,"ENJ is very low, what do you think guys about putting some order"
1616530541,thats the bit thats killin me scog
1616530543,theres a waste of 15 dolla lol
1616530555,"damn that kinda makes me nervous lol. anyone else from a ""non supported"" area do it?"
1616530600,those $15 fees 😢
1616530613,preach
1616530616,kinda bummed 😕
1616530684,yall need to start accepting crypto that isnt absurdly expensive to transfew
1616530693,@ every ico and sale
1616530742,yup. they do it because its the easiest coins to convert to fiat
1616530769,could we not use binance smart chain to send USDC to Meta?
1616530791,oh wait nvm thats for bnb
1616530801,I'm going to try use a Tron wallet for $1 trasnfer fees
1616530810,"u can bsc for transfers, but it has to be supported"
1616530819,if its not stated its supported
1616530825,you can just lose it if you try
1616530858,yup the USDC recipient needs to support BSC
1616530861,if they do
1616530869,good job. super fast transfer with minimal fees
1616530876,"so I've send some of my USDC to Meta, hope I've done it correctly. I'll send the rest once thats arrived safely lol"
1616530987,"Guys, take your time no rush.  You have to create a metamask wallet to send your USDT or USDC from"
1616531001,It is the simplest way
1616531013,"$15 to send from Binance, then $15 to send to AGA?"
1616531042,"going through the questions on the AGA site. Noob Q, where would I get the TX Hash?"
1616531075,From your metamask wallet
1616531083,I gather Meta will give me that once I send the USDC to thier address?
1616531092,ah good
1616531094,$15 for Binance to metamask but unsure about metamask to AGA
1616531108,yes
1616531212,"Just a thought, but could pancake swap be used to say, transfer bnb to Meta and then trade the BNB for USDC in pancake?"
1616531232,then back to Meta and on to AGA?
1616531268,"OH, my USDC arrived in Meta safe and sound 🙂"
1616531286,Yes
1616531318,could that have worked out cheaper or would more fees have been incurred by the transferring and swapping?
1616531517,

1616532015,"TCT/BTC
TCT/USDT"
1616532016,so I can't swap USDC to ETH to get ETH to pay for fees because I need ETH TO BE ABLE to pay the fees to swap and I can't send USDC to aga because I need ETH to pay for the fees
1616532024,@Shivr26 help this dude lmao
1616532039,"With the discount for this discord you get 5% + 15% which is 20%.  So if the offering was $7.00, after 60 days you are buying it at $5.60"

1616532125,so now I need to get like 40 bucks of eth to cover the fees to transfer from wallet to metamask and then use the rest to send the USDC :kekw:

1616532162,Or is it too late
1616532165,Easier than Casper to get 😂
1616532174,more expensive than casper
1616532179,"I checked an hour or so ago and the price was 1.71,"
1616532181,like genuinely. fuck ETH
1616532182,It's just getting started
1616532187,And now it's 1.85
1616532190,ethereum is a shit coin

1616532312,@Romeeeo were you talking about STORJ?
1616532331,Anyone have advice about buying STORJ?
1616532367,"Well, since the Coinbase Pro news already broke: Not right now I'd say"
1616532470,god how fun it is to spend 50 bucks on gas fees just to use 200 bucks of USDC
1616532544,"oh wow, its that much?"
1616532558,well 15 bucks to send from binance to meta
1616532570,and another 15 bucks to send from meta to aga
1616532589,god il just fucking use some BNB instead of fiat
1616532609,mate I paid fee from binance to Meta twice cos I didnt see that you needed to buy a min of 100 AGA lol
1616532635,"holy fuck, how much will it work out per AGA for you man?"
1616532640,Ouch
1616532680,Can you guys tell me where to buy Casper option 3?
1616532688,What is the URL for the legit website
1616532690,coinlist
1616532693,Or which app is it
1616532693,just google coinlist
1616532700,"Okay thanks,"
1616532713,I don't want to accidentally go to some fake site or scam site
1616532725,Is it coinlist.io?
1616532730,Is that correct?
1616532740,AFAIK yes
1616532745,indeed
1616532751,Oops coinlist.co
1616532755,I wonder why it was a TypeForm form rather than a form on their main website
1616532781,CoinList
1616532809,Also u need to register first.
1616532816,And KYS
1616532827,I just found the coinlist app in the app store
1616532838,CoinList still not accepting deposits
1616532842,Can I use that for the option 3 Casper buy in?
1616532852,I think they should postpone the Option 2+3 dates
1616532880,Ok who canm I help next with AGA
1616532890,Chad can
1616532896,Someone was saying something about the coinlist pro versus regular coinlist regarding buying Casper
1616532966,"just put USDT,USDC, ETH or BTC(i think only BTC deposits work ATM) in the normal wallet not coinlist pro"
1616532978,Was anyone able to use the coinlist app to buy Casper the last night?
1616532984,no
1616532989,no app website only
1616532991,who needs help with AGA?
1616533012,you got 30 bucks in ETH to give me? :kekw:
1616533045,LEt me say that if you don't plan on investing $500 or more it may not be worth it in fees
1616533137,"Okay so with Casper, I wasn't wanting to lock my coins up for 12 months anyway, and with option 3 the price is higher but I can do whatever I want with them and sell them correct?"
1616533149,yes
1616533167,after 40 days iirc
1616533168,listen to this 👍
1616533187,"From what I read from some of the pink letter people here, coinlist has a history of these ICO offerings that do really well,"
1616533206,"Someone said one coin went up 2000% etc,"
1616533220,So what is the forecast for Casper?
1616533231,I mean does this look like a good investment?
1616533240,that isn't the issue
1616533247,the issue you cant fucking buy it because of the damn queue system
1616533268,I'm thinking of buying like 2k but if it turns out to be a shit coin that would wreck me
1616533283,"Okay but with the queue system,"
1616533292,I mean the option 3 buy in is in 3 days or something
1616533300,"So if I register now with coinlink,"
1616533311,"Set up my account etc and transfer some btc,"
1616533324,Then in 3 days I should be able to buy right?
1616533338,ull have around a 20% to get it
1616533339,even with all the prep done
1616533347,u enter a queue in the hour before the sale goes live
1616533358,"after that hr, everyone in the queue gets assigned a random number"
1616533366,"when its ur turn, you can buy"
1616533378,"if you didnt pre queue, you enter after everyone who did prequeue"
1616533381,i was prequeued
1616533388,i was at 41k
1616533394,I was 48K
1616533395,coin sold out at 17k for me
1616533396,i didn't get any
1616533402,there were over 100k in the queue
1616533415,"in otherwords, only the first 24k ish people"
1616533418,got to buy
1616533462,Sounds quite different from :aga: who has just a little over 100 followers on Facebook and requires people who join tonight to promote them on Twitter
1616533488,"and use a 'free form filling' website, typo in the email subject, interesting prices at around 8:00pm UTC"
1616533493,I’ve managed to get some.  Suppose it will be 8% after one year interest. I’ll give some here to chat guys 🙂 to “nice ones” 🙂 who didn’t. Get any. As thabk to this chat I got to know about it. 🙂 if it will do well of course.
1616533515,I left at Twitter thing.
1616533593,"@raven 🥚  @That one belgian super cunt  thanks,"
1616533612,But what if I'm ready 2 hours before or something?
1616533618,doesnt matter
1616533637,@TheOne  are you saying you only think Casper will go up 8% in 1 year?
1616533637,U need to log in 23:00 gmt /uTc
1616533646,U will get random allocation
1616533667,They give 8% for holding it for a year. Option 1
1616533679,"Oh,"
1616533686,What about price predictions though
1616533703,"I mean won't it get listed on Binance etc,"
1616533704,"Twitter thing is odd, agreed, but nonetheless AGA seems like a really nice coin"
1616533705,Also not sure how places worked. I was like 17k but friend in Spain was 8k+ and we got in maybe 10 min a part.
1616533718,i would say that in 18 months time
1616533728,cspr could be worth about 90c
1616533742,"Okay,"
1616533745,if you had option 1
1616533746,I wish /)
1616533757,you get 8% on top of the raw value
1616533772,90c from 1.5 would be great with my 200 usd beg 🙂
1616533773,And what is the option 3 buy in price?
1616533783,0.3 purcahse price
1616533786,"I think if I don't get Casper Option 3, I'll wait for exchange listing - most of the time they peak, then drop around entry price anyway"
1616533788,op 1 was 0.15
1616533790,0.3 cent a
1616533796,Lmao whatever happened to enj hitting $3
1616533799,Such a shitcoin
1616533815,Suppose to be 6..
1616533827,Where did the enj shills go?
1616533827,WTF is BTC doing
1616533827,It will be but question is when ..
1616533835,y'all are stressed about AGA
1616533838,BTC is gay
1616533854,left because we arent elightened enough
1616533858,Sold it with loss but if not I’d be even in more loss. I’ve recovers lost with DeNT yesterday. It was on drugs lol
1616533866,Did cryptoknight commit sepuku yet?
1616533867,Don’t summon them
1616533890,I will work on getting the twitter mention removed.  Every crypto that does a pre-sale requires this but I will try and change it
1616533909,Im@not 🙂  I don’t get any. 🙂 have my XYl and now some Casper
1616533927,what do you mean?
1616533958,i have not seen a crypto presale that does this
1616533966,what shitcoins are you looking at
1616533967,lmao
1616533979,"have you heard of FRM, PAID, BSCPAD, DUCKDAO, YF-DAI?"
1616533993,every coin they promote for pre-sale you ahve to mention the token
1616534033,But I will try and get the twitter mention deleted
1616534038,no i literally have not heard of any of these
1616534070,so after today I really see why people hate on ETH
1616534087,Okay so @raven you're saying that you think Casper will go up 3x in price in 1 year possibly?
1616534094,fuck ETH
1616534096,fuck BTC
1616534098,seems safe to me
1616534103,ty ricj
1616534105,cultured
1616534117,"I mean I was hoping it would be way more, like what ALICE did"
1616534124,when will good altcoins take over this fucking damned market
1616534126,Like 2000% increase
1616534131,fucked btc is eatign shit 24/7
1616534138,"LTC and NANO are following nearly the same pattern. Same dip , same rise. Interesting."
1616534143,0.90 is more than x3 😎
1616534148,brother if ur looking for 2000% increase go bet everything on black
1616534151,20 times
1616534165,actually that math doesnt work
1616534170,go buy a lottery ticket
1616534199,FRM went from 3 cents to 90 cents
1616534203,Duckdao 100x
1616534209,BSCpad 200x
1616534219,and how many icos have tucked tale and ran with the money
1616534235,These projects are the ones that bring ICO's to market
1616534242,FRM has had 7 all done 5-50x
1616534247,have you heard of BONDLY?
1616534269,In any case. No worries. If anyone needs some help buying AGA I am here to make that process easier
1616534291,@Shivr26 Did you successfully send money to AGA with low fees?
1616534323,the point is. we are investing. 10% a year is *good*
1616534331,The sale is on for 7 days. Wait until 11pm eastern
1616534335,fees are much lower
1616534342,"if you want gains like 20k%, this isnt the place for you. not quickly anyway"
1616534343,to send USDT to a metamask wallet is $20 off an exchange
1616534345,maybe over 10 years
1616534346,sure
1616534352,are you one of the devs at AGA?
1616534361,and then 20$ to send to to AGA address
1616534365,whats your connection to AGA?
1616534389,He is AGA 🤣
1616534403,AGA ga ga ga 😎
1616534417,Yea I am the CEO's right hand man
1616534463,Why is that? Why are fees lower when Americans sleep?!?
1616534485,Defiantly remove Twitter as it smelled like scam to me. Promote us on Twitter or u can’t buy it. I see one sale like that no Twitter no telegram no sale.
1616534488,Well they’re not awake to make BTC fucking tank like they always do
1616534518,Done.  TYPE ANYTHING in the field for twitter and you go to next question
1616534529,no idea lol
1616534620,https://ethereumprice.org/gas/
1616534621,Yes $40
1616534631,Does anyone understand what’s happening with BTC recently?:(
1616534647,it being a shitcoin run by the ultra rich
1616534655,It got tired climbing up 🧗‍♂️
1616534659,Will it ever get back on track:(
1616534667,This site is good for gasprice checking @SeineJanie
1616534716,yes
1616534728,"thx, I know"
1616534769,I spent $40 to send money from Binance to metamask and then send to AGA address
1616534863,When arriving at the 'twitter' part of the form that no one likes just enter in anything and hit enter and it will go to next step
1616534890,please DM if anyone needs help.  tty guys soon
1616534960,so who successfully bought AGA tonight then?
1616534990,
1616535000,ada creating higher lows
1616535035,if we break below $1.08 we'll most likely see it touching the $1 range
1616535085,I ducked out on the advice/aid of @Shivr26
1616535104,Just clawing some money back from meta now
1616535106,Well on the advice that you shouldn't buy AGA with less than $500
1616535111,Damned gas fees lol
1616535150,"Correct, warrants reheating"
1616535157,Repeating *
1616535164,yes sir
1616535198,It’s scaring me a bit 😂 I don’t want the bear market to come sooner :p
1616535242,Shoulda taken profits and used them to buy some bear skin boots to scare the bears away
1616535322,I’m not good at spotting the whole ‘ah BTC’s crashing selllllll’ :kekw:
1616535348,"SXP up next,, see u soon 🚀"
1616535647,must not paper hands akro
1616535650,must not
1616535827,"i plan to hold.. not sure its good idea or not, but I set my sale order at 0.50 lol"
1616536377,And my eth is on swissborg for the staking :chad:
1616536431,What did we learn today? ETH is shit
1616536459,$AGA will be on Binance Smart Chain soon so hopefully then it’ll be much easier to get
1616536471,strong agree
1616536577,"today wasn't a total failure though, made some great chicken wings"
1616536585,Why didnt they just wait for this when they are on bcs :kekw:
1616536585,i mean
1616536588,ETH has always been kinda shit
1616536593,I plan to do same once I get some ETH
1616536600,except when it was new i guess
1616536606,the fees are crazy
1616536614,I hope ETH 2.0 fixes this
1616536632,i feel like
1616536641,if the coin doesnt transfer fast and cheap
1616536648,it should be dead
1616536652,like
1616536654,we have nano
1616536658,that should be the standard
1616536683,the point of crypto is to kinda be a better currency
1616536695,with btc and eth being slower and more expensive
1616536700,kinda goes against that
1616536715,(at least for smaller transfers anyway)
1616536735,i like how BTC maxis keep on screaming decentralised currency
1616536737,bullshit
1616536749,BTC's value and market is in the hands of billionaires and companies
1616536761,mining is nearly half in china
1616536774,we got mining operations so big they can casually dump thousands of BTC
1616536923,yeah I mean BTC is only big because of its name
1616536928,the tech is crap
1616537130,"Spend 15 dollars to send less than 10 dollars, then wait 3 hours for it to confirm once"
1616537222,Wasnt matic fee free for aga ?
1616537514,"Bitcoin is high because it was first, but the higher it goes, the more mainstream it gets, the Alts follow and have more time to shine"
1616537531,"Once crypto is mainstream, that is when other more efficient/cheaper coins will take over"
1616537553,"Bitcoin is King, for now"
1616537595,it depends on mainstream media
1616537609,if the media keeps talking about say NANO as a cheap quick better solution to bitcoin
1616537617,then coin X will get more and more mainstream
1616537618,"Because of it’s name. I hope one day ETH will surpass it, even though I hate ETH just as much."
1616537658,"Wont happen. I bet you that a bunch of boomers dont even know there is something called altcoin, they think BTC is the only crypto"
1616537663,"Oh yeah, boomers don't get that they are separate"
1616537666,My parents are a prime example
1616537669,"""it's that bitcoin"""
1616537685,Like all games consoles are Nintendo
1616537686,that is why clever titling works
1616537695,Get rid of the dinosaurs
1616537706,im glad im not the only that values the name *alot*
1616537712,bitcoin is like objectively
1616537714,only solution is to kill all boomers
1616537716,the best name a crypto can have
1616537720,its actually perfect
1616537723,Happy with that
1616537723,That’s true
1616537729,ok zoomer
1616537731,and i hate it
1616537756,Boom coin®
1616537777,BoomR™
1616537802,Like Grindr but for old people
1616537807,Is this why Sweden lets covid roam free?
1616537826,"amen, we are all BTC haters"
1616537855,I'm quite a bitcoin lover
1616537865,I'll take the hate
1616537872,I'm a realist though
1616537877,It'll make me money
1616537891,I'll be holding for a long time
1616537895,But not forever
1616537932,The point I can sell to fiat and live a comfortable life never having to work again. I'm taking it
1616537963,You released corona virus didnt you
1616537969,🤣
1616537991,I honestly think I brought it to Sweden in jan 2020
1616538019,Who were you trying to kill that time?
1616538066,probably all the 10 million that live here
1616538103,Sounds about right 🤣
1616538716,😔
1616538733,Ohhh
1616538736,Not you floppy
1616538741,You are great
1616538746,Hi
1616538758,heart_eyes:
1616538764,Fucked it
1616538779,What can I do If the gobernance of my country wanna tax the cryotocurrency ?
1616538783,In my heart you nailed it
1616538792,Never sell
1616538797,Maybe a vpn or what dex isms nice?
1616538821,Why bro
1616538841,Can't tax if you don't sell
1616538848,Just hold
1616538852,"You can always evade, which I would not recommend"
1616538857,Few years you might get a less shit gov
1616538896,"Yeah don't evade, you only get to evade tax if you are super rich"
1616538920,Any law that's punishment is a fine is just a law for poor people
1616538968,How about getting a Binance card and just spending it?
1616539051,Binance share the data with the shitty gov if They're ask for it.
1616539071,Cex are nice but not too much
1616539137,Try purse.io. You can buy stuff from Amazon with Bitcoin
1616539140,Anonymously
1616539156,"If you have a lot, you can buy physical gold and then sell it locally."

1616541127,"This is not my graph, I found it on Twitter - I wondering whether anyone who is familiar with TA could take a quick look at this prediction for me, and to help me establish if this prediction is accurate based from the graph drawings or whether it’s just another ‘ahh it’s gonna go high just buy now’ and that it probably won’t go that high - I would appreciate it a lot if someone could give me their views on it <33"

1616546069,Trueee
1616546076,You just gotta sell and buy it back really fast
1616546079,But if u took it from a wallet
1616546079,then it pumps 😉
1616546085,Into an exchange
1616546092,Would that pump?
1616546093,one of the classic burdens

1616546153,"1,121 on ETH and 36,500 on BTC cause I am running cross"

1616547648,And now you do what they told ya?
1616547665,who you talking to lad
1616547680,Cant be below 53k?!? 👀
1616547680,"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me"
1616547722,Killing in the name of 😆 😆
1616547740,we'll find out within the next 6 hours

1616547799,"If eth goes below 1650, eth will fall"
1616548019,lets just make sure that doesnt happen then
1616548040,Everyone pump BTC 😂 Gotta get those numbers up so everything goes green
1616548071,"If you can convince every single person in the world to donate 1$ to the btc fund, we can launch btc to the moon"
1616552718,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1616555538,"No, that would maybe put btc back in the ~60k dollar range unironically"
1616555560,As btc has roughly 1/3 of the total market cap of all crypto
1616556921,"And once again, ENJ shines"
1616557242,Things are turning green
1616560312,is there a wallet that can hold any coin
1616560390,I want to buy some low cap coins but can't get regular binance
1616562146,@Blake2202 binance.com + vpn
1616562725,ENJ is likely done falling
1616562960,"made 400$ selling enj to early before i sleep, i wake up could have made 3k selling at 2.47 i was waiting for this pump 3 days :kekw: :kekw: :kekw:"
1616563133,"I had a limit order at $2 earlier today, and it never filled. I should have just bought it when it was $2.06 x.x"
1616563177,
1616563179,oof
1616563196,fml
1616563196,always put a little above or below a psychological level
1616563299,@Romeeeo can't I get banned and lose everything if the vpn glitches or something
1616563366,"No. if the VPN disconnects it will not allow u to sell or buy but if u enable it, everything works smoothly @Blake2202"
1616563385,thus no need to worry about the VPN disconnecting you
1616563398,You think DGB will continue to drop?
1616563424,"Thanks, will it allow me to trade with leverage?"
1616563454,Because I assume i need to give them my id
1616563492,"No, you can do futures etc without id"
1616563503,afaik only thing verifying id does is increase withdrawal limit
1616563584,"On kucoin you need Id to trade past 20x, idk about binance but at some point theyd ask for an id, right?"
1616563620,Or link my phone to the us
1616563711,nah they dont
1616563753,You know from experience? I havent spoken to anyone who has actually risked it
1616563757,Anything past 10x is too risky for me 😱
1616563762,Yes
1616563801,Do the higher multitudes mean they liquidate faster?
1616563809,yes
1616563810,Yep
1616563814,Ahh
1616563900,"Since I’m not a pro, I don’t really deal with futures unless the stars are aligned anyway. Like 95% of people end up losing money."
1616563990,"Still, is it really foolproof to just vpn and use binance? I don't want to lose everything because I get banned"
1616564026,yes
1616564029,lmao
1616564034,yes bro they will ban and steal ur fund
1616564039,🤣
1616564047,"wont happen, dw"
1616564074,worst case they would implement is probably forcing you to withdraw but thats not a thing
1616564088,they wouldnt straight up tell you to bug off and take your money
1616564097,"but again, binance doesnt really care"
1616564109,"no vpn = warning message, just re-enable and continue using site"
1616564136,"I’m 99% sure if you get on Binance from the US without your VPN up, they’ll want to close your account."
1616564156,"In fact I know they will, I know someone that happened to."
1616564176,How do US people with VPN complete KYC?
1616564204,"And yeah they’ll force you to withdraw, which isn’t a huge issue unless you’re in some shit like THOR"
1616564222,"I have tried to sell and left my VPN off, it told me to use binance.us. when i re-enabled everything works fine @BuffWanderer"
1616564227,"You don’t have to, the whole point is trading from the US without US trading requirements."
1616564228,so there could be more than one factor
1616564245,but i was never forced to withdraw anything yet
1616564317,What vpn do you use?
1616564342,"Yeah, that’s the entire reason for Binance.us"
1616564342,Just to clarify the worst possible outcome is I'm forced to withdraw
1616564357,"Ah I gotcha. The person I’m talking about was in THOR and was being forced to withdraw, only problem being almost no one (definitely no US exchanges) carried THOR."
1616564360,yes
1616564373,if u are paranoid something like mullvad works
1616564377,with the killswitch
1616564395,"also, u only really need VPN when you are buying and selling. thats when it may give an error if not on VPN"
1616564396,"But Binance.US has very limited options compared to Binance. Comparatively, it sucks."
1616564401,binance.us is a joke
1616564401,lol
1616564416,maybe good for some US normies wanting to hold a bit of btc/eth
1616564417,Afaik
1616564423,not for trading
1616564459,this is the entire /BTC market on binance us
1616564460,:kekw:
1616564462,thats it
1616564482,🇺🇸
1616564493,I wonder why they don’t have more options tbh
1616564510,too much regulation
1616564521,some states getting into crypto is so hard
1616564521,Several factors. A lot of people don’t know that Binance and Binance.US are run by totally separate companies.
1616564554,If you live in NY it’s basically go fuck yourself.
1616564594,Like south korea... I just read one of their exchanges is closing in april because of too much regulation
1616564596,yea i see that on a lot of sites even coinbase
1616564600,*Excludes New York
1616564602,:kekw:
1616564609,no point getting it formally
1616564671,rightfully so
1616564675,no federal backing
1616564696,no hedge fund manager(s) and corrupt politicians to ensure the legitimacy of the security
1616564714,Wild wild west
1616564729,you can make a coin with a low market cap and essentially create a spring of money

1616564780,"If / when usdt (too big to fail) crashes in on itself, I wouldn't be suprised if most first world countries shucked cryptocurrencies all together"
1616564837,USDT is a flawed concept anyways.
1616564877,wym anyways
1616564884,"more than an ""anyways"""
1616564892,its BTC's own money printer
1616564911,"US dollar is the farthest thing from stable, a coin backed by a physical supply of a nonstable asset is hardly a stablecoin."
1616564936,sometimes I think CZ knowingly tweets all this fluffy and positive ICO stuff in order to squeeze all the money out of Binance before usdt/pairs explode
1616564958,The volatility of the US dollar doesn't matter because there is nothing to compare it too.
1616564983,Incestuous Alabama residents won't voluntarily look at a forex chart
1616565002,"You’re comparing it in trading pairs, no?"
1616565004,"USDT SAYS its backed by a physical supply, but is not. That is the problem"
1616565086,Easy to say when you’re not a European working for a US company and then Trump tweets something idiotic and your salary goes down by  400€ right before the pay day

1616565144,Oil/USD supremacy Babyyyyy
1616565170,I've heard of the same problem Pre-Euro
1616565182,paying your debts in a neighboring countries' more valuable currency
1616565198,only to have that currency crash and your mortgage increase by 30%
1616565233,Seems like the problem is fiat.
1616565262,Eventually the world will sink into cryptocurrency
1616565267,most likely centralized
1616565292,Love the fanfare of the word “sink” there lol
1616565313,I think BTC and things like ETH will remain nothing more but a hodgepodge of security/currency alternatives
1616565315,Crypto (at least BTC) really isn’t that volatile compared to fiat
1616565336,Currency trading has gone on hundreds of years
1616565336,@JLeh22 its very volatile compared to USD
1616565345,because USD is globally accepted
1616565364,Hard disagree. One tweet from Elon and you get a several thousand dollar jump.
1616565368,Sure. But it’s 10 years old
1616565375,eventually
1616565382,BTC/ETH might become massive
1616565390,as long as people profess interest in it
1616565399,and the volatility will decrease as the market cap increases
1616565413,And compared to stock market I don’t consider crypto volatile at all
1616565414,"thats why a ""BTC 100K END OF YEAR"" prediction is always off"
1616565431,Crypto is incredibly volatile compared to the stock market :/
1616565438,which makes it good and bad
1616565457,"but hey, as long as theres a merchant that transfers my security into usable currency, im good"
1616565486,I can see paying for services and goods through BTC illegal in the next decades.. A means to avoid taxes
1616565498,"it would probably get a bad wrap from the media with no one standing up for it, just like it is now"
1616565525,Crypto is also a lot more flexible than stocks especially with perpetual contracts. I just made 100% ROE within a few hours on a 10x LUNA
1616565537,@Jeremyfto which is absurd
1616565539,like ABSURD
1616565553,imagine running a hedge fund
1616565565,with 10% weekly gains
1616565575,Agreed. Perpetual is something you just cant do with stocks unfortunately
1616565578,"No reason to make it illegal. You can trace BTC payments and charge taxes to the individual owning the wallet. Of course, you’d have to establish ownership of wallets, but by banning it outright they’d miss out on some extra cash flow."
1616565579,They are too slow
1616565608,>Send BTC to binance
1616565615,>FED asks for owner of Binance account

1616565645,"Wait hold on, explain that last line?"
1616565654,I haven’t heard this.
1616565659,BINANCE GLOBAL is not legal in the US
1616565663,you need a vpn to access it
1616565679,"and in some cases, I have heard of Binance shutting down accounts with two weeks notice when being logged in from a US IP"
1616565687,"Well shit most other countries don’t care as much about taxes, I thought we were talking US taxes."
1616565708,we essentially are at the mercy of CZ because of how decentralized and privatized Cryptocurrency is

1616566250,that is the question

1616566382,DOGE went +800% because of a Reddit post.
1616566462,And lose as much.

1616566479,no federal bailout if I buy the top of doge 😦

1616566488,guess Ill just disappear into the night
1616566493,then again
1616566512,I don't think the boomers need to know nor should they care about the .1 garbage cans
1616566520,"The MLKS, PNTS, SKYs, etc"
1616566542,"Only invest what you can lose, DYOR, etc. You can trade responsibly and still make massive money."
1616566543,Then it doesn't mean that it's stupid money for absolutely no ducking good reason.
1616566552,"as long as the government hounds the company or corporate entity that provides the capital gains, and makes sure they are legitimate, it should be satisfactory"

1616566579,>doge hedge fund
1616566584,is there a $cat
1616566584,That’s not what I’m saying though. You can make 800% gains from a Reddit post. That to me is no good reason.

1616566764,Fair enough. Then I think you get into the speculative nature of the market vs any value ascribed via use case.

1616569963,Like 60k $ or 1.some Btc

1616570367,lol
1616570507,"So if it's retained as Bitcoin, what exactly are they going to do with it?"
1616570529,Hodl and wait for it to double and triple
1616570779,"But I'm wondering in terms of cash flow. Businesses have expenses and Tesla's no different. Obviously not many people will buy Teslas with Bitcoin to start with, but if it becomes more common then they'll be sitting on Bitcoin with less cash flowing through the company"
1616570818,"They can always sell some of it, or use it for trading"
1616570900,Does anyone hold stpt?
1616570959,"If they can get some of their suppliers to accept bitcoin, Tesla could end up doing  for crypto what they did for electric cars"

1616572178,Get ready boyz
1616572192,The enjin army is about to show up 😂
1616572230,"eyes on matic, might be breaking out of its downward trend line soon. if it does, new ath is likely"
1616572267,"I think they'll know what they do. It's not that much different to taking payments in USD, EUR, INR, CNY or any other currencies. Companies hedge against volatile currencies. Or they could see Bitcoin as a company investment asset. Either way, it's not gonna be that big of a deal and restrict their USD cashflow at all imo."
1616572332,I haven’t watch the MATIC chart in a while
1616572370,"yeah it's been consolidating since the coinbase listing, been almost 3 weeks now. it might be ready to make a move soon"
1616572386,it followed btc today and retained the growth very well
1616572537,I’m really tempted
1616572579,"please keep in mind, whenever btc dips, matic does too, in 100% of the cases"
1616572584,it's very much btc's bitch
1616572588,Yeah
1616572595,"so in order to trade matic specifically, btc tab is required"
1616572599,so far so good
1616572600,Btc is currently up thanks to Elon
1616572606,That’s what worries me
1616572624,"if you compare btc and matic chart right now tho, matic continues to grow"
1616572629,I think the momentum has been found for it
1616572638,and it's ignoring btc's red candles
1616572647,Everything is growing
1616572647,which is why I think it's ready
1616572654,because it's not dependant on btc atm
1616572660,Cause btc is stable atm
1616572835,it's really going that mf
1616572854,4h candle closed bullish as fuck

1616573075,"it's ok, it likely won't have such a sustained growth and take a break soon"
1616573081,so we can enter there

1616595781,Daaayuumm!!
1616595797,I will push to Senior then
1616595884,I havent touched the pre pumps since i stopped doing pumps

1616596047,just want to send you a virtual hug my guy
1616596104,it has been in #🎓post-grads-podium for like a week ❤️
1616596111,Thoughts on PUNDI?
1616596142,Looks like it’s going
1616596213,ORN will launch trading plateforme the 31th
1616596224,if u want to support
1616596254,Uhhh
1616596266,Aslong the fees are not insane I will support!
1616596293,Coinbase was horrible with the fees
1616596430,they are super low on both Binance & Kucoin
1616596452,when will uniswap v3 be released?
1616596590,also have you guys seen MINA?
1616596818,Is coin base significantly higher?
1616596836,Coinbase is the lord of fees
1616596869,May I ask what u would recommend to use?
1616596872,Coinbase is a scam
1616596874,Binance tbh
1616596915,Binance for sure.
1616596934,Phew was close to buying on cb already
1616596936,Thanks guys
1616596970,if you're from US make sure to use a VPN
1616596982,Living in Germany though
1616597002,Is it for me ?:))
1616597008,Still why the vpn? Tax reasons or?
1616597012,Enjoy your Döner and not having to use a VPN then 😉
1616597018,pretty sure it wasn't you
1616597037,"just checked, it was @alecaviglione"
1616597039,"idk, illegal in the US. They have weird crypto laws"
1616597056,Lol pepegas
1616597070,Lol we can share a hug as I’ve mentioned it too lol  but it’s ok he can have a hug. I’ll get next 🤣
1616597080,Will get one right after work!
1616597091,It’s because the us sucks
1616597104,And a crypto isn’t allowed there if it doesn’t have a holding there or some shit
1616597106,lucky as fuck
1616597111,Which is a hassle for a decentralized currency
1616597133,"your government just wants to know everything, that's why"
1616597139,Luckily
1616597143,I live in the Netherlands
1616597150,So I don’t need a vpn
1616597267,Implying european governments arent tracking everything :kekw:
1616597281,Ankr go fire. I told u all. And now . gonna make the last wave and go to moon
1616597357,I cant send images
1616597382,"Sweden being the worst atm, they just passed a law where they can remotely view your phone without you even being suspicious of a crime"
1616597436,wtf :kekw:  That's what happens when you keep moderaterna in power for too long. Should have voted piratpartiet 😛
1616597443,Alanox allow outside emotes
1616597452,Otherwise I can’t post perfect reactions with Nitro
1616597488,I did vote piratpartiet amigo
1616597499,in #🍆frat-chat we do ❤️
1616597513,We have one here too
1616597522,But our entire government is ass backwards
1616597527,PP only got like 2% votes last time lol
1616597529,Piratenpartij
1616597543,they wanna make weed legal here too
1616597558,"You lied to me, I can’t post external emoji"
1616597563,Maybe if you support a larger party like Centerpartiet next time? Are they good enough?
1616597629,"In Sweden it honestly doesn't matter who you vote, the parties build alliances anyway and it turns into 2 blocks, red & blue"
1616597678,"That's how it is in most countries, but the smaller parties who are necessary for a block to have a majority can have an unproportionally large influence."
1616597702,"Center is not even center, they are right-wing as hell"
1616597710,In Italy they do the same and it’s a mess
1616597764,The liberal party in Norway has like 4% but got the government coalition of a conservative party and an even more conservative party to decriminalise drugs. :kekw:  Legalisation next 💪
1616597852,"Tell me about it, we have uhhh.... 17 parties here"
1616597859,That are all in parliament and voting
1616597872,And they keep struggling to make a coalition
1616597932,i am new to crpyto but am i able to pankcake swap with a linked trustwallet ETHER to BNB
1616597965,Same in Italy
1616597995,Left and right end uo together
1616598003,And they last 6 months
1616598016,Cause how are they supposed to work together?
1616598505,any thoughts in ENJ... classic break and retest kind of thing?
1616598626,I think it would be difficult for it to break the previous price point
1616598759,OST can be good
1616598765,really low marketcap
1616598768,low price
1616598778,and on binance
1616598877,isnt that just another shitcoin?
1616598886,i think yes
1616598901,but nowaydays who care about shitcoins
1616598904,we just want money
1616598938,We love shitcoins
1616598943,be wary of high volatility tho
1616598958,yeah sell limit ready
1616599019,Is this a shit attempt?
1616599029,"Not sure how correct it is, if not, please beat me up"
1616599370,You mean low or high?
1616600099,ada depressing me haha
1616600204,u just need to breath through it till april 🙂
1616600212,im trying to learn ignore deeps..:)
1616600241,"I am, just so close to my overall target for my 1st 6 months"
1616600457,bear through it
1616600561,@Jeremyfto @Sausage Destroyer someone can take a look about $OVR ?
1616600881,Im on the road rn. Sorry mate
1616601010,fair enough
1616601013,at least its not gambling
1616601117,The Kucoin trading bot seems really promising tbh
1616601124,but its kucoin 🤮
1616601130,this
1616601149,I will look into their bots after they learn how to correctly string a sentence together
1616601223,"lmao noticed that too, it's kind of hard to trust them when they can't even spell"
1616601244,I feel like crypto is a huge bubble
1616601259,not the technology
1616601263,blockchain is revolutionary
1616601280,"So what does everyone think about the coinbase pro listing of **ANKR, CRV, STORJ** tomorrow? Are they pumped up enough to do an instant dive like ADA did?"
1616601292,im so shit at it
1616601292,ofcourse its a bubble
1616601299,there are no assets behind it with value :p
1616601309,thats not why its a bubble
1616601313,Didn't they already list ANKR?
1616601321,@kittiewitty have you heard of the US dollar?
1616601324,maybe the yuan?
1616601327,or british pound?
1616601332,"They announced all 3 and you can transfer them to coinbase, but trading starts tomorrow"
1616601340,currency has value because the people that USE the currency say it has value
1616601342,cryptos arent currency
1616601349,XLM
1616601356,then why is it called cryptocurrency 🤓
1616601374,"its not because you call it that, that it is that"
1616601405,I don't call it cryptocurrency
1616601409,if we say that we have marblecurrency
1616601409,"The last listing of 3 minor currencies 2 weeks ago led to an increase for all 3, but they were not as pumped up since the announcement as ADA was. Now everyone is pumping the new ones like ADA."
1616601412,and we pay each other in it
1616601413,the financial world calls it cryptocurrency
1616601423,Ankr get listed tomorrow ? Price will go up 🙂
1616601433,Need to sale in time /)
1616601449,stop arguing with me im right :dababy:
1616601485,comparing bitcoin with USD is a step to far for me :p
1616601493,"If it behaves like ADA, the best time to sell will be ~5min before trading starts. If it behaves like SKL, MATIC or SUSHI, the best time to sell will be once trading starts on coinbase regular or even later"
1616601521,Ada didnt do anything on regular coinbase listing
1616601529,and ANKR pro coinbase was yesterday no?
1616601536,or was it the announcement
1616601563,"it went up by 4 cent, and then continued to go back down"
1616601583,yea ok thats something I guess :p
1616601614,Ada likes to tease
1616601623,It's a grower not a shower
1616601652,It's mainly running on hype atm so just wait for a major event
1616601694,"you mean for a major announcement that starts pumping up a hype bubble. Once the actual event happens, the bubble bursts :kekw:"
1616601759,Don't strawman me
1616601771,@Sultan lets use brains here
1616601780,ankr and storj have been pumped like crazy
1616601787,I mean wait till we get close to a major event to start trading it
1616601790,ada didn't pump during listing
1616601800,and if any crypto was to pump during a coinbase listing it would be ada
1616601803,Dont buy it during an event
1616601807,When the funding fee is in the negatives
1616601817,the only one that hasn't pumped is CRV
1616601833,so if you are betting on an increase from the coinbase release I think CRV is best bet
1616601851,I'm talking about gogeun..
1616601898,Also ada dropped to $1 and bounced back up to its ath at the coinbase listing announcement
1616601904,It started to pump a lot the second the listing was announced. Then it took a massive dive when the listing happened.
1616601946,it went up like .0001 %
1616601948,very minor
1616601976,"Please, take our LUNAs! We have too many of them!!!"
1616602011,"ADA was overhyped to begin with, though. It's the ENJ before ENJ."
1616602016,Are we looking at the same charts? What time frame are u talking about
1616602020,To many people shorting. Gotta love it
1616602057,I got in so low that my position is green too so double paid￼
1616602127,woop woop
1616602211,
1616602229,@BASED? 46% in 2 days
1616602301,yea
1616602305,like 3%
1616602310,:kekw:
1616602317,So when is ada going to go up again
1616602326,Cause full decentralization is 31st
1616602330,I know that
1616602385,Did you forget ada going from 1.02 to nearly ath during the build up to coinbase pro?
1616602429,when I gripe about ada pumping 3% - .00001
1616602433,You shoulda told me ur retarded before we started this conversation
1616602447,im comparing it to releases like AAVE on coinbase
1616602468,`VIA: New peak at 1902 sats! Gained 27.39% from entry @ 1493 sats`
1616602470,wasn't/isn't uncommon to see a currency jump 1000% in a week
1616602477,: )
1616602544,>ADA is top 10 in market cap
1616602546,Okay
1616602547,"That's not even right, I bought my current stash around 1200 sats. 1493 is the last stop-loss"
1616602571,isn't it like 4th?
1616602585,USDT BTC ETH BNB ADA
1616602586,3rd I believe
1616602592,At peak
1616602594,BNB and ADA fighting for 3rd place
1616602829,"VIA is going into overbought territory now though, I expect a correction soon"
1616602984,Will it reach 2000 sats? 😉
1616603041,
1616603042,Me rn
1616603249,Buy STORMx
1616603284,No
1616603350,Say that again
1616603355,No
1616603358,Ima cyber bully you
1616603372,lmaooo
1616603464,I already bought stmx when it was 22 satoshi
1616603617,

1616603803,Coinlist?
1616603941,Why do people say LINK is gonna hit 1k by eoy
1616603943,Seems silly
1616604176,uni
1616604186,people are dreaming
1616604193,they dont even look at the market cap
1616604279,Thats like saying RSR is gonna hit 100$
1616604284,crazy shit
1616604296,I hate these radical shillers
1616604390,ahahah we all were noobies
1616604560,Ouch. Wonder how many people have forever stuck transactions because they messed up their gas
1616604563,If LINK goes to 60$ i’d be more than happy
1616604571,It never goes up
1616604954,I think ONE (harmony) will rich 1 Usd. it keeps climing up. I am thinking to buy some and leave it till like summer. it still 20cents. was 10 just few weeks a go
1616605213,gonna buy the dip in ada again here shortly
1616605228,I doubt it drops below $1 so I’m watching carefully
1616606684,why tf did ENJ bounced 50 cents
1616606759,must've been cryptoknight
1616607420,BTC is looking pretty bullish right now
1616608550,=]
1616608706,anyone in here is seeing this pattern around BTC and most alts
1616608712,that is 3 bottoms
1616608719,and them a move up/down?
1616608753,I mean most of them follow BTC
1616608782,Why tf you guys still following this thing?
1616608798,nah i forgot to shut the futures tab down
1616608805,"Hi everyone, does someone knows where I could find dates of precedent pumps ? 
Thank you 🙂"
1616608806,i just focus on my spot ones
1616608813,Except Belgian... He needs to come back to profitland for a great story to tell.
1616608836,Should we forget about ENJ?
1616608845,I’m also still in it
1616608857,Then don't forget it 😆
1616608876,keep it up lawd
1616608906,But I keep going out and then in
1616608914,It’s like a bad relationship

1616609143,I think he meant past pumps?
1616609157,"There’s at least one almost everyday, it would be quite difficult to track, but it’s something we’re working on"

1616611931,Hows the xrp lawsuit
1616612012,Ripple might not really affect XRP
1616612019,crypto
1616612100,Ah yes thanks I keep forgetting there is  a difference bcs all the articles that say good news for xrp
1616612131,I'm sure there will be some effect but it might be minimal.
1616612666,You are looking a place where you can loos all your assets ?
1616613084,"Analcox, do i need a matic wallet for aga ? Do i need to configure it on metamask ?"
1616613127,"I think now you just need **any** wallet on BSC, ETH *or* Matic network. Whichever you choose."
1616613140,"You can use Trust Wallet, or metamask. MATIC and ERC20 work."
1616613180,Thanks. Trying to avoid erc20 as much as I can ;)
1616613189,yeah who doesn't
1616613202,I spent almost 3 hours yesterday and today trying to avoid $20 gas fees 😄
1616613211,shitty hourly salary if you ask me...
1616613252,"good man, I hate ERC20 after last night"
1616613276,Seems tvere was a mess with polkamon eggs as well
1616613279,On erc20
1616613323,But the main reason is that my wallet is so small that $40 would put a big dent in it 🤣
1616613442,"when it comes to fees, we're all greedy, don't worry"
1616613447,It's like paying for shipping
1616613549,remember to connect MATIC: https://wallet.matic.network/
1616613559,so the best way would be to convert into BUSD
1616613566,and transfer from that way?
1616613635,"yessir, via BSC or BEP20"
1616613643,so BUSD into any wallet that supports bsc. and then from that into aga ?
1616613648,I recommend Trust Wallet
1616613654,trust wallet
1616613657,gotcha
1616613663,yeah as long as u can receive AGA to that same exact address u sent from
1616613681,do i need to do anything specific with trust wallet?
1616613713,all my knowledge is TA basically
1616613742,Yeah will start with that actually
1616613873,if u want matic u gotta connect it
1616613886,im still deciding between matic and eth
1616613913,eth seems easier but fuck eth
1616613980,
1616613994,ETH might be easier but u might have to add the contract into Trust Wallet
1616614023,hold on im doing more matic research
1616614033,if i like it even a smidge ill go with that on principal alone
1616614043,all u have to do is go to that site and scan QR code from trust wallet
1616614055,"and boom, you got your MATIC wallet open."
1616614059,without having to add any contracts.
1616614062,@raven 🥚
1616614064,Hmm do i need to buy 500 aga at least to be of any use ?
1616614068,tyty
1616614086,"no, minimum $100"
1616614101,Yeah but the site itself says
1616614104,500 AGA minimum for AGA Token Liquidity Provided to qualify for Bonus Rewards
1616614116,"who sent me 1 MATIC? lol, thanks"
1616614123,looks better than eth anway
1616614125,ill set that up now
1616614153,let me ask them
1616614198,yea i can absolutely not get 500 AGA
1616614206,that is just for the 24% APY you get for holding
1616614235,you still quality for the 20% bonus. @raven 🥚 & @xclicx
1616614244,cc @Shivr26
1616614245,good enough for me
1616614265,LMAO
1616614325,"you would need to buy 1000 AGA, convert 500 AGA into AGAr and then put them into an LP the 500 AGA and equivalent value AGAr to earn the 24% APR"
1616614341,better off just buying AGA and holding for the bonus then complicate things at this point lol
1616614493,ok
1616614495,trust wallet installed
1616614753,so next i need to setup the MATIC stuff
1616614793,I hold AGA to trade not to stake. 24% per year? Pah! 😄
1616614823,i think ill hold it for a year
1616614828,who knows
1616614832,maybe its worth 10k
1616614842,Or maybe altseason is over in a year
1616614853,and everything has gone to shit except top 20 coins
1616614864,coti has chance to pump

1616625486,"I don’t have a crystal ball, but if I’ve learned anything the last year and a half it’s that now is the time to buy these dips. Profit from your losses."

1616625606,You look at all of it. ADA will have steady growth long-term is what I mean.
1616625615,💯
1616625620,ada is 33 billions market cap
1616625628,i feel like people shit on ada just because they’re emotionally attached to eth
1616625632,to double it have to 66 billions market cap
1616625651,im fking not
1616625656,just look market cap
1616625671,not you specifically. i said most people

1616625862,the battle for 52.7k
1616625865,Hasn’t gone down to that yet
1616625880,idiot
1616625901,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1616625907,i believe in ada more than eth
1616625934,"oh, it *is* going down more"
1616625940,futures?
1616625950,i think
1616625953,"so if you're long, probably better close ... no guarantee though... I mean all it takes is one Elon tweet to fuck up all TA 😄"
1616625956,if someone want to long btc
1616625961,u should do it now
1616625962,52292
1616625971,that's a nice entry
1616625986,all it takes is elon selling his btc...
1616625988,40k inc
1616625990,imagine longing btc 2x and getting liquidated
1616625997,Ya I like it 😄
1616626002,more btc for tesla
1616626010,although I might have over leveraged; Haven't figured out yet
1616626010,if they have it when btc is low
1616626011,im 15x
1616626022,which isnt TOOO bad but its still a little dangerous in these climates
1616626056,good luck man
1616626065,How can it drop lower than this
1616626072,bro its btc
1616626078,dont fucking say that
1616626090,I don't think it will
1616626097,Btc taking a hit atm 😂
1616626107,or at least lower than 51.7k
1616626145,"oh look, 52.5k being fiercely defended by bulls"
1616626146,Dips 😍😍😍
1616626148,Time to buy
1616626179,@SeineJanie same thing happened at 54k tho
1616626183,id love some of everthng lol but no money. all in red lol
1616626196,"yeah, no guarantees"
1616626202,but it's a good sign that there *is* a fight
1616626211,"oops, now going below"
1616626243,btc diping again
1616626398,be carefull🥶
1616626418,im still green
1616626420,why does everyone need to make a point every two mins about btc dipping. like they all go up and down all the time so it just makes me wonder like if people are new and never experienced a dip or what’s the purpose of announcing it so often
1616626440,do you guys think btc is even worth investing in if you don’t have 20k+ to invest?
1616626442,Eh it effects people more when they do leverage calls
1616626448,true
1616626459,You can get liquidated with leverage.Thats why its a big deal
1616626481,Its kind of an accepted fact that BTC is going to recover and keep going up eventually
1616626509,An ending bull-run is still a big deal tho
1616626519,why are you on a crypto discord in the first place? @spacecadet
1616626532,because i invest in crypto?
1616626540,why else would i be here
1616626592,well people just keep an eye on the situtation of btc and you get mad. what else can u get from a crypto discord as an investor expect some people commenting the market
1616626605,i’m not mad at all
1616626620,good 🙂
1616626647,If we close a 4h under 51k we'll most likely greet 47k again
1616626673,"hey we're all experiencing stress because of our leveraged positions, commenting on the current price movement during such substantial and dramatic drops helps us keep us sane, it's a community after all"
1616626689,im breathing through and not looking on my accontas i know its burning.. not much i can do. not saling with -.. so just keep breathing
1616626697,"it's a very important day for btc, whether good or bad, and of course we'll cover it"
1616626717,what are we supposed to do else? talk about ada
1616626718,dead
1616626762,i am in chz at 0.51 with 5k dollars... ok ? 😄
1616626788,which is 100% of my portfolio.. just so we clear 😄
1616626819,yikes
1616626828,"no? i was just saying for the last hour it’s been nothing but the same people repeating that btc is down so i was just stating that if you already said it once why say it again several minutes later, we’re still in the dip. i’m not trying to be an asshole or tell people they can’t say what they want like who tf am i to even say that. i think i’m just being mistaken"
1616626832,"mix your portfolio in many coins, its too risky to keep it in only one (imo)"
1616626847,which seems to happen a lot in this specific server which sucks because a few of you are actually really cool and insightful
1616626861,it was supposed to be going up but then btc decided to get fucked by elon ... 🙂
1616626890,i think a lot of people thought it would steady increase since elon announced the tesla thing
1616626946,but it seems a lot of people are opposing that. like saying that a tesla will depreciate and bitcoin won’t
1616626957,so it’s not a “smart” investment in their opinion
1616627038,
1616627053,if he's still in im still in
1616627063,same
1616627078,I think we're clear of anything below 52k
1616627085,Why is this always around bed time :p
1616627085,Triangle narrowing down
1616627094,we just have to find our way up above 52k now
1616627099,It's the only time I have to play 😄
1616627106,unforrunately bagged up in NPXS but glad to not be in other coins at the moment
1616627115,like ENJ 😂
1616627148,ENJ is doing ok
1616627156,CHR is killing me
1616627176,Every day I think “it can’t go lower”
1616627182,it's fascinating checking out all the altcoins and seeing their performance during this
1616627188,Enj was doing so god damn fine again
1616627200,"some are holding still like champs, some are copy-pastes of btc's chart, and some are dropping way more than the others"
1616627209,

1616627221,breaking out above

1616627239,Aaay Belgian

1616635031,"Lmao and this is why i use trading bots, made buys/sells all the way down and didnt lose shit."
1616635379,If you’re not buying these dips you’re crazy.
1616635468,tell me more about bots 😎
1616635821,You'll have to do that in DMs. Bot promotion is not allowed here unless its one of the verified bots that are listed in #🤖pump-bots
1616635864,Its primarily for liability reasons. We don't want someone promoting a bot we haven't vetted and it end up being something nefarious

1616637671,Hahaha rip your enj
1616637724,Not yet
1616637727,Once they stop dipping yes. Buy now and loose.
1616637744,Not at all.
1616637748,gg
1616637762,It’s impossible to time the dip. Buy smaller amounts all the way down.
1616637785,why would it dump so much right after the tesla news
1616637793,"Maybe $100 of ETH at $1600, then $200 of ETH if it hits $1400."
1616637807,That way you’re not trying to time one big buy and fucking it up.
1616637846,Besides when you’re buying a dip I hope you’re not expecting it to immediately appreciate in value lol.
1616637857,Because btc whales and billionaires are retarded. Probably scared thos is the beginning of the death of fiat so they are dumping
1616637910,My bnb is just sitting still. Ada os 0.89 liq. Enjo 1.75. No way those get hit
1616638013,Hopefullt btc will stop correcting and start a new uptrend oncr the idiots are done abusing good news for dumping

1616639369,Not worth
1616640203,"Lmao, up 4k in my margin account thinking same thing. If you hold more than one coin, the liquidation price means a lot less. If other coins dip you can be liquidated at a much higher price. I could've sold last night but instead I'm left with 300 in my account. Hard lesson for me, I had a feeling but decided to trust the numbers it gave me instead. Don't make the same mistake this is my first big loss and the feeling is not something you want to feel"

1616675225,yeah cant he just say SpaceX will accept BTC for trips to the moon
1616675359,Ouch
1616675378,Wow those liquidations hurt to see
1616675397,where do you see these?
1616675404,that sucks..
1616675534,whats wrong with btc
1616675538,am gonna cry
1616675539,Its btx
1616675541,Btc
1616675544,That is the issue
1616675547,Ok btc wants to test 49k
1616675551,lets give it to him
1616675555,and then we can continue our bullrun
1616675555,Wow. Wonder what's Swiss' liquidation point on his x125
1616675559,but first he needs to test once 49k
1616675562,yeah
1616675640,omg dude
1616675672,any predictions for if the market is gonna continue bearish or reverse to bullish during this weekend?
1616675687,50.3k is daily support level
1616675695,sells sells sells
1616675697,so it may have a harder time going below that
1616675712,it got really close and bounced
1616675730,
1616675738,my millioneire trade
1616675741,reached 50.5k
1616675753,50.178 is where it will bounced if it ever will xD
1616675760,is it 125x?
1616675766,yeah
1616675767,125x ofc
1616675774,brave
1616675794,Crossing my fingers that it doesnt hit 49000. Its not liq for me but its my SL and I really wouldnt like to take an L on this one
1616675797,fib level is like exactly at 50k isn't it?
1616675808,fib?
1616675812,50.3k aligned fib level and daily support
1616675816,fibbonaci sequence
1616675816,so I expect huge bounce there
1616675825,50k is psychological support aswell
1616675829,that too
1616675833,just like 60k psychological resistance
1616675846,"i already heard about it, but how do it work?"
1616675865,idk much about it im still learning as well
1616675885,50.4k
1616675915,Luna said “fuck this dipping shit”. Its higher now than it was when I went to sleep at 52000 btc
1616675932,Who let the bears out
1616675944,Dont look at me. I was asleep
1616675978,Jeremy where is the 2000 eth?
1616675989,lol there is no bears out there
1616675997,if it is you should be looking at
1616675998,39k
1616676004,I never said 2k eth was coming soon lol
1616676027,Most of my positions are mid-long term positions
1616676029,"Yes you said, but I'm too lazy to go search for evidence 😹"
1616676062,I guarantee I never predicted a price on ETH. Iv said what prices I am aiming for
1616676069,But I dont do price predictions
1616676081,Thats how you get burnt out on the market
1616676093,Getting your hopes up for x price by x time
1616676094,can't believe how strong $2 is for enj
1616676102,If it would go to 2000 you would say otherwise
1616676123,Can I just say one thing
1616676130,Imagine you had a position and you payed almost 5k fee and now stop loss triggered
1616676133,Can we kill things like futures
1616676134,Im so pissed
1616676147,That's why I left futures
1616676148,Cause that is the cancer killing crypto
1616676158,The bizarre gambling mechanism that is deleting value
1616676168,Without futures
1616676175,"you have it everywhere, not just in crypto"
1616676176,You would make like 1.2x per month
1616676182,If that satisfies you go stake
1616676191,And with futures you lose 90% in one day
1616676193,Congrats
1616676204,Well I guess you use future to invest money you can’t afford to invest ? @Güneş
1616676211,I made like 2000 in one day on futures
1616676216,Lol i started with 2k down to nothing started again with 1k now i have over 50
1616676219,With only 100 bucks
1616676220,I guarantee I wouldnt have as I never predicted a price to begin with. I would probably send a gif of “its finally done” cause thats prob when im gonna be done with ETH lol
1616676228,The next day I lost it all
1616676228,If you know what you are doing
1616676240,Why so mad?
1616676253,You have a saga and all
1616676265,Im not sure how you took that as mad 🤷‍♂️
1616676268,DO NOT BOUNCE from 50.438
1616676272,GO 50.170 first
1616676274,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1616676275,Eth gonna reach 2k with the next btc bull run which should start soon
1616676298,Imagine you have 1k budget with starting
1616676303,"I bet it will, what matters here is when 😹 😹"
1616676308,And then how many coins can you invest to earn money ?
1616676311,2 ? 3 ? maybe 4 ?
1616676314,"My sega was basically a bet I made. Said if it reached 2k by a different post grads prediction date, I would paint my toe nails green"
1616676315,250 each ? and futures ?
1616676321,you can invest 10-20-30-40-50
1616676330,It didnt reach it in time
1616676372,A lot of ENJINEERS would say that never did predictions too
1616676380,And do you guys know why its dropping not normally because big youtubers i dont want to give names here fudding people about bitcoin dropping hard titles
1616676402,I just invested 5k into ADA at 0.9 eur
1616676404,Fuck yes
1616676418,I dont know why you are trying to strawman me but go ahead and get proof if you think I made a prediction
1616676438,Link the messages where I said it would reach 2k and Ill gladly conceed
1616676441,"Keep calm, don't need to cry"
1616676454,is futures and leverage trading the same thing
1616676458,Lets put things into perspective
1616676460,Good meme mate. Good meme
1616676461,i literally have no clue on either
1616676511,Why my mate is on your pfp?
1616676529,u know diogo jota?!?!
1616676533,I think that 50438 could be considered hitting that daily and fib level. I'd imagine lots of traders would put it slightly above 50.3k to trigger their buys and longs
1616676544,"I think it hit it, and from here we should recover"
1616676555,"He has the same age as me, we both played at gondomar and we went to school togethwr"
1616676566,no fucking way holy shit man
1616676609,"we'll talk abt that later, i sent u friend request"
1616676665,"That would be great because LUNA resisted dipping further meaning if BTC recovers all the way, my LUNA position could turn really sexy really fast"
1616676694,Plus my 15x BTC would appreciate it
1616676704,
1616676725,btc wont recover all the way
1616676741,"def not, it can't just hit a new ath right away"
1616676777,Oh for sure! I meant more of recovery levels from last dip(56-57k). I wasnt very clear on that message
1616676802,I just mean if it doesn’t short change the recovery due to the severity of the dip
1616676806,hrrm
1616676807,we'll see
1616676815,i think investor buy up has slowed
1616676833,they fear elon
1616676838,he is ruining the market
1616676874,
1616676884,Eh rich people in general are. Elon isn’t the only source of manipulation
1616676890,here's the larger picture of the chart
1616676896,But he likely attracted more of them
1616676938,prices may diff cuz it's futures chart
1616676944,"but essentially, it's the same thing"
1616676985,6 billion in futures are expiring tomorrow
1616677020,is that a good or a bad thing?
1616677031,depends on if youre bullish or bearish
1616677040,but could see it drop below 50k
1616677067,depends on how it copes at the lower support and if it can bounce off it
1616677072,Actually it depends on what the divide of longs vs shorts are that are expiring
1616677081,where did you see it?
1616677110,The amount of futures expiring are only relevant when you know how many longs vs how many shorts are expiring
1616677111,
1616677135,coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-brace-for-record-6b-in-options-to-expire-friday
1616677153,Could you say Elon actually made things worse with his Tesla shit? By attracting people to sell in the dip?
1616677165,you talking about yesterday
1616677206,Suddenly elon tweets. Bought one more billion of bitcoin at discount
1616677213,Lol
1616677227,His poor accountant though
1616677234,Yeah that must be horrible
1616677241,btc fell below 1 trillion market cap aswell
1616677267,"I wonder if he just had one accountant for everything, or do you think he has a team of accountants lmao"
1616677271,"So this article is misleading. They say “Short futures positions will be squared off or allowed to expire, and the long positions held in the spot market could be dumped, leading to increased price volatility”"
1616677287,"wish btc dominance would just crap itself already, ugh"
1616677291,tired of it being at 60%
1616677325,If anyone here knows how to hack
1616677327,Please hack bybit
1616677328,They are exclusively talking about a long future dump while trying to ignore the fact that short positions can be dropped as well
1616677331,and we can go all the way up to the 73k
1616677334,bybit is selling %98
1616677339,And they never give the divide of shorts vs longs
1616677363,"i didnt know you could find the divide, ill look that up"
1616677368,i think the max pain stuff is correct though
1616677374,Mostly a layman when it comes to the technology aspect of it but even I recognize BTC aint that special other than its widespread recognition.
1616677381,"Which again, is misleading. A quantity of contracts expiring is only relevant when you have the divide"
1616677385,"damn 
_The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance-DOT value $35.59M_"
1616677400,for sure
1616677409,wtf
1616677427,They are purposely bearish in the article. Even their terminology is bearish. They say “expire” for shorts but they say “dump” for longs
1616677455,The contracts do the same thing when they end. Changing your terminology is attempting to FUD
1616677471,I have 4k liquid.. looking forward to long
1616677479,Not right obviously
1616677489,Right now*
1616677492,good analysis
1616677501,"Bitcoin call options worth $2.6 billion and put options worth $2.8 billion will expire on Friday, March 26."
1616677504,found this in another article
1616677525,but i get what you are saying
1616677529,So 200 million difference
1616677529,Uhhh
1616677532,So not much
1616677534,At all
1616677542,so what happens exactly when they expire
1616677547,and whats the implication
1616677547,Who tf said bitcoin has a 1t market cap
1616677577,Same as perpetual just with a set ending time
1616677592,"If you are above your entry, you make money on longs and lose money on shorts"
1616677612,And vice versa for below entry
1616677674,You dont get daily funding fees like perpetual and you can set the price to whatever you want because its a contract between you and another person meaning someone else has to agree to it
1616677691,Intriguing
1616677699,Want to know whats more intriguing
1616677710,The global crypto market losing 9.73% in 24h
1616677721,So bitcoin *is* pulling the market down literally
1616677733,As it’s only 10.09% 24h atm
1616677744,Bitcoin isnt pulling market down
1616677754,people going to take profits from volatiliy of bitcoin
1616677759,they sell their alts to take position on btc
1616677780,"so when these contracts expire tomorrow though, will there be any kind of reaction in btc price from it do you think?"
1616677789,Last time nothing happened
1616677793,and even bounced more up
1616677850,"Because its so close to balance I dont think it will affect it at all. It may bring it down by a few dollars if it does anything but its only a 200,000,000$ difference"
1616677854,Thats nothing to BTC
1616677929,"There are 6,000,000,000$ worth of contracts expiring and only 200,000,000 difference. Thats how you can put it in perspective on the lacking of severity in this situation"
1616678040,Im not saying it CANT dump more but the expiring contracts wont really effect much.
1616678068,that makes sense
1616678103,Personal prediction: we go under 50k but not under 47k and then I’d expect a huge bounce
1616678123,Followed by a steady rise
1616678137,Im actually thinking of adjusting my btc long from SL 49 to SL 48
1616678142,If you watch the daily
1616678160,I bought more so its worth more to keep the position tbh
1616678192,A similar pattern repeats
1616678198,i doubt it will go below 50k for now
1616678209,this
1616678255,I adjusted my sl to 48000 just in case but I agree. I think 50 is our stopping point
1616678255,I’d like for it to break under 50k
1616678275,I would feel a lot safer opening a big position
1616678284,With a nice leverage
1616678301,yeah everyone would hehe
1616678311,which is why it can't be that predictable and safe
1616678314,because it would be too easy
1616678352,"Im running a 15x’er on BTC rn cause I thought 52000 was the end. My liq is a whole 10k away but yep, no one can predict this stuff super accurately"
1616678385,Yeah i was thinking of a 20x
1616678387,Im not aiming for liq tho. I have a SL in place
1616678405,And I would keep on adding margin if needed
1616678417,https://tenor.com/view/money-burn-cash-shoveling-gif-5348644
1616678428,lmao
1616678430,Keeping the position open
1616678438,Cause i do believe we’ll go to 70k
1616678447,Once this dip is over
1616678476,Oh for sure! Lots of people think this looks like january
1616678481,"In line for the end of March, which everyone has been crazing about"
1616678494,Dip followed by super launch
1616678524,Yeah even tho that was really pushed by Tesla
1616678530,I personally dont give comparison patterns too much weight because of how the market is but still interesting to see
1616678560,The jump from 29k to 58k was huge
1616678579,Btc to 100k by lunch time?!?!? /s lol
1616678590,Already had lunch
1616678596,Imagine tho. The whales all came together
1616678598,BTC easily will hit 100k by EOY
1616678600,Said lets do this thing
1616678600,imo
1616678616,It will also crash before eoy
1616678629,I agree to both statements
1616678652,I don’t think it will take btc 6 months to go to 100k
1616678672,All it needs is one big news
1616678700,Imagine we go to 70k and apple announce they bought 10 billions worth of btc
1616678711,It would go crazy high
1616678726,And probably crash hard too
1616678762,Someone just needs to whale up and get my girl LUNA to my 100$ EOY yolo TP lol
1616678784,40k in my pocket. Enough for the tesla and then some lol
1616678789,Kaleo still thinks BTC could go lower dayum
1616678827,What would the market cap be?
1616678873,($100/current price)x current price x volume
1616678895,I just don’t wanna search honestly 😂
1616678898,"Current market cap is 6,481,979,596$"
1616678906,I mean
1616678912,Ill do the math to figure out 100$ market cap
1616678914,Assume a x7
1616678923,It’s not impossible but...
1616678929,So 100b market cap
1616678935,No
1616678936,Diluted
1616678939,Ah ok
1616678945,That’s a lot 😂
1616678949,Roughly 35-36b undiluted
1616678966,If LUNA gets there imagine the rest of the market
1616678983,We would have a multiple trillions market cap
1616678992,"Its my YOLO and regardless of where its at, ill close at EOY but who knows lol"
1616679003,I get paid to hold the position anyways
1616679010,The funding fees are negative rn
1616679015,lol wtf
1616679017,how does that work
1616679030,Its based on how many shorters vs how many longers
1616679034,There are more shorters rn
1616679049,is this in the perp?
1616679050,So the shorters get feed and the longers get paid the fees
1616679053,Yep
1616679059,of course its in the perp what am i saying
1616679063,couldnt do eoy in quarterly lol
1616679086,But ya I get paid roughly 10$ every 8 hours
1616679100,So 30$ a day
1616679104,"Nice, how much are you in with?"
1616679119,About 800$
1616679135,10x’ing rn
1616679141,What pair?
1616679170,USDT. I dont do CoinM futures.
1616679228,"Oooooh, if btc breaks out of this zone, we will have a moonshot I think"
1616679246,It going
1616679254,That would be amazing. Im sure my friend I got into crypto last night is questioning my sanity lol
1616679257,Dangggg
1616679262,I got her in at 52000
1616679264,Volatility
1616679267,buy it buy it buy itttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

1616679306,ok short now
1616679311,All my red is melting away 🙂

1616679315,close short turn long now
1616679336,ok now close long and turn short once more
1616679346,I only thought about buying
1616679351,And it stopped
1616679360,That’s how puwerful i am
1616679365,Lol
1616679374,ok long now for god sake
1616679381,what's that u talking about Jere?
1616679383,Short
1616679391,no no short from 51.750
1616679396,He's getting paid to keep his position
1616679402,Funding fees in futures
1616679407,Free money lmfao
1616679407,see i know this game
1616679417,ok now close long go short
1616679424,125x short
1616679474,When I FIRST got into futures I did that and would tp every 2$ gain lol. Figured out quickly fees costed more than the gain and I actually lost money on my first few positions even though I ended them all in green lol
1616679523,"Panic sellers, panic buyers. Bitcoin has everyone in panic. What if an institution panic buys now lol"
1616679528,lol only if you registered as a normal member
1616679532,i have %30 bonus fee
1616679562,and if im wrong correct me max you can get is %40
1616679588,close short now and go long once more lmao
1616679597,"Great, how does it works? Could i make it too rn?"
1616679599,"That's bad news, but if you're right with your analysis, that's bonus gain"
1616679647,CHZ/USDT took a big dive since yesterday
1616679648,"Yay, we are back at 52"
1616679680,You just open a position in futures although because things are recovering we will likely go back to positive funding fees soon
1616679717,We are already at -0.05 from the -0.15% we were at yesterday
1616679717,Just read the story about the wife going to her sister cause her husband didn’t sell btc at 60k
1616679728,And he bought more 😂
1616679733,He a savage
1616679748,Sounds like a true chad
1616679761,Wowowow
1616679762,HODL for dear life
1616679762,I can imagine their arguments
1616679776,Alright off to work I go. Please clean up the BTC mess while Im away so I dont SL out of my position lol
1616679793,As soon as btc goes to 70k she’ll be back home
1616679793,We will take it from here
1616679793,48000$. Thats my SL. Keep it away from there lol
1616679809,You are 4k up
1616679811,You are safe
1616679826,Diamond hands holding the line
1616679870,still holding my btc bought at 57k lol
1616679890,should i just sell them and do shorts?
1616679916,What’s happening with ANKR guys? Coin base pro listing in 2 hours
1616679953,No
1616679972,Price is already inflated
1616679972,"Support levels haven't been broken yet, so you'll sell to get liquidated. Been there, done that"
1616680043,"Same with BNB. Those who weren't aware of the burn, ended up in awe with the price spike"
1616680104,Bnb did a burn?
1616680182,ok do you guys want me to save you if i open a short from here
1616680185,we most likely break 52k
1616680196,"but isn't that the same? to hold it on 57 and wait until price goes back, and just sell, buy in the dip and wait the price to go higher?"
1616680214,"im not in futures btw, not yet"

1616680304,Oh boy
1616680489,What does this mean
1616680580,Think it’s futures
1616680583,Liquidated futures
1616680588,That have been liquidated
1616680589,Money goes buuuuuuuurn
1616680598,where do you find that information?
1616680601,@fffffffffffff you’re in there somewhere
1616680623,They’re all mine
1616680663,this is not liqudations

1616680680,you can track from here
1616680726,thanks
1616680857,Binance be earning that transaction fee lambos
1616681229,I've got some coins in Metamask on Ethereum mainnet. Is there any way to exchange them to BSC directly from metamask without paying the huge transaction fees of eth?
1616681261,Nope. Any swap will need to be paid for by eth gas
1616681324,nevermind
1616681348,green = buys red = sells not short or longs
1616681429,😦 ~70$ now... on a 400$ transaction... eth sucks
1616681482,Theta is doing the impossible
1616681560,Fuck I set a buy order for $10
1616681569,It almost touched it
1616681572,Fil is 14%+
1616681628,ANT +44%
1616681808,Time to long?
1616681818,and make 150$ back?
1616681825,:virgin:
1616683097,are those shorts getting liquated?
1616683138,whats your entry
1616683266,52250
1616683293,had a bit of a buy up but its fallin a bit more now
1616683339,StorJ this is fun
1616684629,anyone applying in macdonals for job?
1616684670,nope. I avoided the food industry for my entry level positions. not worth tbh
1616684687,honestly grocery stores usually pay the same if not greater and they are a lot more relaxed
1616684737,ohh
1616684884,I wouldn’t mind serving tables
1616684890,Just not at mcdonald
1616685007,I worked at McDonald’s for 2 years and it was awful
1616685017,Take jeremys advice. It’s a shithole
1616685178,Serving tables can be profitable if you do a nicer establishment but its honestly not worth for some of the basic resteraunts
1616685191,I could maybe deal with being a server at a steak house of some sort
1616685211,I’d do that as a part time job tho
1616685220,If I’m studying
1616685230,No way i’d do that on the regular
1616685242,Being a valet is normally MORE profitable and you dont have to be around food
1616685246,They just gave me the bread at work
1616685250,especially at casinos
1616685262,And we aren’t doing shit
1616685263,valets at casinos and expensive hotels get a shit ton
1616685270,Due to coronavirus
1616685288,ya we aren't doing much at my job either. Im IT for a pizza joint so I just chill at the corp office most of the time
1616685317,perks of discounts on food in the food industry without having to actually work around food
1616685405,BTC is big chillin rn
1616685455,Can someone remind me which coins are gonna get listed on cb in 45?

1616690714,
1616690896,Seen that chart 100 times and still no idea how to read it lul
1616691037,I normally dont want to share this but if the price goes back to like 0.037-0.038 is good entry they will burn %50 of the tokens this week ( i hope ) my entry is 0.036
1616691043,And the name of the coin is $COS
1616691660,Quick question guys:
1616691674,"Is coinlist available to Europeans,"
1616691680,Or to Americans?
1616691695,Where do you have to live to make an account?
1616691740,"When it asks for your address for instance to verify,"
1616691756,Do you need to be in Europe? Or the US?
1616691782,Which ID will they accept?
1616691963,Does it not say on the website there’s normally some basic info on them ? I’m not sure myself
1616692060,"Also which crypto is best to deposit once account is set up, in order to buy Casper?"
1616692236,"Can someone please weigh in here,"
1616692252,Someone who has knowledge of Coinlist?
1616692267,Yes
1616692287,@TheOne  you said you bought Casper on Coinlist.  Are you in Europe? Or the US? Or where
1616692295,Yes
1616692301,Yes what?
1616692443,
1616692469,yes he is in europe
1616692589,For once I got my timing right. 😆 Too bad I didn't trust myself enough to put more than 6$
1616692764,wow
1616692764,nice
1616692797,"Always in cheap for the brag percentage, eh?"
1616692853,I'm still recovering from ENJ :(
1616692923,"@Alanox when I checked the fine print at the bottom of the Coinlist website, it says that their services are only available to US citizens"
1616692944,So how is that possible?
1616692949,hey 18$ is 18$
1616692976,It says coinlist services are not directed towards residents of any jurisdictions outside USA
1616692984,"ooooh, I'm VIP 1 now on Binance!"
1616693007,😬
1616693041,Also @Alanox  which crypto can I deposit in Coinlist?
1616693075,Btc usdt eth I think
1616693095,Ooo thats sexy af
1616693103,Unless they’ve  suspended everything except btc again
1616693108,gotta keep trading tho to keep that status
1616693117,ya
1616693139,its so hard to achieve honestly it should be like airlines
1616693154,one year + the remainder of the current year
1616693172,VIP 2 is just 2500 BTC volume on futures in 30d 😄
1616693228,I could just grind volume though with minimal loss or small gains. Like always open and close pos 😉
1616693307,only like 150000000$ USDT traded
1616693318,ndb
1616693449,I'm not quite sure about coinlist
1616693483,And what's the minimum and maximum buy in for Casper option 3 on Coinlist?
1616693511,100-5.000
1616693611,UK
1616693692,A GREEN
1616693817,Why this dip in the markets?
1616693821,Its because the ship?
1616693832,bear market bro
1616693865,Such a master the guy from the ship
1616693881,"Guys, what is the chance that Casper will go up more than 200%?"
1616693885,More like cuase or Whails cunts
1616693902,Is it worth investing 1k into?
1616693922,you want financial advice?
1616693934,here?
1616693946,I hope it’s  a good chance:) I’ll be 500 in. Option 1 for 200 and Option 3 if I’ll manage I plan another 300
1616693952,Don't invest if you can't affort to lose. Read #📈trading-101
1616693955,Casper will go higher
1616693965,Casper will go lower
1616694059,@Sultan  why do you say Casper will go lower?
1616694066,Below .03 cents?
1616694084,Cats shouldn’t even be able to have crypto accounts
1616694212,I expect casper to go several k% up in a year or two if the project isnt a scaem
1616694242,Not a scam
1616694253,Option 1 locked for 18 month so hopefully when box is opened it’s 0.30-0.50cent
1616694267,There are already coins that are launching on their blockchain
1616694277,Cats are crypto masters! Many whales are actually cats!
1616694371,Okay so I set up the Coinlist app and got my account verified and am sending BTC
1616694382,Can you buy Casper via the app?
1616694416,I dont think so
1616694426,You are so confident that you will get it :p
1616694632,website only.. make sure u join the Q an hour before. and Good luck getting in to first 20.000
1616694687,I lived through it.. stayed up tll 2am...  next day ahd 3 coffees.. I hope it was worht it  Mfucking casper:)
1616694729,When I duckduckgo Casper Coin I get a video on vimeo of a bird putting coins in a box!
1616694741,Are url links not allowed here?
1616694750,I put the link but my comment disappeared
1616694753,why would u duckduckgo lmao
1616694762,Instead of Google search
1616694765,Try it sometime
1616694774,"You need to be Sophomore or up to post links, see #🔼ranks"
1616694775,why not ask jeeves
1616694789,"@Alanox  ah okay, thanks!"
1616694803,I'm still trying to figure out how to increase rank here
1616694815,you just need to invite people.
1616694823,I would really like to see that podium group for instance
1616694845,"It's open for everyone for now #🎓post-grads-podium, but it will be closed soon and only be up for Sophomore & up."
1616695023,it wasnt too hard really thank to help from guys here . I've been there and done that  and now i can see podium :godsgardener:
1616695329,a
1616696253,"I made a BTC transfer from an exchange wallet to my new Coinlist account, and it went out of the first wallet but still isn't showing up in the Coinlist wallet!  It's been 30+ minutes"
1616696257,Is this normal?
1616696263,Should I be worried?
1616696276,"I triple checked the wallet address,"
1616696277,check the TXID
1616696282,And I used the correct address
1616696319,I have already waited 90+ minutes for a BTC transfer
1616696354,@Alanox  where do I check the TXID?  I found it in my exchange wallet but I don't know how to check it
1616696446,Coinlist is extremely busy atm. It takes longer than usual to transfer coins
1616696457,which exchange did u use
1616696457,Just be patient @felixthechat
1616696468,sup fellas
1616696575,🙋‍♂️
1616696716,waiting for the next dip
1616696727,just chilling before I go into panick mode again
1616696873,@Alanox  from Gemini account to Coinlist
1616696880,Gemini confirmed the withdrawal
1616696940,"But it's been almost an hour,"
1616696949,And it's not showing up in Coinlist
1616696982,try to find your transaction ID in your transactions history
1616697002,"Yes okay, I found the TXID"
1616697005,Now what?
1616697041,send it here.
1616697066,or go tohttps://www.blockchain.com/ and check how many confirmations it has
1616697084,Gemini says it has 4 confirmations
1616697120,Is it safe for me to post that here?
1616697154,"Or will it compromise my account or anything, or my privacy etc?"
1616697177,"We will just be able to see your address, the recipients address and the amount you sent"
1616697206,but 4 confirmations should be a complete transaction. Maybe Coinlist takes some time to update your balance
1616697260,d9f41a13fe6b4a5f8c1236d8ae63e3a74ae2ab96243060f2b7db42f5e9ede1b8
1616697275,Here @Alanox
1616697285,"yup, it's confirmed. Then the issue is with coinlist."
1616697365,Did Coinlist steal my bitcoin?
1616697372,I doubt it lol
1616697379,Are they a scam?
1616697390,"they did tell people to fill up their coinlist accounts weeks in advance, probably for a good reason."
1616697476,They have a warning on the app saying that ETH USDT and USDC deposits are offline or something
1616697483,But not BTC
1616697487,And I sent BTC
1616697537,It says Deposits: partial outage
1616697548,Where is my BTC then?
1616697555,Floating in the ether?
1616697583,@Pieter  you Dutch?
1616697601,Belgian
1616697622,Trying to load up BTC on Coinlist
1616697623,BTC deposits are temporarily closed and will reopen as soon as possible. Please try again shortly. Do not send funds to a previously saved address or to an address in your other CoinList wallets.
1616697660,Do you need to load up your wallet to be able to participate in the Casper sale or can you deposit once you get in (hopefully)?
1616697725,"In their e-mail they state:

After entering the site and completing the purchase flow, your purchase will be finalized when your deposit clears. If your deposit doesn't clear immediately, that's fine – we'll continue to wait until funds arrive."
1616697780,What does that mean do not send to an address in your other Coinlist wallets?
1616697844,I just setup my account on the app and they said to deposit crypto to get started and I went to the BTC section and clicked 'receive' which showed my BTC address on Coinlist and then I sent to that address from my other wallet
1616697877,"They generate deposit addresses for each deposit and they say not to use an already existing one, which seems quite normal to me"
1616697902,I don't understand
1616697904,"I never used coinlist before so there are no other addresses but they can't generate one for me now, it's down"
1616697908,What happened to my BTC?
1616697920,You'll need to wait till they get their shit sorted
1616697923,I sent it to the correct address for my btc wallet on Coinlist!
1616697943,"if it's confirmed on the chain you should be okay, they need to update their interface"
1616697982,It took like 3 hours before my btc showed up on their end
1616698066,yeah no need to panic I think @felixthechat unless you used a phising site but that doesn't seem very plausible since you used their app
1616698073,"you have to wait for it to be process through the blockchain, its not always instant"
1616698118,"like if youre transferring platform to platform, wallet to wallet"
1616698298,It already has 5 confirmations. Normally 2 is needed for coinlist. But their shitty backend is slow
1616698303,can btc just get to 54k and call it a day
1616698309,💀
1616698312,you hate to see it. rip
1616698322,And moving platform to platform or wallet to wallet all has the same slow btc speed
1616698328,yee
1616698341,$Nano is the future
1616698345,$NANO
1616698346,this is  why people  end up keeping their coins on the platforms
1616698355,because transferring is such a bitch and can be kinda sketch
1616698394,@That one belgian super cunt it now has 6 confirmations
1616698479,BTC deposit is up again
1616699447,"Okay so once my BTC goes into my wallet on Coinlist  (hopefully!), then how do I use it to buy Casper?  You mentioned special one time use addresses for deposits @Pieter"
1616699497,"I also think even if ur coin doest arive.. u still can ""buy"" coin and when money arrived and cleared ur purchase will be confinrmed"
1616699537,"my friend tried to buy, but then realise u cant buy with credit card lol so he left .. today got email reminding about  purchase.:)"
1616699582,"You'll see the purchase flow once you get in, I don't know either. Anyone got into option 1 or 2 ?"
1616699634,I got option 1.
1616699676,it says confirdmed/purchased.  document will be provided soon lol I suppose after 28th when sale ends. also option 1 will be locked for 18 month anyways.
1616699832,those who got XSL labs coins.. there is a vdeo on their youtube explaning whats next 🙂
1616699847,Yay!  BTC finally arrived in my Coinlist wallet
1616699863,I'm just not sure how to purchase Casper from the app
1616699911,Get in the queue at 00:00 tonight and wait patiently to get in
1616699946,sale starts at 1:00 Belgian time (00:00 UTC) Waiting queue opens at 23:00 UTC
1616699976,"Okay, can you get in the queue from the app?"
1616699999,only website
1616700001,you need to be preregistered though  so I hope you did that
1616700527,I just clicked on pre-register thing
1616700531,In some queue
1616700577,But okay so earlier I was asking people which country you need to use as residency to buy Casper on Coinlist
1616700605,Outside US
1616700610,exclusions are listed
1616700619,youll also have to have kyc done by now i would think
1616700623,No one really responded and so I checked coinlist and it said at the bottom that it was only for north America so I registered using my Canadian address and ID
1616700628,But I live in Europe
1616700636,i think canada is excluded too
1616700641,"So I just want to buy Casper,"
1616700655,And now I'm seeing that US and Canada are excluded
1616700665,U need to prove address.
1616700667,But I live in Europe and have a European ID
1616700671,"well, you live in eurpose"
1616700676,ur not excluded
1616700677,So it you Canadian living in Europe u good
1616700684,yea
1616700687,So do I need to set up a new Coinlist account?
1616700693,no
1616700694,No.
1616700698,Using my European ID and address?
1616700707,if they ask youll just need to provide a proof of residency
1616700708,bill
1616700709,bank statement
1616700711,Have you ever used the Internet before??????
1616700711,something
1616700726,U just need to fill up Eu address and send bill
1616700739,Just fuck around and it’ll work eventually no one is there to hold your hand lol
1616700809,🤠
1616701026,So okay I need to put proof of European residency in my account that I just opened which has North American residency?
1616701076,U can amend it u till KYS is done with prove of address submitted
1616702302,how can i report a dm advertiser
1616702363,Who?
1616702368,@justin B
1616702382,does he give advice that is scam?
1616702390,i’ll dm u the pic
1616702393,Bet
1616702532,how long until casper?
1616702700,Im sorry to have to be the one that tells you this but... you missed it
1616702703,it came out in 1995
1616702704,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112642/
1616702733,Im sorry mate. I know you were looking forward to it's release date
1616702803,I'll rent it for you and we can watch it together. I'll even bring popcorn so its like you didn't miss the release date and are watching it at the movies
1616702823,lmfaoo
1616702828,this dude
1616702833,also i love the casper movie hahah
1616702841,honestely it was pretty great tbh
1616702972,This is so annoying!  I have to now make a second Coinlist account with my European information
1616702991,Just don't be European
1616702997,https://tenor.com/view/feel-me-think-about-it-meme-gif-7715402
1616703059,being european is being top of the world class
1616703063,sorry to say
1616703080,unless you from new zealand
1616703083,thats a nice country
1616703139,New zealand is pretty lit tbh
1616703145,"That's so typical. Orange line: stop loss, blue line: take profit 💀"
1616703201,Played myself once more
1616703227,I started today off at -1200. I am now at -120
1616703252,Just gotta wait and BTC will fix everything 😍
1616703490,all my stuff has gone to shit
1616703510,got liquidated out of akro too overnight :(
1616703513,rember you only lose when you sell
1616703524,or get liquidated
1616703589,what does that mean
1616703602,forced position close
1616703629,happens when you lose to much on a margin play
1616703642,wait what
1616703647,sound stupid
1616703654,its so you dont go into debt
1616703689,i feel you man but dont do crypto with money you cant afford to lose ):
1616703709,"Just because you can ""afford"" to lose it, doesn't make the loss any better tbh"
1616703726,"you can lose a whole position and not have it be a big loss, like here, its just annoying is all"
1616703749,the position was less than 5% of my whole folio
1616703764,"Leverage is a tricky thing but if you use it right, its really helpful"
1616703782,My LUNA is carrying the fuck out of my whole portfolio
1616703823,TBH I was slightly worried about BTC hitting my SL
1616703829,luckily it didnt get close at all
1616703841,but those dips are pretty unpredictible on how low they will go
1616703882,"actually im getting annoyed at my bad luck 50/50 streak. its at about 6
im like, ok, i like x and i like y just as much. not sure which one to pick. every time, the one i pick goes down, and the one i dont pick goes up"
1616703908,Then split it up and go for both
1616703931,sounds like a good way to lose money on fees
1616703934,"I currently have 4 positions, 2 red, 2 green. They were all red this morning but now the green are carrying the red"
1616703965,The fees are the same regardless; 50$ at 0.01% + 50$ at 0.01% is the same as 100$ at 0.01%
1616703969,its not really worth splitting up an already small investment further imo
1616703992,Plus diversifying allows you to get a more balanced funding fee percentage
1616704012,Like my LUNA had a negative funding fee and the negative actually paid for the other position's fees
1616704019,which was really lit
1616704024,oh word
1616704026,that is nice
1616704070,and I got my friend into crypto last night and taught her futures. Gave her 50$ and she put in 50$ and she now has 4 positions that the 100$ is split into
1616704075,and all 4 of them are green
1616704098,Okay so now with my second Coinlist account they are saying they have trouble verifying my documents and information
1616704108,man if i had the run i had on my first week every week
1616704115,Could it be because I already have an account with my same name etc?
1616704127,I just want to buy Casper!
1616704148,"first week in trading, not just crypto but stocks to, i made close to 4x the amount i put in total"
1616704150,Why does this have to be so difficult?
1616704158,Thats probably a coinlist support question mate
1616704161,why do you need a second account?
1616704176,"Well I'm not sure if I do or not,"
1616704189,"My first week I lost 400$, my second-4th week I made 3000$."
1616704194,But I want to buy Casper which isn't available for residents in Canada
1616704201,do you live in canada
1616704201,"And I live in Europe,"
1616704205,then ur fine
1616704212,But I used my Canadian info when I made my account
1616704218,With Canadian address etc
1616704223,ah
1616704227,contact them
1616704235,So I'm trying to setup a new account with my European info
1616704243,making a second account could be seen as fradulent
1616704248,so i wouldnt advise that
1616704256,Oh damn
1616704258,just contact them
1616704264,I already started making a new one
1616704272,And I already went through all the stwps
1616704285,And they say they have trouble verifying my ID
1616704288,Steps
1616704298,
1616704298,ok so go contact them
1616704299,ban this guy
1616704327,I asked here earlier which national ID I should use and nobody answered
1616704339,you sure are spending alot of time not contacting them
1616704345,And on the Coinlist website it says only North Americans at the bottom
1616704355,Okay how do I contact them?
1616704364,itl be on the website somewherre
1616704364,lmao dude
1616704371,just like with every website ever
1616704410,probably shouldnt get in to crypto if you are having this big of an issue knowing what youre doing with general internet shit
1616704502,"What are you talking about? I got into crypto in 2010, I was an early adopter,"
1616704511,And I bought several bitcoins in 2011
1616704533,then youre competent enough to figure out how to sign up for a website
1616704616,"Damn,"
1616704632,Now coinlist has me waiting 54 minutes just to get to the website
1616704646,Just trying to find the contact info
1616704671,thats odd
1616704674,i only need to wait 3
1616704859,should tag @Kyle or @Chad  if you want so
1616704865,for bans
1616704892,did it
1616704908,and it's not chad. it's chupapi

1616705256,"I transferred some BTC 30 mins ago, wonder if it'll show in my Coinlist wallet in time"

1616706044,@felixthechat did u ever receive your BTC?

1616706270,brother google exists
1616706286,they dont have google in belgium
1616706298,https://tenor.com/view/google-gif-4825033
1616706311,im 99% any decent search can convert timezones
1616706314,"Belgium is +1 (pre-queue in 2 hours, sale in 3)"
1616706364,king shit
1616706383,U should walk around with a crown
1616706387,also UTC is +-00:00
1616706389,😘
1616706394,so whatever timezone urs in
1616706394,He does
1616706408,its just easy math
1616706420,"where i am, east cost of aus, we +11"
1616706428,so i take away 11 hrs to get the time for UTC
1616706436,fuck UTC
1616706446,@Alanox  yes!! I finally got my BTC.  Now I'm just trying to pre register for the Casper sale and having difficulties
1616706447,I only do english

1616706460,UTC = GMT
1616706469,fuck GMT
1616706473,I never went to school
1616706840,"I'm queuing on my phone for coinlist and every time, after a few minutes, if I had switched apps it will start me back over at the beginning of the queue"
1616706872,no point in queuing yet
1616706879,pre queue starts in 1 hr 45 mins
1616706907,"as long as you are in are that pre queue at the end of the hr, ull have a shot at getting it"
1616706926,"if its anything like option 1 (it will probably be worse), youll have about 20% chance"
1616707053,I'm trying to register
1616707059,You need to register first
1616707084,And I'm worried that it won't let me due to my account using my North American ID and address instead of my European
1616707100,I know the CEO let me ask him hold on
1616707125,Don't we need to register?
1616707128,yeah u wont be allowed too
1616707138,they will revieew ur prove of address.
1616707143,I can't even check the website for information without being put in a stupid queue
1616707155,They already verified my ID
1616707162,Not proof of address
1616707170,But I live in Europe
1616707171,residence is what importat not citizenship
1616707183,And they have my European phone number already
1616707201,did u upload bill/prove of address?
1616707227,it takes the 2 days to review ur address
1616707230,im sorry mate

1616707620,Or should I be queuing at 11?
1616707623,be in the queue when that hr ends
1616707639,you can get in at 11:58 and have the same chance as someone who got in at 11:00
1616707645,haha who asking for money
1616707655,I did. for 200. have 300 hanging on coinlist for more... i was 18k someting and got it afteer 2 hours of waiting. I should have gotten buy all during option 1. but  i didnt.. though better have some that I can use 40 days later not 18 month later.. saem time it was half price then. so should be good. hope tjose 200 will turn in looooads more after 18 moth plus they give 8% anyways on top if I m not mistaken.

1616709123,LUNA has been BAE
1616709266,so who is bearish or bullish on btc rn?
1616709316,gambling den is an apt name
1616709380,Is there a term for wanting to murder btc?
1616709408,hahha btc is what is carrrying the alts tho
1616709421,without btc we have no altcoins
1616709475,Usdt
1616709478,Busd
1616709479,Usdc
1616709500,There is no reason for good coins to die because btc decides to be shit
1616709576,yeah but at this point btc is like the dow jones for crypto
1616709891,Wasn't there a private ICO in Feb for Boson- min buy was like $50k. Whales bought lots at cheap price
1616709917,Yup I got a nice bag of SYL

1616710162,This coinlist is totally shite
1616710174,im tempted to move all my eth into BNB
1616710177,anyone have thoughts?
1616710188,"Yeah, my verification want some bank statement or recent utility bill before I can get it, but I think I might leave this one (Boson) out"
1616710193,"Every time I queue and then try to login to my account they ask me to do this email approval thing,"
1616710234,"I'm queuing on 3 different browsers plus the app,"
1616710240,Just trying to register
1616710260,I think it might be too late to register
1616710263,@That one belgian super cunt buy enjin 😄
1616710349,yeah fuck boson
1616710374,why not usdt?
1616710414,"Fuck this coinlist shite! I just got through an hour-long queue on the stupid app, and when it said that it was redirecting me to the site once the time was up, it then put me back in the queue again"
1616710458,but its a shorter queue no?
1616710464,are u trying to enter the site?
1616710467,"binance is killing it with the regulatory aspect rn, they just hired another 2 ex FATF regulators as their advisor"
1616710489,i think binance has the potential to be the global bloomberg of crypto
1616710494,they had a burn too I think recently
1616710503,wouldve been a good oppertunity to buy in then
1616710726,When you thought all enjin shillers left😪
1616710810,Ban him
1616710961,"Okay so I finally got through the queue in one of my browsers, and for the registration for the Casper option 3 buy in, I uploaded a recent insurance bill with my address and name on it (they asked for utility bills but my landlord pays those), so I hope this will work!"
1616710976,"It says identity and photos are verified,"
1616710988,And Residence is pending
1616711005,I really hope they verify it in the next hour 🙏
1616711018,i took screen shpt of online banking statment and it was enough

1616711128,"!warn @dr.enjin no shilling, check #📜rules"
1616711128,
1616711378,Trying to buy Casper
1616711390,A new token being launched
1616711394,Presale
1616711412,It's where they list coins
1616711457,I hope you'll all get that email soon ;)
1616711464,

1616711562,okay
1616711564,Yes
1616711590,we should have USDT in coinlist pro ?
1616711605,But don't bother if you haven't registered yet. Can take some days
1616711620,"In your normal coinlist wallet, not pro"
1616711631,Or usdc
1616711637,okay thank you
1616711656,i registered already..but ihave usd in pro
1616711669,congrats brother
1616711688,Thx Prince :D
1616711695,What's the thing about Casper?
1616711704,Will be trying tonight for my friend
1616711716,save some for us too 🤣
1616711767,"It's a new promising token that launched this week. You're probably a bit too late to get it now, but there will be more interesting projects launching on CoinList as well soon"
1616711819,What was the price?
1616711833,0.03 usd i think
1616711841,for option 3 sale
1616711850,"$0.015 for option 1, $0.03 for option 3"
1616711918,Is it going to binance?
1616711964,"Maybe yes, maybe no. They didn't announce that yet."
1616712127,"Statistically, based on other coinlist releases, the chance is 11/15. So almost 75%. Ofc this doesn’t say much:kekw:"
1616712189,"But the coins that are going so far to launch on coinlist, are probably willing to go far to list on binance"
1616712311,fucking coinlist
1616712314,let me in to login you assholes
1616713317,in casper
1616713323,waiting

1616713424,"But hey, they shuffle so shouldn't matter"
1616713486,"Thanks to the guys vouching for ANKR here a while back, had a great return on that so far"
1616714052,evryone glued to screens of casper  lol cheel guys.
1616714056,Does anyone know what the contact email is for coinlist?

1616714065,anther 45 min till u get ur number
1616714099,yep
1616714128,Bro this is like hour 4 of this 😂😂😂😂
1616714164,I finally was able to register and upload my proof of residence
1616714179,But Coinlist says my residence is pending still
1616714191,"I'm in the waiting room now for Casper,"
1616714211,You're probably too late. For some people it took days to get their KYC confirmed
1616714213,But I'm not sure how it works and when they will verify my residence document
1616714227,I had my ID verified in an hour or less
1616714286,residency usually takes a couple of days
1616714311,At least you'll be settled for the next Coinlist ICO 🙂
1616714458,ANKR going crazy
1616714479,I wrote to coinlist and have a ticket in asking them to please verify my residence so I can participate in the sale
1616714486,"So,"
1616714499,🤞
1616714509,"like i and multiple others have said, usually takes a couple of days"
1616714518,"u might get lucky, who knows"
1616714524,2 days Id say
1616714620,36 mins guys!
1616714632,:kucoin:
1616714654,it better be worth it lol
1616714667,Thanks good. Something green for me
1616714687,Not sure when to take proft
1616714690,Though
1616714705,uh ankr?
1616714715,probably take some now
1616714731,depending on where i got in i would dump it all now
1616714731,"I took some, got x6 and got back in with half of it"
1616714763,"like, looks close between the bulls and the bears"
1616714792,"3m says its basically even, but on the overbought side"
1616714822,"so if it were me personally, and i was looking at like anything less than double, it dump it now. if its more than double, id take out some"
1616714831,depends on where you got in really
1616714875,I got it 0.10000
1616714919,thats 20% right now
1616714924,not too bad
1616714936,"Got in at 0,02 USDT"
1616714940,sold at the top
1616714956,looks very unlikely to break that very recent high
1616714962,sold just now i started to drop
1616714966,at least anytime in the next few minutes
1616714996,good for u. next time shout if u find any Gem for 0.02 tht go 0.12 then lol

1616715409,what

1616715461,not me
1616715468,someone sold one nft for 46eth
1616715472,on the platform
1616715485,oh
1616715495,i was wondering of selling some things i have
1616715499,but cant pay the gas
1616715510,maybe if we get a huge bull or sum
1616715520,or eth fees drop to the fucking ground like they should
1616715641,but the price
1616715644,can make me fear
1616715661,30$ for one coin is too much
1616715749,30$ what
1616715843,$mega
1616715872,can someone help me setup my first short on binanace?>
1616715893,"i dont know a lot, i just buy and sell :/"
1616715917,i want to short ankr to .08
1616715933,open futures account on binance
1616715943,transfer USDT to coin M futures wallet
1616715956,go to ANKRusdt on the futures page
1616715965,set amount of ankr you want to short. click short
1616716024,what a nice guy
1616716042,just a qyestion.  say i would do that with 50 usd. and set it .08.. what would be the gain?
1616716060,you dont set the price
1616716063,you just set the short
1616716066,and you exit whenever
1616716074,i mean you could set a take profit at that value
1616716077,Depends on the leverage you use
1616716086,"i need to learn about it, as seems like I am missing profits lol"
1616716136,i need one day someone walk me though same step by step 🙂
1616716182,"From 0.11 to 0.08 = (0.08 - 0.11) / (0.11) = -27%, if you short that's 27% profit with 1x leverage"
1616716278,"If you use e.g. 10x leverage that'd be 270% profit. Though the higher leverage you use, the more risk you'll have of losing your money. 5x is more than enough to start with"
1616716298,id start with x5 i think
1616716309,need to try it day time fresh head 🙂
1616716323,Though ANKR is quite volatile right now so even lower leverage could also be safer
1616716469,got my 0.10 sold it .0.12 🙂
1616716771,30 seconds
1616716775,hype time
1616716779,im in the quueue

1616718825,are you serious
1616718843,then refreshed and said my position had been used and i had to rejoin - 350K in the queue
1616718875,ive screen recorded it and contacted coinlist and caspar but they are gonna be able to do fuck all

1616719671,for ages
1616719684,hell they even still said that when coinlist announced the lottery
1616719710,Was it literally random where you got put in the queue?
1616719724,apparently
1616719728,but people like
1616719738,You don’t stand a chance then
1616719739,rejoined with different browsers....and somehow got ahead of their original spot
1616719755,was scuffed
1616719755,Especially with so few coins and such a relatively high max buy
1616719991,lol you could apparently queue without being logged in which is how you could open a billion tabs
1616720002,mina looks interesting
1616720066,Yeah that did seem weird. It should have been a specific link to pre approved option 3 users
1616720084,Eqch logged in user has a specific URL
1616720132,i think the email link was personalised but there was a generic link

1616720584,And invest in $CHAD.
1616720602,lol Casper and coinlist are getting destroyed on socials
1616720604,$CHAD in my ❤️
1616720636,Well lots of unhappy ppl because they missed out. What they could do
1616720645,Limit the buy to 50$?
1616720680,Yes
1616720686,not do a option that had 50K buy options after the destruction of option 1. make option 3 also limited to 1K or even 500
1616720693,And get better web servers
1616720714,Web servers were OK
1616720721,Yeah I asked to join the Dev team for this

1616721235,they know how shit everything was after option 1. people were furious but they just doubled down. all is good. naaah. kept their super whale option 2 instead of trying to give normal people more chances. and then kept option 3 to 5K dollars max buys. the coinlist lottery was exploitable. whales just kept on buying 5000 dollars worth of coins

1616731338,"as someone who has worked at a grocery store, in a fast food joint, and doing manual labor at a timber yard, i can absolutely say that the timber yard was the easiest shit and paid the most"
1616731338,Its good money though
1616731358,The movie theater was my easiest job
1616731363,my current job is second easiest
1616731393,Movie theater you only really worked about 30% of the time as most of the time you were just chilling with your friends waiting for the movies to get out
1616731421,"my current job, I rarely have things I need to deal with so I only really work about 20-30% of my day and trade crypto the other 70-80%"
1616731450,only experience with movie theatre work is with an ex who worked at one
1616731456,that was chill
1616731473,the local ones are so much better than the franchise ones
1616731489,we only have franchise ones tbh
1616731492,there is a local movie
1616731496,but it never shows anything ever
1616731506,"we could get as much free popcorn, candy, and soda as we wanted both on and off the clock and we could watch movies for free whenever we wanted"
1616731512,we even prewatched movies before they came out
1616731515,yea
1616731518,that was nice
1616731529,we hung out a bunch in theatres when she was on the clock
1616731536,the movie keys were locked until the release day but we could stay up till midnight and watch right when the day changed
1616731537,but it wasnt a very long relationship
1616731553,Movies are cool but they usually pay poorly
1616731570,mine paid minimum wage + 0.25(7.50$ USD an hour)
1616731585,"once I left, it dropped to straight minimum wage(7.25 USD an hour)"
1616731601,"they paid min over here too, at the time i think it was 16ish per hr for my ex"
1616731605,aud
1616731632,still better than what ours paid
1616731644,16 AUD = 12.18 USD
1616731654,US minimum wage is a joke

1616754362,It’s still 200$.. don’t pretend like you can buy a house with that

1616754381,Cuz im a retard

1616754426,You have to keep it
1616754441,If they are that important
1616754445,Not fuckin invest it
1616754475,I also made a similar mistake when I started out. It sucks but it's a learning experience so it won't happen to me again. The Postgrads here have good calls so you'll make that money back soon 🙂

1616757435,@kittiewitty  can you explain how you rebounded from 5k to 11k?
1616757461,Per your comment earlier
1616757465,Is theta suffering from the postponed 3.0 mainnet?
1616757478,Balls deep in leverage @felixthechat
1616757489,"nftdeals.io  Cool new NFT project from Switzerland. They do athlete experience, sell real collectables connected to token not only digital, also have governance token. Company is called blocsport.one."
1616757558,how can i block those scam dms?
1616757608,Just have to block them each time they message
1616757624,Yeah it’s all bots @GuiMaXGbG
1616757669,if those messages were true at the moment i should have around 20 btc
1616757681,from giveaways i have never entered
1616757696,How much do you have rn
1616757700,"@kittiewitty  oh I thought it was just from spot.  I need a similar recovery, and we kitty's need to look out for each other  ;)"
1616757726,"My portfolio is at 7k, down from 12k"
1616757771,"I was almost liquidated from 13,5k to 4K on Monday"
1616757777,Wouldn’t recommend leverage :p
1616757830,"$AUDIO is exploding, damn"
1616758127,I don’t know what happened with ada
1616758133,But it’s not stopping
1616758142,thanks god for ADA
1616758152,soon liberate :kekw:
1616758158,What's the occasion and how long would you expect it to last this time? 😃
1616758181,They had a podcast yday it might be a weird delayed reaction
1616758233,😩  no please
1616758234,I’m gonna assume pre-pricing before updates
1616758236,Ada wait
1616758247,tf
1616758260,im missing my pre-futures pf
1616758264,28th is the update day right?
1616758269,"i had 170 ada, like 50-60% of whole"
1616758348,You just know it’s going to fall 😔
1616758375,https://tenor.com/view/fail-bird-cat-no-flying-gif-9884254
1616758397,Ada last bull run^^
1616758426,
1616758436,Vroooooooom
1616758439,Not so sure about it
1616758441,Go go ada
1616758445,ATH
1616758471,This looks different to last movements. It’s way too sharp
1616758489,do you think it's about news?
1616758510,But we never know 😆 😆
1616758520,Most likely they set out some road map
1616758531,I’ve got this feeling it’s gonna finally stick
1616758538,No no o ada wait for me
1616758553,Wait till i get hone from work and long you
1616758564,And ofc that it will crash
1616758566,You’ve had nearly a month lol to long this
1616758568,Like always
1616758603,Well there was this crash last week ...that got plenty of people liquidated
1616758628,There are news circulating that it will be the next top crypto
1616758662,That’s because well
1616758669,Every shiller says that about the thing they're holding most of
1616758670,Was around 1.05-1.10 for ages
1616758671,ADA is a great project with a roadmap
1616758694,"It’s like Theta, part of the innovation cycle"
1616758707,"I'm not shilling I'm just stating facts, I do a lot of research before invest"
1616758718,Would be pretty happy if it replicates price lol
1616758732,Ada needs about bitcoin market cap
1616758738,to get to theta price
1616758750,"I got friends that don't know nothing about crypto, but they know about bitcoin, ethereum and cardano somehow"
1616758774,Well full decentralization is happening in a couple of dag so its probably that
1616758776,"And ripple too, but that mighty be due the court case"
1616758785,"What are some solid long term holds? Looking to getting some at the end of the month, what are everyone’s favourites?"
1616758797,ALGO
1616758819,Struggling to go to .26
1616758827,Oh
1616758833,It just has
1616758843,Jesus
1616758862,The last moves of Ada antecipa Ted the moves of btc
1616758887,If might mean that btc will go up
1616758941,I think it will go to the ATH during the weekend
1616758958,Which one?
1616758965,ADA
1616758976,Ath is like .48 or something
1616758976,but everything is possible
1616758988,^
1616759005,What are you talking about?
1616759012,You bugged?
1616759016,Ada?
1616759034,ADA-usdt ath is ~1.48
1616759047,Sorry
1616759049,yes
1616759050,Yeah thought so
1616759058,She didn't put the 1
1616759062,and more on Coinbase :kekw:
1616759068,And like I do in euros is different
1616759075,"1.80 on Coinbase, right?"
1616759093,Yeah it almost was at 2.00 everyone was pissed at Binance
1616759113,Everyone dumped ada to shit then
1616759117,Like holy fuck
1616759133,I’m probably too late to future it 😦
1616759140,"But that's no problem, just transfer Ada to coinbase"
1616759190,I had one yesterday at 1.08. but my SL got triggered
1616759219,Yikes 😦
1616759233,You sound just like me
1616759244,18% x75😪
1616759254,That's why I stopped using sl
1616759259,And got liquidated 😹 😹
1616759288,Can’t check rn.. how are the selling orders looking on ada?
1616759366,Two barriers left to ath
1616759395,Where?
1616759414,Cause this 4hr candle is insane
1616759422,And it came out of nowhere
1616759440,"Still a lot to go through, just smaller walls though"
1616759470,Bouncing around a lot though
1616759514,Not really
1616759525,Breakout was quite predictable
1616759525,I asked what happened
1616759539,Yeah
1616759557,Might be able to short it soon
1616759580,God damn it im missing all the fun
1616759587,I don’t know how you guys short it
1616759590,All the money I lost on futures was shorting 😩
1616759591,I’d never
1616759612,I’d be too scared to short ADA this close to decentralisation
1616759630,You’d have to have big balls
1616759639,There is announcment coming on sunday or?
1616759766,They already confirmed the decentralization update
1616759769,The situation is similar to the ada ath moment
1616759774,Market dropped
1616759776,Look on IOHKs twitter
1616759785,Ada dropped at first but then it took off
1616759794,ADA is one of the most solid investments so far
1616759820,I’m not longing now but I know i’ll regret it
1616759829,Long long term investment
1616759889,"Got my Ada stacked, my son can thank me later"
1616760107,12x 15min green candles in a row lol
1616760119,That was pretty insane increase
1616760137,Not really
1616760148,Stmx 6x his value in a day
1616760167,I’m talking for a coin at this price
1616760177,And recent history
1616760189,It was like last week
1616760196,Or 2 weeks ago
1616760201,Don't remember 😹
1616760236,I assume he is talking about the money inflow :p
1616760245,compared to e.g. stmx
1616760265,Just hope there isn’t an equal decrease lol
1616760277,It might have
1616760344,Hopefully the ADA bullish Saturday  trend returns tomorrow
1616760363,Was fun those couple weeks in a row where it just went up for fun
1616760430,And sugar we're going down swingin
1616760574,There’s an article someone wrote panning cardano. I can’t post link unfortunately. Called ‘Backlash Following Later Than Expected Rollout For Cardano Smart Contracts’
1616760758,ive now set Ada as my long term and just going to leave for the year - will see what happens 🙂
1616760809,God doesn't please everyone
1616760848,"If they manage to roll it out in the time Charles says, price will be insane come end of year"
1616760876,I’m hoping for Babel
1616760895,Because that is what can really put ADA top of the market
1616760905,EOY ETA
1616761073,What part is babel again
1616761392,Replacement for ETC-20 basically
1616761397,Coinminting with automatic security
1616761413,"Which makes the process a lot easier, unified and better"
1616761431,Also includes protocols etc.
1616762094,Cake brrrr
1616763612,You guys should take a look into $TEL. It will soon be listed on Binance. Big potential here
1616763974,Seen a lot of talk about TEL recently
1616763987,Anyone in one Harmony ONE?
1616763997,Where can we buy it from bossman?
1616764000,25 hours ago would have been a good buy point for $TEL by the looks of it
1616764024,They’re doing a AMA on reddit later. Looking for it to shoot after maybe?
1616764024,KuCoin
1616764070,any TA to know whether its just at its high cycle or its on a bit of a bull run? hard to tell
1616764106,"It's gonna go parabolic, so no good entry point lol"
1616764108,Source? In their Telegram they say that they have no plans to add TEL on other exchanges
1616764159,Plans change
1616764200,guys you cant make this shit up
1616764205,everything is going down
1616764210,(red)
1616764215,except the position I shorted
1616764216,lmfao
1616764225,🤣
1616764228,axs is mooning
1616764230,"Nah, all you see is red"
1616764234,and right after I shorted
1616764276,You should wait until you take a position again. Don't let red and green candles fool you.
1616764304,fuck me 😤
1616764308,I hate crypto
1616764319,everything wants to do the opposite that I want
1616764326,Exactly lol
1616764359,That's the point. Shakeout
1616764362,"watch me sell and long this instant, and watch it drop"
1616764423,"If you get liquidated, it better be worth it because you don't want to see that due to a position at an all time high lmao"
1616764441,😭
1616764444,if it did
1616764445,Id quit
1616764447,lmfao
1616764452,id actually quit

1616764574,yeah

1616764727,"Once you get that patience up, your mindset will attract money more than lose. It's about trades with more gain than lose. Losses are inevitable anyway"
1616765037,are things going down?

1616765137,"Options expiring in 2.5 hours, probably gonna go red a bit more"
1616765171,what is red now ?
1616765174,*confused*
1616765181,or are you talking about a week timespan?
1616765209,BTC might go down some more in the next 2.5 hours
1616765220,"I'll sleep until then and wake up to a moonshot, hopefully lol"
1616765238,Atm im all cashout waiting for a dip 🙂
1616765250,a dip even bigger then yesterday?
1616765257,fml :p
1616765261,Idk I took 30% profit today
1616765265,"Uh, maybe not, sir"
1616765276,But after the expiration the price could go up again in the coming days
1616765291,we're just coming out of a dip
1616765291,not sure that BTC will hit 50k again
1616765312,Hallelujah
1616765316,I kinda assume that the 50k DIP was caused by the option thing
1616765336,Ik i just took my profit out of it ^^
1616765366,we are now at the level that we were the first dip earlier this week :p
1616765388,What color lambo y'all getting
1616765389,so I hope the bulls take over again after the options uncertainty is gone
1616765393,I'm just waiting for a decent entry point for $TEL. Throwing $100 in there
1616765402,Tesla colored
1616765402,a lambo doesnt fit my kids man
1616765403,All colors
1616765409,Mercedes GLE is good enough
1616765418,Chad :goldchadcoin:
1616765421,waiting for $TEL entry
1616765441,Love red
1616765478,Careful with that assumption. 2 days may change this
1616765486,you always gotta have a family car + weekend toy/car
1616765537,lessons learned from the previous dip
1616765546,put stop losses
1616765551,dont assume it will bounce back :p
1616765579,"Yes, but even more so, what i do is, put an alert right under my stop loss. Turn up the volume so i can take advantage of the dip."
1616765606,yea but when the dip is in stages
1616765610,when do you resume
1616765616,when it goes back up right?
1616765621,I m very doubtful the dip is over
1616765629,"Ohh, if it falls now, will be to the 47k or below area. It will bounce the fuck back like a fucking horse on steroids getting laid on chrismas."
1616765653,ENJ to 1.7 ish then?
1616765655,"It will bounce! One down, one up"
1616765697,"We're looking at $3 possibly before the dip. Then the dip will send it back to 2.1-2.2, and teh final bounce might projectile it to 3.425"
1616765738,"Personally, im thinking that my $10 sell target is still possibly by 6th april"
1616765744,yea but if BTC would fall this weekend
1616765755,it will drag ENJ below 2 :p
1616765769,See historical data. Never stays down. Specially not now with the BTC panic buying after all the crazy btc news
1616765770,altho it did quite well the last dip
1616765791,"Not a chance. If it does, i will be super super happy."
1616765803,I leveraged 50k dollar in ENJ monday evening
1616765807,I misclicked 😂
1616765817,got me liquidated almost lol
1616765818,Haha. Good man.
1616765842,Timing is important. Learn from the belgium cunt. I learnt a LOT from him
1616765848,"lowering your leverage just adds more cash to it, lessons learned"
1616765867,Currently i have 4k in spot and 8k in 5x isolated
1616765875,:kekw: oh you enji shills. 10 dollars by 6th of april. You lot are insane
1616765877,Still 100% enj
1616765887,YOU PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO THIS
1616765894,I am trying to protect you
1616765901,if it hits 3 dollar I would be so happy tbh :p
1616765917,It doesnt matter
1616765926,Im still in :kekw:
1616765946,"One thing iv learnt with ENJ, be ok with losing out on profit. Set a sell target. I've lost money because i wanted to sell at the absolute peak"
1616765971,I reduced my leverage the last days with a lot :p
1616766052,"Honestly, i think you're fine. My advice, when it hits a high enough number you are happy with, ~~you could put a stop loss (in case im right)~~ (nevermind, better to sell and buy lower instead). I know its a far off stretch, but my recent problems with transfers shows me the importance of jumpnet. Fuck! Wanted to transfer some USDT to someone - 40$ and it charged me $28 as fees. FUcking retarded."
1616766092,ENJUSDT Perpetual 13201.89756 USDT    2.15506    2.27083    709.20702 (40.79%)
1616766103,Imagine it would go to 3 dollar :p
1616766109,WTF? How?
1616766119,It wont let me put in more than 5K
1616766128,on what leverage?
1616766135,50x
1616766139,ohhh
1616766144,Fuck binance
1616766157,"the lower the leverage, the more you can add"
1616766158,Yknow you can change the network
1616766160,To bep20
1616766169,Thats binance to binance right?
1616766171,For usdt
1616766175,No I did binance to kucoin
1616766179,With 0.8 dollar fee
1616766193,Ahh. Same as BCH that i used finally.
1616766199,Still tho.
1616766207,Shows that we need more options
1616766211,Erc-20 is the reason ADA needs to hurry up babel
1616766228,Not sure if that will hit us this year tho
1616766249,"But yea, ada is my next buy in after ENj"
1616766290,I will get into some ADA eventually. It's just not exciting enough atm. I'm not a hodling boi
1616766355,I was just being polite
1616766359,I bought the dip at 1.02 or something
1616766364,but I sold again at 1.13
1616766371,not the best move in retrospective :p
1616766383,You can put another buy order at 0.84 (i think). No one listens to me
1616766413,no it was 1.04500
1616766423,but I had to sell to keep my other leverages alive lol
1616766424,"When the big dipper comes, if it does, we'll see some fireworks"
1616766436,Oh god. The leverages! So much fucking work. Lol
1616766445,I do cross
1616766446,its ok
1616766447,😂
1616766450,
1616766454,ENJ
1616766558,what was your entry for your *50?
1616767207,My 50?
1616767218,What are people's thoughts on AGI?
1616767243,Called SingularityNET
1616767304,Woah! Thats volatile as fuck! Thanks! On it!
1616767332,Dammit! No futures
1616768335,Chr brrr
1616768377,6B $ BTC options expiration in 2 hours. Will BTC go up or go down?
1616768428,No fucking clue
1616768440,
1616768474,Large amount is on the better end of the spectrum
1616768520,SAFEMOON
1616768568,What does dat mean? Most likely go up then?
1616768614,Not really
1616768620,Most likely nothing’ll happen
1616768638,As some plonkers bet for bitcoin to go down to 4k
1616768641,:kekw:
1616768854,And on the other hand we have these complete chads believing bitcoin would reach 120k
1616768892,120k is much better prediction than 4k
1616768902,Not really
1616768920,You think we’ll see btc to 4k?
1616768933,Just as unlikely as 120k in that timeframe
1616768936,elrond staking phase 3 incoming
1616768944,"If the global economy crashes, 4k could be possible tbh"
1616768951,Oh you are talking in a specific timeframe
1616768965,We’ll never see 4k again
1616768969,As long as bitcoin remains something with a speculative value as backing
1616768976,It can go anywhere
1616769016,I only think we would see 4k if crypto is done existing
1616769033,I think its possible
1616769036,Unlikely but possible
1616769043,Either due to a global market crash
1616769069,Or due to bitcoin becoming irrelevant in the grand scheme of crypto
1616769071,then we are all done for lol
1616769090,That could liquidate 80-90% of the market value
1616769090,ok yea if other coins overtake it
1616769101,Which means 1T+ value just goes *poof*
1616769113,If btc goes poof
1616769120,All the rest goes poof
1616769126,No that means
1616769130,🥁
1616769135,The market can rebuild on another crypto
1616769139,Anyway
1616769147,Btc will always stay number 1
1616769152,On that chart
1616769169,And also highest market cap asset
1616769181,@kittiewitty CHR
1616769184,📝  NotMatt doesn’t understand how this market works
1616769211,I hope it doesn’t go back to .38-40 again
1616769223,Cause I’ve been waiting for a while now
1616769226,somebody is pumping :p
1616769240,"Not true. You have to remember that even bitcoin started out small. If bitcoin died, others would take it's place. It affects the market very strongly in our current conditions but we can't assume that if BTC died, everything else would die with it"
1616769249,It would 100% tank the market
1616769282,But bitcoin's power isn't something that HAS to be exclusive to it
1616769284,Yeah same LMAO
1616769311,Ok but what happens if everything goes down? Btc goes down less than all the other cryptos
1616769333,Unless something specific happens to btc
1616769351,Not entirely true either. Some coins resist bitcoin's dip harder than bitcoin resist dipping
1616769360,Nothing gonna overtake it
1616769397,"I agree with you on that because I don't see it dipping to a 4k valuation like what you guys were talking about BUT in the hypothetical world where it did go that low, something COULD overtake it"
1616769423,I mean if we talk
1616769435,Where is it going to be in 50 years
1616769438,Then maybe
1616769440,Yes
1616769450,Something will overtake it
1616769459,10 years
1616769462,IMO
1616769475,When investors start realizing that bitcoin is the ultimate shitcoin
1616769490,Respectable
1616769511,I don’t think the same but none of us know what will happen
1616769513,I refuse to back something that has no intrinsic value
1616769529,Ethereum and ada have done much more tbh
1616769564,Xmr is the future
1616769572,Im just hoping ETH's phase 1.5 comes during the summer
1616769584,Get it out if the rut its in now
1616769598,Ethereum is in deep shit thanks to well
1616769600,Miners
1616769604,Gas fees
1616769612,Liqx eth
1616769627,Gas fees aren't really effected by miners. Its affected by the bidding process
1616769627,Guess that doesn’t work here lol
1616769643,I listed them separately because of that
1616769643,I jumped out @hollowviper
1616769644,the reason why its so quick is because transactions bid on who gets in first
1616769649,feel like it hit a wall :p
1616769657,Oh gotcha
1616769661,Heyyalldontsaythat
1616769665,I thought you were attributing the gas fees to the miners
1616769677,I have to much leverage not to take 100% lol
1616769679,$50 gas fees
1616769689,While others do it for ~$1
1616769692,Fuck off
1616769694,:kekw:
1616769700,But ya we don't need ETH 2.0 full release. We just need phase 1.5
1616769708,thats what gets rid of the current gas system
1616769734,Same hahaha
1616769759,There are a lot of things on the bucket list for 2.0 which is great but people see the long bucket list and get worried because they don't read how the phases work
1616769779,Thats where a LOT of misinformation of 2.0 comes from
1616769802,People can’t even read ADA’s roadmap
1616769808,Sounds like y’all are deep in ETH
1616769811,Most of the things in 2.0 are just quality of life things but the one part ETH NEEDS is that gas fee change
1616769843,Im not super deep but I like the project. I primarily am deep in BTC and LUNA because of this dip
1616769853,Luna is good bet
1616769862,Research pays off
1616769876,"Got me into ANKR, MBL and Theta before they went up high"
1616769890,Oh and ADA a year ago at $0.05
1616769925,kuddos to you for being active in the bearmarket
1616769945,im not a huge fan of ada in the short term but long term I think it will be a good coin
1616769952,Why Luna I haven’t found much about it
1616770001,"Yeah got into THETA at $8, ETH before 1k and XMR at $30"
1616770047,I Road ETH from 1400->1800 the last big climb. 12x. It paid WELL!
1616770058,1000$ turned into 4000ish$
1616770087,Imagine roading theta from $2
1616770116,Tryna ride from 8 lol
1616770167,
1616770185,I predict that bitcoin will be mooning real soon my friends
1616770187,@Jeremyfto what was your entry into ETH
1616770192,Like this time round
1616770198,1400ish
1616770205,No not back then
1616770210,1400ish
1616770212,I thought you had a long on now
1616770212,back then
1616770226,now I have a long at 1666
1616770243,I didnt expect it to drop so hard and bought in too early
1616770246,now im playing catch up
1616770254,but its my smallest bag so its nbd
1616770325,Ya that is kind of the general consensus of what April is suppose to bring in general
1616770332,80000$ price contracts expiring
1616770354,April is looking very bullish
1616770404,What’s your ETH liq
1616770410,Oh wait you’re cross
1616770424,770 is my liq but my SL is 1400
1616770439,I don't want ETH emptying me out 😂
1616770449,Will the little Enjin that could do extraordinary things ?
1616770473,At this point I have no clue. Its a weird ass coin in a weird ass market
1616770487,yeah man glad to see people agreeing with me ahah. im still kinda new to crypto

1616770496,NFT market is sooooo weird bro @Jeremyfto
1616770554,ya im staying away from ENJ predictions
1616770578,I didnt believe in it from the start and it just skyrocketed and then crashed and now its just chilling. I made some good money off it tho
1616770629,why do I feel like every coin already mooned
1616770633,before the btc moon
1616770636,💀
1616770657,Yea I hate Enj tbh
1616770664,I got my big bag directly IN BTC
1616770673,Btc always a great bet
1616770675,15xing that bitch all the way to 78k
1616770683,looooool
1616770686,🤣
1616770693,I hope we get there
1616770709,"If the bulls are aiming for 80k in April, Im gonna aim under that"
1616770731,yeah thats smart
1616770733,thats smart
1616770743,smart contracts already expired right?
1616770775,"I think there were some contracts expiring in 30 minutes according to someone else's research(I didn't fact check it) but for the most part, yep"
1616770787,time to buy I guess
1616770794,seems better than TRX though?
1616770797,havent traded the whole day
1616770802,unfortunate we didnt get that dip I was aiming for
1616770802,for the fear of smart contracts
1616770808,yeah
1616770810,exactly
1616770811,my 16$ LUNA buy will never hit now 😭
1616770817,so I missed every dip
1616770824,I should of pre bought existing dips
1616770832,PAINN
1616770833,@Trinity I hate Trx it’s pumped by celebs
1616770953,Justin to the moon!
1616770990,where are we rebuying CHR @hollowviper ?
1616771183,Under 0.4
1616771400,And if it doesn’t drop that far then we wish it luck and watch painfully as it soars to 0.7
1616771631,Yeah wth is good with it? The moves been trash. I liked the hype around it but it’s looking like a dud
1616771648,Their biz plan looks good tho
1616771697,I got into when the real estate press released dropped but it hasn’t done shit since
1616771729,6/04 the release their jumpnet tho
1616771740,perhaps there is a hype leading up
1616771741,ENj?
1616771793,yes
1616771818,We’ll see what happens like I said much didn’t happen with the real estate collab with LABS
1616771836,but it was already so pumped then
1616771844,I don’t get how tho when it’s barely pumped
1616771875,"True, I’m holding out on it cause I honestly just think people will be late to the party"
1616771889,2 me it looks like a party tho
1616772157,Aave anyone? Predictions?
1616772488,"I personally stay away @wealthington I’ve seen a lot of people make bags, just don’t like that marketing tactic"
1616772499,Elongate 1X already... Expecting 2 or 3X by tomorrow
1616772506,32 minutes till nothing will happen
1616772635,What’s meant to happen
1616772641,who's in on Elongate?
1616772660,the options expire
1616772673,not sure if there is a direct impact tho :p
1616772730,whats elongate
1616772785,i say it should be between 2-2.20
1616772790,but nvm
1616772815,I agree
1616772821,Its current price is acceptable
1616772874,No it needs to be 2.59
1616772885,Minimum
1616772963,^ (Belgians entry price)
1616772971,:kekw:
1616772989,the highest I bought ENJ was 2.8 lol
1616773011,I bought and sold ENJ at various prices and times but I sold on profit every time
1616773024,before the big ENJ crash
1616773174,I remember buying ENJ on spot at 0.65 and selling at 0.89 because I thought this shit ain’t getting to a dollar
1616773176,NFT market outlook really uncertain rn
1616773186,"search for Elongate on reddit, its a new shitcoin launched right after elon musks tweet"
1616773347,Shitcoin
1616773720,"shitcoin shitcoin but it brings in money, at least 6x by the end of next week"
1616774370,"It has a supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000 ElonGate"
1616774437,"yup, all the safemoon, safestar, safegalaxy etc. projects have huge supply"
1616774488,"safemoon has already given 6x, bet on 10x in 2 weeks"
1616774495,safestar 4x
1616774509,elongate 1x in 12h
1616774535,wtf is elongate
1616774611,see above
1616774655,"i'm not involved with the team, i like opportunities for trading"
1616774686,where can i sell sugarchain?

1616775850,@kittiewitty CHR looking tempting again

1616776632,CHR?
1616776638,CHR?
1616776654,It’s 0.40 now what do we expect ?:)
1616776738,Hopefully it goes up
1616776779,But we saw some big difficulties getting past 0.43 in the last couple weeks I think
1616776798,never trade on FOMO. that's how you get rekt on a trade.
1616776819,Why on fomo
1616776832,Buying the dip again after I sold higher
1616776874,FOMO emotions make us enter into bad trades.
1616776959,And with only 1/4
1616776969,It can still hit lower buying points :p
1616777421,Anyone know if I can send Nano to Coinbase Wallet (not Coinbase exchange)
1616777453,"Wallet theoretically allows any ERC20 coin, which Nano is?"
1616777461,Coinbase shit
1616777466,Kbye
1616777498,"Coinbase is shit, I'm taking about their hot wallet, not the exchange"
1616777525,ALGO will reach 2$ soon
1616777696,Pretty sure coinbase doesnt have full blown erc20 support just whatever they want
1616777714,Damn
1616777722,Might just buy 1 nano and send it as a test
1616778130,CHR looking good
1616778139,Lets make a new ath today

1616785843,buy matic rn
1616785848,instead
1616786221,500 is a safe next target imo
1616786240,May be a dip in between but you won't lose going in now overall
1616786455,"My dear friend, today was a sea of green and I didnt do a single trade.. dont fomo, all the trains had left the station"
1616786463,Just accept it and let it be

1616789399,I just open and close the stores
1616789408,You should see if your handbook requires clothes
1616789413,But on sunday nobody is there at opening time so I usually arrive in sweatpants
1616789442,Technically my job's handbook says nothing about clothing so they can't fire me for coming in nude #winning
1616789477,I think that falls under public indecency
1616789491,"8X on Elongate! To the Moon, boys! To the Moon!"

1616798917,Wondering the same about ANKR
1616799074,ANKR on the 1 min chart
1616799084,someone dropped the anchor there
1616799109,Hmmm
1616799110,"I'm fairly certain that it'll stay below 0,14, but I'm no expert"
1616799224,For the foreseeable future? 😮
1616799231,Because that’s not ideal...Lol
1616799251,Don't tell me you fomoed into ANKR *after* it pumped? 👀
1616799292,Whay does this ADA flag pettern mean?
1616799351,"No I didn’t renter, I entered on the call and just took profits from #🎓post-grads-podium :p"
1616799356,Now don’t know what to go into lol!
1616799374,not ANKR :kekw:  maybe CHR? It's cheap rn
1616799426,But I'm not sure
1616799436,"if it doesn't recover soon, the CHR saga might be over"
1616799478,"That’s what I’m really worried about, looks like it’s falling off a cliff.. :kekw:"
1616799502,"Which could be a good sign, but also a bad"
1616799518,"According to the bar BZRX is a good call, and a random guy on Twitter recommended XEM"
1616799543,"XEM looks juicy, quite low too"
1616799554,On the 1D
1616799607,"I also got recommended Uniti protocol, which is apparently something with significant (short term) potential on pancakeswap"
1616799681,Uggggh CHR what are you doing step-bro

1616800549,looks overbought
1616800554,"going up to 0,57 ?"
1616800558,"if i dont enter exactly when it breaks the wedge, i dont go int"
1616800876,"chz guys, is it still supposed to go up to at least 0.64-0.75 in the next 1-2 days ?"
1616800896,ANKR is climbing back up a bit

1616832985,I heard of stonks AI 2.0 that makes you rich overnight
1616834706,ADA is such a pump and dump coin. Podcast or random announcment - it rockets 15 - 20 cents up than slowly fades away till next announcment
1616834803,I disagree
1616834858,The difference this time compared to last is - bircoin didnt fell down the stairs
1616834859,ADA is relatively stable compared to the rest of the market
1616834877,It's like investing in USDT
1616834877,0.9-1.2 euro range
1616834886,cant wait for ADA to crash to the ground tbh
1616834893,will be fun to watch
1616834902,Not sure why people would put money in ADA unless you got in early
1616834905,Highly unlikely
1616834908,yes
1616834912,highly unlikely
1616834913,KEK

1616870398,That’s what I ment
1616870402,These people lie so much
1616870416,Elon tweeted to refer to every scam involving him as Elongate
1616870423,And people actually turned it into a scamcoin
1616870464,Yeah exactly the coin didn’t exist when he said it so by him saying that is false
1616870620,"Not Elon, that tiktok guy i posted above"
1616870654,Elon posted something to refer to his scandals as Elongate
1616870675,What is this ANKR thing
1616870683,and someone had a coin ready to be uploaded and needed a tweet like that to name it
1616870687,Each time I look it just gets higher
1616870722,ANKR partnered with Binance and such I believe
1616870730,And since then it’s just going up up up
1616870738,Waiting for a correction at this point
1616871073,Looks like I bet on the wrong horse again. 😦 I got out of ANKR yesterday to get back into CHR.

1616875271,I don't know what's wrong with them because all the scam calls I receive are from them. But I think I know 😅
1616875394,seems like mountainpumps is a scam
1616875419,"idk, but I saw nothing by observing the whole pump"
1616875454,All pumps are a scam
1616875477,bike pumps are ok
1616875807,went up like 30% or something
1616875813,the montain one
1616875978,"I feel you, I did the exact same thing mate"

1616877958,Every time I say I’m gonna bail on CHR it ends up flying up and every time I renter it drops so I’m just leaving it until disaster now lmao
1616878095,Just got kucoin and bitforex
1616878100,Anything I should be on the look for?
1616878140,idk man
1616878147,looks good on macd on rsi
1616878172,THIS
1616878260,Yeah that’s true. Hadn’t taken a look 🤔
1616878275,Everyone is mad just cause they couldnt get it. Facts are it is an amazing project
1616878378,Everyone is saying the lottery system is unfair and all. But with this much hype around an ico it is impossible to have a good system
1616878893,CAKE still going up🥞
1616879483,"I got some so for me all the hype is good, as I suppose would ""guaranty"" price beeing really good from  0.015 I got it for, though it will be locked for 18 month but same time it will give time for price to settle . I hope it will do really really really well!"
1616879527,oh yeah yummm
1616879534,0.015 is very unlikely. Even in a bear market
1616879543,i farmed 6 cakes in one month brr
1616879594,i suppose it cant be less then option 1 lol  u nevr know might be 0 of course in 18 monht.. but maybe it will be another File coin :))
1616879724,Could always be. But i am still a firm believer of the project and i see a good future ahead
1616879762,Especially along with further adoption of crypto in general
1616879774,"Firm believer in VET, ADA, DN, XLM, NANO"
1616879786,Casper is perfect blockchain for companies
1616879810,whats ur thoughts on price in 18 month.. u got some option 1 ? 0.015
1616879865,Noo i have option 3
1616879968,I dont want to do price speculation tho. But significant price appreciation is a not undoable
1616880010,We got promised a standard fcfs. They even said it when coinlist announced their lottery. The lottery was trash. People have successfully got into all three option with opening 50+ tabs while in the pre line iirc. Each tab had a different line number. No protection there. People were allowed to buy without having any money on coinlist. Ffs they didnt even require you to be logged in during the line which probably didnt help the mass queuing. People got kicked out when they were the next in line and had to start from the back. They could of easily changed option 3 to a lower max purchase but they kept it at 5k while they knew how shitty everything was. Coinlist and casper were too busy counting their money and going lol the system is fair and there are no flaws. Banning people who really hammered out the shitty system. It was a shitty ico. Only boson is probably going to beat them with that auction system
1616880101,"90% of this was coinlist but they definitely supported it and didnt say anything negative against coinlist. Just ""yes yes everything fine. Good system"""
1616880122,And ofcourse you got in so you will support them obviously
1616880131,Its more the behaviour from them
1616880149,I support them bc i believe in their project
1616880164,Why did you invest in casper in the first place?
1616880188,it was absolutely a shitty ico for what the project is
1616880207,The queue should of been ip logged. Only people with money and only people logged in. The system was just massively open for manipulation. And that is what happened
1616880224,That i agree^
1616880232,And now i can spend 0.5% on fees to get my money out :kekw:
1616880232,True
1616880251,If it wasn't then fuck you coinlist for being assholes
1616880261,Or account locked. People can still generate multiple IP's
1616880280,But the lottery system was the most fair system. Leaving the manipulation on the other side of this story
1616880285,Or keep it in for the MINA sale
1616880300,The fact that casper labs didnt even say the slightest bit negative about what happened. They didnt even acknowledge the massive cheating and fraud that was going on.
1616880306,That rubs me wrong
1616880323,I am not touching mina :kekw:
1616880329,i think with the amount of support and anticipation the project had
1616880345,That would be coinlists responsibility
1616880359,Casper put coinlist in charge of ico
1616880363,And? They can still speakup
1616880371,They can still say it was a bad system
1616880383,"What about syl, any info or they just gonna be behind 'Strasburg fire fucked us' all the time"
1616880415,"a login requirement to enter the queue, and no ""reserving"" for the token, only able to purchase with what you had in your account would have made it a lot simpler. the way to spoof the queue also was done through entering the site without being logged in"
1616880419,Well SYL has the benefit of the doubt since it was in the news
1616880431,I don't think Coinlist anticipated so many people would participate in the ICO. (they might've known a couple of days in advance but that's not enough to change the whole system)
1616880437,"likje, i underestand they probably didnt expect such a huge audiencfe"
1616880456,They knew very well how many people would show up. They knew how many people preregistered.
1616880473,They don’t give a fuck bro lol they made their money
1616880475,SYL dudes are on a yacht in Jamaica smoking some ganja
1616880478,Yup
1616880480,be back in 6 motnhs
1616880481,"How would they know about the manipulation? Without coinlist sharing, they would say it is a bad system based on speculation of people who didnt get in"
1616880511,People were literally posting themselves with mass tabs with different queue lists. People doing that posting about getting in
1616880517,"when u register, u should have put how much u can buy, then they could do lottery that would be more fair i think"
1616880524,And this was during option 1
1616880526,no that would be bad
1616880531,BTW any info which wallet it's going to be on? Seen some French comments mentioning one exchange but not sure
1616880549,will stocks plummet on monday given the suez canal block
1616880550,because the amount you want to invest is often an ongoing decision right up until the purcahse point
1616880555,with information you lean
1616880558,learn
1616880566,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoFR/comments/m53qw5/quel_wallet_pour_le_syl_xsl_labs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
1616880578,They should of just ditched option 2. Big whales could of done pre ico sales which happened iirc?
1616880590,option 2 is the most important one for them
1616880602,no way that was leaving
1616880641,If there were so many people and with option 1 being so oversaturated they should of spread the coins out instead of keeping a super whale option that like 40 people were able to do? And hace option 3 with a high max buy
1616880659,I know option 2 was even a bigger shit storm.
1616880678,plus their 60min pre listing line
1616880683,"for ""VIPS"""
1616880686,They would of sold those coins anyway
1616880691,its like am I a joke to u
1616880703,waited 60mins bbefore in the pre registered line and got spot 67k
1616880716,High minimum Limits does nothing but enable the rich to take part and keep the normies out.
1616880720,My friend got 280k
1616880762,I know i wasted 8 hours of my time on casper so i frankly dont give a fuck anymore.
1616880789,The only option is 100 bucks and that will be a shit show again anyway
1616880791,Calm down Elizabeth
1616880830,But whatever.
1616880845,I am just a dumb cunt so eh
1616880847,"This will be a agree disagree discussion. I got in and thats why my opinion is probably subjective. Casper put coinlist in charge of ico. The fact that it went bad has nothing to do with the project. Therefor I think it is unfair people judge casper for coinlists mistake. I get that you are mad. But be mad at coinlist. Also with this much hype, there is no good way to do a ico. There will always disappointed people. That is inevitable."
1616880847,Neither Casper or Coinlist expected such a high demand. Changing the whole system in 1 week is hard and I feel like they solved it decently with the lottery system. If you believe in the project you can just buy it when trading opens anyway
1616880870,I dont believe in any project
1616880887,The only believe i put in projects is profit
1616880903,What do i care if their system is great for companies
1616880910,How do you think these profit comes?
1616880918,In the end for us the only benefit is profits.
1616880918,Cause it is a good project
1616880925,Of course
1616880946,But would you invest in a coin with no purpose? Like safemoon?
1616880949,Or doge?
1616880999,For a quick bucks maybe. Not doge though. But them meme shitcoins if caught early can be profitable.
1616881022,"a lottery system is fine, they way they handled the lottery system was certainly subpar, thats all really"
1616881052,lottery systems have been used for high demand situations basically everywhere
1616881063,"as long as its handled well, thats fine"
1616881096,Most coins increase value because it is a good project.
1616881113,I am more pissed off at casper's inability to admit any flaw on what happened. There is no point for them to complain. I get it. They get the money either way. But their response was say shut up essentially and then ban people.
1616881247,AFAIK they nuked their discord. Banned a shit ton of people who were mad at how easy it was to cheat the queue
1616881293,And even now. After more proof of cheating happening they STILL dont acknowledge issues says alot about them imho
1616881665,Best ico ive seen so far was from wise
1616881676,Most fair
1616881707,syl's offerings have been dece from what i can tell
1616881729,Cause syl didnt have this much hype
1616881858,@hollowviper Can you please go ahead and give up on CHR? You're holding everyone else hostage 😦
1616881860,also that and the very lax buying times
1616881907,Sorry
1616882004,but I respect syl's method
1616882007,first come first served
1616882020,this!
1616882077,"Hey, was just wanting to know what people thought about OGN? Reliable?"
1616882194,"yes, it was is, come and buy... untill all sold out.. no day and time no Q pre Q.. and lottery.. ocne they sold, its sold. hence more happy people 🙂"
1616882219,yeah exactly
1616882222,I wanted to buy more
1616882228,but I didnt get there in time
1616882230,they sold out
1616882232,well thats life
1616882237,im satisfied
1616882241,im long on it
1616882245,i would think so
1616882260,What target you going for?
1616882308,"It was based on supply. If the same amount of people as casper tried to buy syl, it would also be unfair..."
1616882356,"never really thought about it, bought at 86cents will see what it does around $1.20; might sell and buy back in on dip"
1616882376,except they could buy it as soon as they found out about the project
1616882386,Got chr staked 😕

1616882682,Wtf happening to storj?
1616882706,Don’t!! I invested in that crap and it went stagnant on me

1616882795,Awesome stuff
1616882817,pump predictions for tomorrow?
1616882831,But if you read my message you will know I just copy and pasted it.
1616882891,"I'll give it a go, but I doubt I'll get in.... $100 is good as it allows more people in, but they should have reduced max for option 2 (max was $50 fkin k!?)"
1616882924,15K people can buy Casper now
1616882989,"Like i said, not judging you. Just trying to be careful. Dont want people to get rekt."

1616883771,"Student Coin had a good ICO idea, the longer you leave it, the higher the price etc..."
1616883792,I got it $0.0136 I think
1616883828,That’s the basis of every coin ever but
1616883864,"An alternative is having a registration window, getting numbers of registrations and dividing that by the numbers of coins available. And use that as the max per person"
1616883882,Not on an ICO
1616883918,I pass
1616883992,"But not all people will buy that max, and not everyone who registered will participate. So a lot of tokens will be left unsold in that case"
1616884011,But using the amount of registrations to adjust the max isn't a bad idea
1616884119,yeah but student coin looks sketchy to me
1616884120,idk
1616884122,might be wrong
1616884181,They seem to be adding more and more things to their eco system
1616884193,Actual developers developing things
1616884204,Unheard of I know 🤣
1616884226,I think because they're based in Poland and they're pretty hard working

1616888582,ENJ?
1616888585,"I listened to the enj-experts. At least 3$ by Friday. 🤡 I'm more careful now, but if CHR doesn't get it's chrt together I might even get liquidated on that. :kekw:"
1616888599,bro teach me ur ways

1616888636,We all take losses
1616888647,"I stuck to spot for CHR, just in case 😂"
1616888656,"I'm so close to liq, I won't survive a Sunday dive. But I'm keeping it open in case it recovers,it's only 40$ anyway"
1616888662,Best advice I can give all of you is to never Mary your trades
1616888666,prayers with you son
1616888691,Set your self a loss limit and stick to it like there is no tomorrow
1616888694,this month i turned 330€ to 200€ which isnt much but its weird it happened twice
1616888713,i got spit back to the start position
1616888730,An never over trade to recover your losses
1616888733,I’m futures but it’s a low ass leverage it may as well be spot
1616888769,trynna build this mentality
1616888780,we going down again i think
1616888785,but u dead ass did it this past week?
1616888790,so dont worry take a sit cause we staying a bit longer here

1616888829,😏
1616888845,Cheeky:)
1616888895,I just lost 60 bucks
1616888900,There you go
1616888941,"what TA were u focused on, to be able to do so well on such a shaky week?"
1616888945,@D6rk7
1616889468,SKY/NAS/IOTA/ALPHA/CELO/PNT all have great entry points for anyone wanting to do 3-5 day trades. Low value coins with super low volume that always pump 10-20% within a week. Ive made thousands doing this.
1616889629,Where’re you putting a sell on SKY? Haven’t checked it out for a while
1616889673,4900 right now. it hasnt been as much as a takeoff lately but still profit
1616889677,theres nothing sadder than looking away from 2 minutes
1616889679,and seeing this
1616889686,
1616889696,😢
1616889701,i swear that 20-40 btc volume daily shitcoins are great for profit
1616889705,distractions op
1616889708,they get pumped every few days
1616889734,I mainly go for the ones 1-3 dollars price
1616889738,actually i was looking at iota earlier
1616889751,looks attractive
1616889763,That volume and price is a perfect mix. They always pump within a few days
1616889769,Bitcoin overbought and crashing right now?
1616889769,Ive honestly made a lot doing this
1616889784,are you doing futures on any of those?
1616889801,After they pump. If theyre on futures i short them to
1616889814,so you futures on the way down?
1616889828,Yep i only like shorting.
1616889842,Bitcoin????
1616889848,Downwards?
1616889990,What are you even talking about
1616890025,its literally 55800. It started today off WAY lower.
1616890097,we were primarily in the 54000s most of today. I don't know where you are coming up with bitcoin crashing right now
1616890184,"a 2% dip over 2 hours and we get ""Is it crashing?!?"" god damn."
1616890249,not even 2%. Actual percent drop from the high we hit on this push to now: 1.5%
1616890462,i'll never get tired of saying this
1616890464,fuck SKY
1616890470,and yeah i lost big in it
1616890474,how
1616890474,😂
1616890477,lol
1616890479,doomp
1616890484,it pumps every few days
1616890488,long ago
1616890491,ohhhh
1616890495,back in the golden age of BPS
1616890497,i did to
1616890526,but its made me more back so its won my heart
1616891585,where is crypto domme to reassure us on holding on to CHR 😄
1616891591,coz that chr bitch is diving 😄
1616891896,yeah lol..
1616892240,storj still not quitting 💪🏻
1616893064,Anyone thought about staking adx?
1616893068,do you just buy in and then open a limit sell and hope it pumps in the next few days?
1616893234,Yes. And these low volume coins between 1-3 Dollars will always pump within a few days. Because it doesn't take much to pump a 20 to 40 btc volume per day coin.
1616893264,interesting
1616893274,when do you find the best time to buy in is?
1616893347,A few days after a pump when it's back near the bottom average. Then you shouldn't wait many days to take profit.
1616893814,"I keept a close eye on BTC price action and patiently wait for an impulse move in either direction. I monitor support and resistance levels and go with the general trend of the chart. I do not overstay my welcome and as soon I am in profit between 60 to 150 bucks, I end my trade with a few exceptions."
1616893862,"By the way, I made this back and my account is at $1457 now."
1616894003,"I pretty much scalped my way up. I generally look at 4H charts too dictate the overall trend of the trade and then move my way down to 2H, 1H, 30M and all the way to 5M. I usually enter my trades using  either 15M or 30M period charts"
1616894064,Obviously I always do my technical analysis as well and try to spot different chart patterns and candle stick patterns
1616894134,"But the most important thing is. I only take a couple of trades per day and when I make anything close to 150 bucks, I stop trading that day"
1616894234,"That’s a really smart way to trade in all honesty, something I aspire to do and get good at"
1616894614,"The other thing is, when I trade, I only risk 25% of my account."
1616894632,25% is way too high for beginners
1616894744,"You can easily get liquidated, but I manage all my position like a hawk. As soon as I see signs of the trades going against me, I am out of it."
1616894755,Im too high but im not a beginner
1616894828,😂 👍 👍
1616895063,Wassup
1616895066,Talk to me
1616895070,How’s y’all alts doing
1616895079,STORMx still nothing
1616895117,I actually longed stmx today. It weas a bad idea :kekw:
1616895127,Liquidated while i was working
1616895132,This THETA long might be a bad idea
1616895143,STORMx is your best hold
1616895155,Do you know what you’re investing in @That one belgian super cunt
1616895161,STORMx.io
1616895175,"@D6rk7 out of interest, and you of course don’t have to answer this, but what was your original deposit amount compared to where you’re at now with an almost $1500 balance :p"
1616895181,Dude. You cant hold a future if you get liquidated
1616895209,Don’t understand
1616895228,"This^ I get so many people all the time that say ""you don't lose if you dont sell"" like shut yo face. I had no say in this"
1616895239,And i have stmx
1616895250,Which i bought at 20ish satoshi
1616895251,im too high closeing discord now
1616895275,Btt is almost a x 3 :kekw:
1616895278,I entered BTT at 0.0033 - I bet you entered ages ago and made a huge ass profit already
1616895282,Yeah lmao
1616895293,What’s liquidation
1616895297,I’m pretty new
1616895299,I bought 100 bucks worth of btt and iirc 150 of stmx
1616895302,"Bel, do you have a TP for BTT?"
1616895306,Like what does it have to do with holding
1616895341,Tf is satoshi
1616895344,Mini Bitcoin
1616895432,instead of saying 0.000105 we say 105 satoshi
1616895438,Cool
1616895440,Thanks
1616895453,I think @That one belgian super cunt explained yesterday but I forgot
1616895476,50 bucks
1616895499,"Wow, that’s very impressive"
1616895512,And for how long have you been doing this? 😮
1616895516,Futures is a contract where you bet on increase or decrease of price. Long is increase. Short is decrease. You pick a leverage. So X10 is you put in 100 bucks but your buying power is leverages by 10 so 1000 bucks. If entry point is 1 dollar and you do a X10 long your profit when the coin goes up(incase of a long) by one percent is 1% or 50%if you do a X 50 long. So 10% increase doubles your profit. But if the coin goes in the opposite direction when it hits -10% you get liquidated. You lose everything. Because your 100 dollars is 0 and binance doesnt allow negatives UNLESS you add money to your margin.
1616895545,Oooh
1616895556,A couple of years.
1616895567,Okay 👌
1616895573,So on X10. 1.1 dollars from entry point is 100% profit 0.9 is liquidation
1616895575,Kinda like options
1616895614,I could of added 100 more bucks in margin but eh it was dropping too fast. Didnt want to risk losing another 100 bucks
1616895617,Ima try day trading tomorrow  night
1616895630,Risky on a sunday evening
1616895635,Why
1616895644,Sundays and mondays tend to be volatile
1616895649,Okay
1616895659,Friday’s are good?
1616895679,Monday because stock markets open and their performance can affect btc negatively
1616895691,Sundays probably go bearish in prep for that situation
1616895700,This is not written rule though
1616895722,If the stock market is very positive and the economy is having a green day it tends to reflect good on btc
1616895751,Which tends to increase alt prices. Unless btc rises SO HARD that people fomo and sell alts to buy btc
1616895905,Interesting play
1616895944,Have people fomo to sell btc
1616896211,why tho? most alts seem to mirror or follow btc
1616896317,Except for that one time ADA went to ath during a btc crash
1616896358,Ankr moving.  I’m all in on ckb and stmx.  These are long term holds for me
1616896918,yo my THETA is almost green
1616896924,😂
1616896941,one of the stupidest trades sober Jeremy has ever done
1616896948,like who buys THETA amirite
1616896976,Man if only I traded while I was high. I am sure I could pick way better coins then sober Jeremy

1616939740,True. Trading should be emotions-free
1616939743,"i guess the question is, is this the result of a bad trade already, or just in a bad situation?"
1616939828,That’s why I converted everything in my binance account into pure $$$$

1616946955,"Today is the last phase of ICO that is running (Phase 100) and is the last chance to participate in the ICO. As I write this the price of one STC is 0.0171 USD if you want to invest in ICO and the coin is also listed in coin tiger and Uniswap and it is trading at around 0.0195 USD which is around a 14% price hike already. I have invested in phase 99 after researching about the project and exploring the whitepaper. It's still not late to invest in the project as it's still profitable. The current phase (phase 100) is the last phase that is running which has a cap of 2.8 million USD. So hurry up 🙂

1616947345,@David R. don't hold any Futures position open too long. Take your profit even if it's small and repeat it. That's how you will build up your account

1616952021,"pump groups "" second wave incomming, buy the dips NOW ( we need to sell it all to you retards ) "" 😄"
1616952045,mfuckers 😄
1616952045,they have already sold in the first 10seconds
1616952079,i am sure they were riding waves as well tho 🙂 with like 10% of their starting investment in it 🙂
1616952117,ty
1616952130,"but it doesnt matter, calling a second wave on a 1-2 min pump just goes further and further on the scam artists they are.."
1616952207,they do this for the exact oppsotie reasons
1616952214,to show that they are not scamming them
1616952217,😛
1616952227,The Alerts BOT picked it up
1616952230,rofl
1616952298,Didn't think that Pump/Dump schemes could go so far that people are using them to scam others.
1616952362,yes
1616952372,Did y’all see the pump on pixl
1616952378,Discord niggas
1616952398,"not bad, 75%?"
1616952451,noice
1616952529,they clamed that  it will go up to 500%  and at the of the coin it's already up
1616952643,it was also announced on #🟧senior-alerts  🙂 5mn before
1616952673,nice sell
1616952683,Which bots are you all using on these pumps?
1616952690,i got out at around 0.00009
1616952712,for ~30pc
1616952742,i lost big on pivx yikes
1616952745,I did it manually holding about 10 sec with 20% profit. Not been greedy is the key
1616952752,my own
1616952784,Did you manually type coin in or did it detect the pump and then buy for you?
1616952815,i look for volume or price movement close to an hour mark
1616952831,"same, used my own"
1616952836,i used to scrape from discord but i find that is slower
1616952861,these pumps spend so much energy on captchas and avoiding scraping
1616952888,"if they wanted to fuck bot makers they should schedule their pumps for ten past, lmapo"
1616952905,What's it written in?
1616952939,"my first was in python, the current one is in c#.net"
1616952951,there are plenty of libs on github
1616953011,"Yeah I made a pump detection script in PHP but didn't complete it to actually buy yet, I don't trust it just yet. Also I need an interaction bit to sell when I hit enter or something"
1616953035,"unfortuantely i live far away, where i cant supervise my bot lol"
1616953050,this 1am bot is unusually convenient hahaha
1616953054,anyone know any good binance auto trading bots?
1616953061,"most pumps are like, 4am"
1616953075,so i need to make it fully automated
1616953101,"ive woken up to carnage, sometimes"
1616953109,Haha I bet
1616953121,but my bot is quite conservative
1616953135,i buy only if im quite sure its a pump
1616953190,have a nice weekend chat
1616953213,@kiterdekel what group announced that fast?
1616953337,Telegram groups announced at 6:00:04
1616953407,"oh, so his bot didn't scan the group, his bot detected the pump"
1616953438,#🔴senior-alerts-ping 5mn before
1616953450,whcih bot ?
1616953478,kiterdekel's bot
1616953529,"he showed screen with purchase at 6:00:02, but the group announced in 6:00:04"
1616953546,xD
1616953597,My bot got in at 00:01
1616953603,"My man here did get it right with the pixv breakout, got me a good stack of cash"
1616953613,But the pump fucked everything lmao
1616953654,"my profit was shit, like 10%, because my bot scans the telegram :))"
1616953814,my bot bought at 02s too
1616953826,based on volume
1616953881,"mmm, got it"
1616953886,whats the best bot to use for binance?
1616953887,i played around with scraping discord channels
1616953894,but i found it was slower tbh
1616953918,"telegram scrapping is fast, but I like your idea 🙂"
1616953926,Why is it faster?
1616953934,they have API
1616953967,I scrape both Discord and Telegram. It's pretty much down to which one they post 1st on
1616954008,how do you scrap Discord?
1616954028,i never messed with telegram
1616954040,I don't use the standard go-to API 😉
1616954051,but i find that the activity on binance is always faster than the public post lmao
1616954063,cos the admins are always doin their bs hahaha
1616954102,"i watch for something to rise 10pc in <5s, near an hour mark"
1616954108,ezpz
1616954127,"or, to have crazy volume, around an hour mark"
1616954143,"Indeed - I store all trades up to the pump, but I don't do any analysis on it... too lazy to extend the code TBH"
1616954161,and im scanning the 100 lowest cap coins on binance
1616954181,which i scraped from the site back in the day lol
1616954300,"My discord timestamp was: 
2021-03-28T17:00:**04**.031000+00:00"
1616954382,for some reason ADA is trending in belgium
1616954395,It’s a sign 😮
1616954453,
1616954468,africa deal happening soon. just needs to be signed by the prime minister
1616954556,for some reason i cant paste but my binance timestamp is 2s past
1616954619,lmao and apparently imgur is banned here?
1616954622,how unchadly
1616954672,"You need to be Junior to post links, check #🔼ranks"
1616954974,The combination of Belgium and Africa kind of gives me bad vibes
1616955017,im not announcing plans to increase my rank at this time
1616955052,Thanks for this. I always wondered what the right setting was when detecting pumps
1616955071,I'm doing 8% in 15 sec
1616955093,15sec would be too slow though?
1616955109,Or does it still work ok
1616955116,It works very well
1616955126,Bought at 00:01
1616955134,Nice
1616955156,How do you sell? Manual or hardcoded %
1616955166,Hardcoded
1616955188,Manual sell was a traumatic experience
1616955248,please dont use me as your right setting....who knows
1616955276,i do think the 'near an hour' thing is good tho
1616955281,"It's good to know what others use. I'm starting from scratch.

You can long ADA on futures market with  3x leverage. Than it would have to go down below 0.9 to get you liquidated. But keeping it in spot wallet is also great. ADA will go to 5€ by the end of August. Smart contracts, solid development plan. Really promising coin"
1616964830,Suit yourself. Thought to share a gem with you but dyor always
1616964910,Ok sir...smart to put 150 innit??
1616965010,one/usdt 🚀
1616965031,Yeah. ADA has been very stable and wont go below 1.00  even last week when BTC dipped hard  it touched 0.98 for a brief moment and than quickly went up. I think it is very stable long term investment. Wont jump up overnight but wont fall either
1616965072,too late to get some ONe?:)
1616965112,"very hard to say, i been in since yesterdat but a quick trade is possible"

1616965478,looking for a breakout out of the flag
1616965578,I think it is better to diversify your portfolio. Last pic looked better for long term imo.
1616965901,guys what do you think about PlanB last news?
1616965918,Yea holding Ada long term
1616965961,I meant before you want all in on ada

1616970578,which is 10
1616970616,"You need to pay maker/taker fees on the amount you borrow, which is in that case $500"
1616970636,i think he is talking about government taxes not binance fees
1616970650,And taxes on the fiat you pull out of the exchange. USDT is not fiat
1616970684,"So unless you withdraw $ or € or something, you don't pay any taxes. At least that's how it is in my country."
1616970705,Anyone know the law in the UK
1616970719,Go on Gov website
1616970723,Go on the .gov website it says it all
1616970814,I’ll have a look
1616970893,You don't need to pay taxes on futures leverage I think. You maybe only pay taxes on the net profits you make while trading
1616970901,Just don't pay them
1616970905,Oh... UK says every exchange is taxable. So I'd think they tax futures as well.
1616970940,"Any Crypto is considered ""income tax"""
1616970951,"Yes, on the *profits* from a futures trade. Not on the borrowed amount, that would be insane."
1616970962,
1616970985,I assume whatever you profit on  futures would be taxable
1616971190,lol
1616971195,paying taxes :/

As I write this the price of one STC is 0.0171 USD if you want to invest in ICO and the coin is also listed in coin tiger and Uniswap and it is trading at around 0.0195 USD which is around a 14% price hike already. I have invested in phase 99 after researching about the project and exploring the whitepaper. It's still not late to invest in the project as it's still profitable.

1617009300,"you borrow money from the broker, for example you have 10 eu and use 10x you have 100. But if you lose 10 euros of that 100 you lost are you money. but if you win 10 euros on that 100 euros you double your money"
1617009361,"thanks been trying to learn all this, without asking too many questions"
1617009446,"However the larger the ""borrowing amount"" the closer the liquidity price will be on your trade, which is why using anything above 5x is offlimits for more, cause one single wick can liquify you (depending on your amounts)"

1617020306,Are coinbase new listings announcements something regular or out of the blue?

1617020340,they seem to happen every Tuesday around 5pm GMT

1617022985,why buy storj? What's so great about that will make it fly
1617022995,Because data storage worldwide
1617023001,With tokenized incentive
1617023010,What's the PT?
1617023016,The major draw is that they only see the token as a means of funding and compensating
1617023019,PT?
1617023033,Penis Tickle?
1617023045,No the price target. how much can it hit.
1617023081,I haven’t got a clue
1617023134,Storj does provide $60 a year per 1tb stored
1617023161,So if you run a server or have unused storage space you can function as node so to speak
1617023190,Everything says quit whilst you’re ahead
1617023270,how does futures work? I don't understand
1617023341,Basically you’re forecasting which direction the coin will go and putting money on it
1617023345,Educated gambling
1617023393,hola
1617023402,Also looking @hollowviper
1617023411,Also doubting what to do
1617023413,:p
1617023435,"And dropping again, to late lol"
1617023482,Its very similar to owning the coin except you dont own the coin. Everything is connected to the position and you can take leverage out multiplying your profits and losses
1617023522,ohh
1617023530,"Only thing is when your lossed equal your amount put in, the position is closed automatically. Unlike stock options, you cant go into debt with crypto futures"
1617023551,"Back below 0,4 meh"
1617023551,And crypto futures are perpetual meaning you can open and close them at any time
1617023555,So it's not recommended to people like me. Because i'm broke af
1617023621,Its not recommended to inexperienced traders. The amount you have doesn’t really matter. I have singlehandedly taught my best friend crypto in a few days and she is already up 100% on her portfolio using futures leverage
1617023650,"And not only that, she is using safe leverage too. She isnt 125xing things. Shes 2-4xing things max"
1617023657,It’s been doing that all day but it’s a good sign it’s staying around 0.39-0.4
1617023711,And she started out with only 100$. 100$->200$ in 4 days is not bad for a new trader
1617023750,On a side note can DOT stop teasing me and just get to 35$ already to hit my tp lol
1617023764,Its been 34.30-34.70 all morning
1617023799,Binance has my number and they are strategically keeping me from hitting my tps
1617024350,any LTC investors?
1617024633,$reef to the moon folks dont miss out
1617024634,"im only spot at the moment, but once i feel confident, going to try very low level futures and build"
1617025128,So cloooosr
1617025175,We dont FOMO here
1617025256,https://www.tradingview.com/x/j6X8KaOU/
1617025259,Its against the rules. You are welcome to teach people about reef but we dont do the “dont miss out” limited time offer fomoing. Thats how you fuck over new traders who end up buying at the top because of your message
1617025315,congrats ur in the green :godsgardener:

1617025414,does any do any of the binance battles?
1617025419,@Jeremyfto what do u think about binance earn?
1617025423,curious on what they are
1617025446,Havent looked into it
1617025473,Binance battles is a fun minigame where you are gambling on btc going up or down in the next 5 minutes
1617025484,You get paired against someone who has the opposite opinion
1617025504,"Whoever wins gets a tiny little bit of btc and whoever loses, loses a tiny little bit of btc"
1617025520,Its not for money making. Its just for fun
1617025521,Sounds like a fun way to loose my money
1617025530,Off to go play
1617025535,any thoughts on HNT and STORJ?
1617025550,potential accumulation periods?

1617025973,are we making a HNT pact and going in balls deep?
1617025975,let me know
1617026008,some guy this morning was mentioning HNT
1617026095,"Not anymore, it just hit my SL this second"
1617026195,my condolences
1617026212,"Soo I was about to buy my first cryptos, but everything is rising... Should I wait?"
1617026232,nobody knowz
1617026239,some predict a bulls market untill september
1617026245,BTC reaching 100k before a bear market
1617026257,could be next week
1617026426,"It's ok, better than getting liquidated. 😄 To me it looks like HNT lost its momentum, but it hasn't gone below the previous low yet."
1617026533,If it breaches its current support
1617026534,Im out
1617026544,But ill buy in at the support point
1617026560,Unless theres another promising coin on a dip today
1617026565,Im a bit late 😪
1617026738,thank god the market goes into a dip every 2 weeks
1617026751,STORMx to the moon
1617026762,"you mean 9,84?"
1617026808,Yes sirrr
1617026828,If it bounces off from there 2x it’s promising
1617026836,3x = moon to me
1617026880,Anyone know about $SHA? (safehaven) I’m interested in it but haven’t heard of it from anyone else
1617027695,Is FTM still a good buy here?

1617028179,where is ANKR going
1617028444,btc looks good to hit a new ath this week
1617028474,"lots of stablecoins being introduced, and btc supply on exchanges is decreasing"
1617028640,"same, looks like a real good buy here"
1617028658,was gonna margin but binance wouldn't allow me
1617029131,What's happening to CHZ? Still a hold?
1617029162,waiting for new deals
1617029170,deals / partnerships
1617029600,BRD looks really good long term
1617029612,look at daily/ weekly charts
1617029655,why buy stmx when u can short it
1617029821,Yes
1617030959,
1617031240,I am not a huge fan of shorting tbh because there is a higher chance of losing money tbh. The market will eventually always go up UNLESS the coin itself dies so there is no staying through the red with shorting. Eventually that position will be irredeemable. Shorting is great and I am not knocking it but its just not for me as I dont have the safety net of making up for a bad trade with natural market recovery and trends that come with longing
1617031279,but I also do longer trades so Im probably the minority tbh
1617031404,Nice call man 👍  🚀
1617031473,@RichySnipes Looks like we'll know now
1617031474,Decent 8% today but I think it's got huge potential
1617031570,I sold again @hollowviper
1617031579,The CHR rollercoaster continues
1617031720,"I'll say it again that KuCoin trading bot is amazingly good. I put $400 into VRA at 0.0236. it fell well below since then for 12 days, only today it's got back to 0.0236. but in that time it made me $65?! How the hell it even works is beyond me, but it's great."
1617031775,
1617031911,Nice! Thats actually not too bed
1617032242,It sure has its risk factor.
1617032618,storj undervalued?
1617032885,Storj? Yeah
1617032904,With their business model and long term future perspective I think it can grow a lot
1617032914,I bought some to hold today
1617032929,30x? What a madman
1617033324,"ada and stmx been so quite last few days, this a good sign?"
1617033361,STMX gonna explode soon
1617033616,fingers crossed it does
1617033767,I pray for that
1617033773,Hot is Goin up rn
1617034031,This is tense hahaha
1617034542,I just got kucoin yesterday to get into UOS. Noticed the bot and very intrigued
1617034946,Will signup this time!
1617035049,"I got into HOT this morning at .0104, had a hunch and wasn't wrong 😼"
1617035404,Reef comen
1617035769,Is exodus shit ?
1617035808,Not fomo was a call look now bud
1617035877,"Today is the last phase of ICO that is running (Phase 100) and is the last chance to participate in the ICO. As I write this the price of one STC is 0.0171 USD if you want to invest in ICO and the coin is also listed in coin tiger and Uniswap and it is trading at around 0.0195 USD which is around a 14% price hike already. I have invested in phase 99 after researching about the project and exploring the whitepaper. It's still not late to invest in the project as it's still profitable. The current phase (phase 100) is the last phase that is running which has a cap of 2.8 million USD. So hurry up 🙂
Student Coin ICO, use the referral code for investing or sign up to get a 5% bonus: Sx8dzz6rl2"
1617035897,That’s literally the worst copy pasta I have seen so far
1617035917,Look at #📜rules bud. We don't do calls
1617035938,"```- Don't tell people to buy into coins or any type of investment. A lot of new members come here looking for advice, telling them to buy into your bags is a big no-no. Instead, our vetted @Post Grad's give premium signals for upgraded users.
```"
1617035957,If you want to provide TA to back up a coin fine but we dont do signals here
1617035959,Or atleast post Somebody well founded :p
1617035968,Not random coin will moon soon
1617035992,Yah I ask for research and backing when somebody shills
1617036032,I have almost hit all my targets
1617036035,You cant just say BUY BUY BUY. That isn't healthy TA nor is it useful to new crypto people. Either post research or don't post at all. We don't do shilling because it literally adds no value to someone's crypto knowledge and is dangerous to get new people hooked on
1617036038,What to buy now
1617036081,Well sorry but im new here and was just trying to help.
1617036089,Will btc dip this evening 🤔
1617036091,any tips on what to do for a  new person ?
1617036100,any videos or something
1617036101,Read this discord
1617036104,Read articles
1617036112,I don’t really understand too much
1617036126,See what’s trending on Twitter etc
1617036141,ok cool
1617036164,like when Elon musk tweets about doge coin and stuff just buy it 😂
1617036165,Its ok to be new but signals are not the way to go for anyone. The people who post signals are making the people who are taking the signals reliant on the signaler's TA which a lot of times is nonexistant. We teach DYOR here
1617036171,Do Your Own Research
1617036195,Dont buy dogecoin :p
1617036246,Ok so not oly should i post resesrch but i should be posting in a different channel? Just trying to make sure i understand.
1617036263,#1 piece of advice right here 🤣
1617036270,i am mining monero at just hashes per second
1617036272,am i cool
1617036284,You dont have to post it in a different channel. We just don't do shilling here. You can explain why you want to buy into a coin. You can show your research but you cant say BUY BUY BUY
1617036285,no megahashes no nothing
1617036289,nor can you say SELL SELL SELL
1617036292,Ive been researching the coi. for months n havd all the info to back if needed.
1617036297,Ok fair enough
1617036312,What should I buy Jeremy? I got fomo from seeing that statement
1617036479,$boobs
1617036482,"I personally have bags in BTC, LUNA, BNB, and NANO. BTC is pretty obvious, LUNA I believe in as a long term hold primarily because they have built in coin burn based on mining rate so eventually the coin burn will catch up the the supply which will increase its value in theory, BNB I have because its backed by Binance and Binance has a large amount of funds and can rig the game from their end"
1617036484,😎
1617036512,NANO I enjoy as a long term coin because its free to transfer. Its hard to beat that with fiat
1617036522,Binance is also one of the best platforms in terms of rating afaik
1617036562,Every coin that I buy I do my own research on. I will say right now is probably a poor time to buy into most things because of the BTC spike last night though
1617036578,"Basically every coin spiked with BTC and with spikes, come corrections"
1617036591,we are already seeing a bit of corrections in a few coins
1617036624,dont buy high and sell low everyone. Buy low and sell high; Careful with your purchases today
1617036672,"I swear, waiting on chr to go back to ath is giving me depression"
1617036705,"NANO might be a decent buy right now though cause its under 5$ primarily due to the DDOS attack they had 2 weeks ago. A large amount of exchanges including Binance locked withdrawing. Once NANO fixes this and the withdrawing is unlocked, I see a small bump in its price in the future"
1617036748,"It takes quite a bit to affect NANOs price so I don't think its going to be a large spike by any means but I do think it will gain some of the value it lost, back when it becomes transferable again"
1617036757,For sure.. look at cake.. it died and came back from the grave
1617036779,Also it came back in big style
1617036850,would be awesome for my small bag of NANO if we get replicated results but I'm not getting excited about it by any means. Keeping my hopes down even though my expectation is it will go up just because I dont plan on selling even if it does go up. I am long holding this coin
1617036885,but ya those are my 4 bags and why I own them!
1617036928,"Like I said, DYOR and be careful about buy ins right now. Hope everyone becomes blessed with profit like I was this morning 🙂"
1617036955,Mtl going to be pumped?
1617036965,5 minutes before the hour
1617037190,Luna is going to be huge
1617037324,I hope so. Its my second biggest bag
1617037334,BTC being my first of course
1617037364,Its at least my EOY YOLO. TP at 100$ even though I don't think we will get that high. One can always dream haha
1617037399,"regardless of where it is, I have faith I will make a decent chunk of change holding it till december"
1617037685,I missed hnt’s little pump 😫
1617037690,I was asleep
1617037706,Anyone seen any other coins in the red
1617037724,Every fibre of my being is wanting me to pull out of CHR whilst I’m up hahaha this is an absolute test
1617037745,To pull out or to stay in
1617037753,Thats the question
1617037772,I asked your mother that question 9 months before your birth
1617037781,Turns out staying in was a bad call
1617037870,😂
1617037872,@hollowviper stop holding back chr
1617037880,Leave so it can moon
1617037885,:kekw:
1617037943,NEVER
1617037959,My TP is 1.00 we leave then
1617037962,Guess we going back to 0.367
1617037963,lmao no it isn’t
1617037965,:kekw:
1617038203,mine too 🙂
1617038247,I need to rebuy chr guys
1617038254,A drop to 0.38 would be nice
1617038505,i won't exit until 1.0
1617038690,When do you think that’ll happen
1617038700,nfi lol
1617038802,Sheer optimism then
1617038855,@Jeremyfto @Sensai take a look at Klaytn/GroundX if you like Luna
1617039073,Ill look deeper into it as it looks intriguing but unfortunately KLAY isnt on Binance Futures which is where I almost exclusively trade. I own some NANO on spot but thats about it for my spot wallet
1617039098,That doesn't make it a bad coin. It just might not be the right fit for me. Im gonna read its white paper real quick
1617039375,Alright so I am a big fan of it so far reading up on it with a few minor things that I dislike. First off their goal is too broad and too niche. Their official goal is ```Klaytn’s mission is to become the first blockchain solution to bring blockchain mass adoption to the world.```
1617039398,Sure thats all fine and dandy but thats like every single blockchain's goal isn't it?
1617039422,"Their goal is basically ""we want our blockchain to succeed"". Okay..."
1617039445,i agree lol
1617039457,but they are backed by too crazy of a company
1617039464,which makes me think they can do it
1617039477,@Jeremyfto bro get good
1617039478,I do like that it's road map isn't super far off in the distance. They are suppose to be entirely finished with their project this year which is cool
1617039490,How have u not gotten the tesla if u exclusively trade on futures
1617039496,What are u doing jeremy 🤣
1617039501,kakao talk and samsung
1617039512,I'm 10k in so far from the 1k I started on so Im working my way up
1617039538,Nah Im kidding
1617039545,Slow and steady stays away from liquidation
1617039553,Lambo soon
1617039560,https://tenor.com/view/vet-xvet-vechain-thor-crypto-gif-20670298
1617039568,I lowkey saw a guy say that BTC will hit 30k this year on another server
1617039578,Its true
1617039584,Leave while u still can
1617039585,lowkey saw u say you got scammed and lowkey saw u beg for money here
1617039603,i lowkey tro... nothing to say
1617039618,😂
1617039673,"Bitcoin is projected to hit 100k by 87% of the population and I believe it. regardless, april is suppose to be a good month. Contracts expiring at the 80000$ mark meaning there is likely to be a push for that mark and historically bitcoin has done well in april"
1617039723,"Not to mention, most people bring zero facts into a discussion when talking about bullish and bearish tendencies and when they do bring facts, they normally wrap their facts in with what they WANT to happen"
1617039754,"I know I have read many articles, but I think April will be a healthy month for BTC, like some bitcoins are going to expire isn't it? And that will make Bitcoin dip as hell in mid 45k..."
1617039802,check bitcoin.com
1617039806,That isn't how this works. Contracts don't hold bitcoin. They are predictions on a price point. The only thing lost when a contract expires is money
1617039807,and then search expire
1617039812,Stonks
1617039814,You are by far
1617039823,The most uninformed person I’ve seen in recent times
1617039827,dawg
1617039834,bitcoin is going to go 80k in april
1617039841,Not exactly true
1617039841,And hiw
1617039851,But there will be a push for it
1617039858,The incentive to push is there
1617039861,As it is possible
1617039862,because there are contracts that expire at the 80000$ price point
1617039865,It's targeted to hit 80k this month (APRIL)
1617039881,Drstonks
1617039882,Tell me
1617039889,What is driving bitcoins value
1617039896,doritos?
1617039911,number go up
1617039912,liquidating leverage shorts
1617039924,Its not targeted to hit 80k this month by predictions. Its targeted by contract expirations so you are slightly correct but not in the sense you think
1617039944,aka that is the price point that people who have long contracts are targetting and what they will push for
1617039960,so that is what some people are betting on their futures acc?
1617040000,eth is run by doritos right?
1617040011,I read an article and it said it will hit 10k next week
1617040012,Bouta rob my granny and put her life savings on btc hitting 80k
1617040015,no cheetos
1617040019,and ada to hit 50k in 2 weeks
1617040022,I can’t tell if you’re a troll or genuinely incompetent
1617040025,because ada runs by doritos
1617040035,BRO ADA IS DORITOS
1617040036,Both
1617040038,ADA = DORITOS
1617040040,DORITOS = ADA
1617040045,That means people likely bet on it a while ago and now they are going to try to manipulate the market so they dont lose money
1617040059,DORITOS = ADA
1617040068,Honest please stop you’re lowering my IQ and it’s already dangerously low
1617040073,1 doritos = 1 ada
1617040075,but we saw this on the opposite end of the spectrum on friday. Lots of bears wanted to push for the 45k sector and that didn't happen
1617040097,"just because people WANT something to occur, doesn't mean its going to. It just means there will be more of a push for it"
1617040097,We can climb up to his ego and jump down to his iq to get out of this world
1617040100,how about 3d doritos?
1617040104,...
1617040117,I have no doubt april will be a good month for bitcoin but I don't know about the 80000$ price point
1617040129,What is ur personal price target for btc?
1617040155,78k just in case there is the buying power there to push to the 80k mark. I get off the train a little early to miss the big crowd
1617040202,"Im not reliant on that price point hitting nor am I expecting it but if there is enough power to push for the 80k mark, then I am going to take profit near it but not at it"
1617040231,I do expect bitcoin to do well in april but no one knows HOW well.
1617040231,@Jeremyfto what leverage do you usually use?
1617040242,125x
1617040245,why are we talking about 80k already
1617040255,Depends on my buy in spot. I bought in low enough on bitcoin to be able to do 15x
1617040257,let's break 65k first
1617040258,Because we need to have something to do while we feel the money flow in
1617040283,Usually hostages but if not anything can work
1617040286,Because that is where the contracts expiring in april are and I was explaining why its bad to expect it to be 80k by end of april
1617040301,there is a misconception that contracts expiring at x point means it will for sure hit x point
1617040316,The only misconception was his birth
1617040322,Okay enough burns for today
1617040329,Time to burn some money
1617040330,ah okay
1617040330,so the talk is clarification on the fact that there will more than likely be pressure for it to go up but not to expect 80k
1617040462,Anyone know anything about spark/flare
1617040502,I am trying to figure out if I need to do anything to claim the tokens if I already had my XRP on a supported exchange during the snapshot
1617041707,"@felguerr Thank you my man for recommending DENT!
I went 3x leverage on this one and it's paying off bigly 😉"
1617041780,You hear that everyone? Drinks are on Sane tonight!!!!
1617042437,this eth news is doing work for matic
1617042945,@SeineJanie Is it a good time to buy DENT now?
1617043007,Went into DNT instead
1617043008,Sadly
1617043009,Rekt
1617043026,probably better below 0.01
1617043106,Also what's the prognostication for CHR?
1617043128,who was the person that shilled me into buying STORJ today
1617043131,not a good call :p
1617043150,I'm holding spot CHR but no DENT
1617043197,"Today is the last phase of ICO that is running (Phase 100) and is the last chance to participate in the ICO. As I write this the price of one STC is 0.0171 USD if you want to invest in ICO and the coin is also listed in coin tiger and Uniswap and it is trading at around 0.0195 USD which is around a 14% price hike already. I have invested in phase 99 after researching about the project and exploring the whitepaper. It's still not late to invest in the project as it's still profitable. The current phase (phase 100) is the last phase that is running which has a cap of 2.8 million USD. So hurry up 🙂

1617043268,
1617043287,When are the dips coming I wanna buy 😫
1617043331,NEVER ITS GOING TO KEEP GOING UP AND THERE WILL BE NO STOPPING IT! ALL COINS ARE GOING TO A BILLION DOLLARS A COIN AND BEYOND
1617043362,(Disclaimer: This is satirical and sarcastic. Do not take the above message as real advice or TA)
1617043365,Wise words
1617043378,I think I'll wait for btc to be 70k and then buy
1617043401,We may see that this month. there are contracts expiring at the end of april at the 80k mark
1617043409,doesnt mean its for sure going that high
1617043413,but theres gonna be a push for it
1617043422,HODL
1617043469,Honselty im u sure now if I should buy or wai cause aprill looking good
1617043481,April is historically a good month for BTC
1617043530,"but be careful. We did spike pretty high, pretty fast today. I wouldnt take any large leverage positions at this moment if you plan on future trading"
1617043539,There is likely going to be a correction
1617043540,Ye seen that
1617043558,dont use leverage if you are new to crypto
1617043566,still within its outer trendline for me
1617043569,looks ok
1617043572,Binance takes 3 days to put my money in anyways so
1617043587,buy from somewhere else and send to binance
1617043596,I can buy on crypto.com instantly
1617043596,I'm addicted to leverage now sigh
1617043621,2.5% fee but fee free for the first 30 days
1617043636,and I think its 10k per week limit on card transactions
1617043659,Binance takes some hours if you do a sepa transfer on a weekday tbh
1617043663,What I normally do is buy USDC and then send it over and convert it to USDT
1617043671,and 0 fees on it
1617043689,I unfortunately cant buy from binance because American
1617043690,😭
1617043700,It just takes to up to 2 days to get from my bank to binance
1617043702,gotta buy somewhere else then send to binance
1617043713,It's k I'll wait didn't had the rush b4 and won't do it
1617043714,Where do you live?
1617043719,Germany
1617043723,ya because you are probably doing a ACH/Wire transfer
1617043736,those normally take 1-2 business days
1617043737,Oh I’m not sure but maybe you can do instant bank transfer
1617043746,"strange, I'm from Belgium and it was like 6 hours last time"
1617043749,I think. Binance told me not to do that
1617043758,Mine took a hour ish from U.K.
1617043762,I mean again there was no rush b4 so why rush it now eh
1617043773,I'll just keep an eye on everything and spend it in 2 days or not
1617043783,"Nah, SEPA Instant Transfer to Binance was instant. From German bank account."
1617043802,It just depends on the market condition. Sometimes there is a rush as the market is quick and you sometimes miss your buy in spot
1617043805,but im also greedy
1617043811,so I get mad when I miss my buy in
1617043813,every day new opportunities
1617043817,thats what I learned
1617043821,dont rush it
1617043823,Will do the instant thing next time then
1617043833,Exactly!
1617043844,"For sure. Don't FOMO but when you have a plan, getting held back by your bank is a bad feeling"
1617043882,I bought btc at 52500 on thursday and its was at 55000ish on friday and now its 58000
1617043898,there are times when its helpful to be at least quick enough to get in within the hour
1617043919,Still waiting for my coinbase pro btc to be able to be withdrawn
1617043920,If your bank supports it
1617043922,Another great little pump from SKY

1617044028,I like how daz and knight blamed the btc crash for enj dropping but now. Its so slow even with the entire market going really green
1617044035,BUT HEY IM ALMOST GREEN
1617044045,going to an ATH again is not easy
1617044048,just ask CHR
1617044055,But xbox is enj
1617044061,And apparently visa is enj
1617044063,the myans predict that it will drop to 1$ right before you are green @That one belgian super cunt
1617044063,everything is ENJ
1617044065,Pretty sure it does for 1%
1617044068,its the backbone off Crypto
1617044084,MS Azure is build on ENJ
1617044094,its just not known
1617044099,Im pretty sure my nonexistant child is built off ENJ
1617044101,(not true dont believe me)
1617044107,my house is built from ENJ
1617044108,70% of Fortune 300 are powered by ENJ 😉

1617044116,Hell even @SeineJanie is ENJ powered
1617044128,I hear ENJelic voices...
1617044145,ENJ was a beast tho

1617044373,"Like I’m sure ENJ has got potential, I don’t doubt it. But my god a conversation about anything other than that would be nice"
1617044393,It’s like going to therapy that’s being held by your own rapist
1617044481,Tbh buying cro is probably a good long term hodl
1617045170,Y’all heard about this GTO token? Seems legit.
1617045303,"I feel this tbh. I hold it because I do think it’ll move up, but I’m so tired of hearing about it."
1617045384,I’m all for getting behind a coin if you believe in it but please don’t refer to it as “she” like it’s a real person lmao these guys
1617045396,Actually simping for ENJ
1617045994,"Ah, I thought he was the one that charges. That is only half as bad."
1617046020,Oh lmao could you imagine

1617046188,"This is random, trying to find a good exchange and wallet as well, any recommendations"
1617046259,No!! 🤦🏼‍♂️
1617046280,lmao I’m just foolin
1617046288,I’m like Kayne except not an asshole
1617046302,why is MTL so high up?
1617046321,@SeineJanie you’re still long on LUKSO right
1617046325,"It's alright. I just thought since you're  not a Sophomore, you maybe didn't read the warning about GTO in #🎓post-grads-podium"
1617046331,The name change has me shook
1617046353,An announcement was made today concerning it
1617046357,Yup. Loooong long. Waiting for mainnet launch in the latter half of the year and LYXe -> LYX conversion.
1617046385,It’s crazy how much it swings. A +- 10% day seems normal.
1617046386,which one? Why didnt anybody say that to me
1617046403,DYOR if you want to know so bad
1617046422,People in here don’t have to spoon feed you information
1617046449,some has
1617046459,Oops lmao
1617046466,Is that MetalPay?
1617046481,Yeah
1617046486,No one HAS to. some people can give you info but its on you to find your own info and check the info you are given
1617046506,i can't find the info about it
1617046516,Then you probably shouldnt go into it
1617046516,There’s a tweet they sent out earlier
1617046524,Like the first thing if you Google metalpay
1617046536,"If you can't do your own research on a event, you probably shouldnt participate in it"
1617046537,Took me like thirty seconds on Twitter dude
1617046540,that is how you get fucked
1617046544,This shit ain’t hard lmao
1617046587,>coin moons >check Twitter
1617046606,pump that mtl
1617046624,Unless it’s a scheduled pump or some shit just search the coin name goddamn
1617046630,You gotta check every source and assume that every single person in this server is full of shit. I have debunked countless articles in here that people just assume are true. You NEED to do your own research. If you are unable to do your own research you are better off not participating
1617046655,did u participate in the mtl?
1617046658,"Not saying this to be mean. Im saying this because if you don't, you WILL fuck yourself"
1617046678,imagine fucking yourself
1617046684,I tried. My VPN wasn't working. Probably has something to do with being at work
1617046703,I did my own research on it first
1617046708,figured out why it was pumping
1617046709,what type of info is most likely to make the coin go up?
1617046716,assessed the risk
1617046730,put in a  minimal amount of money because it was a bet
1617046801,Did their license in washington cause this?
1617046812,took me 4 clicks to find out what you needed to find
1617046831,They have 3 different announcements on their twitter today
1617046847,damn
1617046865,So u go and literally analyse every coin?
1617046883,I analyse the coins I am about to get into yes
1617046896,"I dont analyse every coin. If someone talks about a coin, I do my own research"
1617046911,doing your own research isnt having a complete understanding about EVERYTHING in the market
1617046922,its having an understanding of everything YOU touch in the market
1617046926,Okay.

1617049364,"`AUDIO: 3.30008 $ is 10.69% below peak of 3.695 $, -5.37% from entry 3.48751 $`"
1617049382,"yeah, it's even below the buy zone 😄"
1617049394,Also I made a quick 10% from MTL then it went down and lost...
1617049395,I haven't done any analysis on my own though
1617049398,Just trusting the signal bot
1617049490,so i don't need to do stop limits?
1617049663,Nobody said that 😆
1617049679,Ok already down 5$ from it. let's hope that it will do good

1617058429,Been in ALGO since .32
1617059271,💰💰
1617060005,Lol
1617060012,That must have felt like forever
1617060213,Thoughts on audio?
1617060214,Rn
1617060453,It’s in #🍻signal-bar so definitely something
1617060726,"Hi @Alanox, what is #signal bar?"
1617060744,I can't see that anywhere in the menu
1617060763,And if I click your link text it doesn't do anything
1617060775,This. Tells you when to buy and sell a specific coin.
1617060782,You need Sophomore or above to access it
1617060797,Ah okay
1617060980,So is sophomore the level I will reach if I have 5 invites?
1617061499,can you send this HQ? or original tweet
1617061507,what is this intended to mean
1617061565,"I have a question for people here: so I bought a bunch of Aave (AAV) at 391 USDT and I've been waiting for the price to go back up because obviously I don't want to sell at a loss, but the price is down around 360 and this is capital that I could invest on another asset that is actually going up in price.  So my question is, should I always just wait and sell an asset above the buy in price, or is it ever a better call to sell lower but in order to buy something else that's climbing?"
1617061689,just wait for it to go up again lmao
1617061695,but its up to you
1617061698,your strat
1617061700,your money
1617061767,But do you think AAV will go back up again to ath and beyond?
1617061800,And I guess I'm asking about a general trading dilemma that I have:
1617061812,We expecting any movement for ADA come full decentralisation ?
1617061816,you just need to go back to 391 at least
1617061830,will btc go higher again? the same kind of question
1617061836,will never happen
1617061846,100% is impossible
1617061848,i think
1617061875,Ada is making great moves
1617061889,Not to be ignored
1617061902,sure it is
1617061954,"If I have all my cash locked up in assets, and I want to buy something promising, a new asset that is climbing, how do I figure out which asset to sell?  I don't want to sell an underperforming asset like @Blackhartd mentions because I don't want to sell below my buy in price, but I also don't want to sell an asset that is performing well because the rocket ship could keep going higher.  Any thoughts?"
1617061998,i think that is up to you to know
1617062048,Do research and risk
1617062415,man

1617080889,No cap.. and congrats on the pond pump. only the start :-)
1617083701,EVERYONE ON THIS GROUP PLEASE READ AND TAKE MY ADVICE.  Do not i repeat do not fall for the pumps on this or any other group. I have made the mistake in believing the pumps are for all but they use us as for the prepump when the price of the chosen crypto is going down. I have had a total of $27k wich now is 15k a loss of 12k. As soon as they let everyone know about the pump it has already pumped massively and when they reveal the pump is only too try too prepump its drop back down. Dont be a stupid dkhead like me. I was luky enough too gain most my money back risking it all as MTL was gaining but please dont be as stupid as i was thinking these pumps are anything but scams.
1617083828,mate

1617100007,Paypall adds ability to convert crypto to fiat
1617100079,I swapped it for ONE  this morning as its on deep 0.19 from 0.22
1617100131,probably high ass fees
1617100163,"The company will charge no transaction fee to checkout with crypto and only one type of coin can be used for each purchase, it said."
1617100200,They will basically allow paying with crypto
1617100229,I haven't read the entire article cause I'm working atm
1617100252,Can you send it?
1617100274,"In dm, i will send it here @GrandGamer"
1617100325,https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currency-paypal/exclusive-paypal-launches-crypto-checkout-service-idUSL1N2LR0OD
1617100333,I would like to ask something about the sale
1617100390,Whats up?
1617100821,Can we talk in dm to not to keep the chat busy?
1617100846,Sure
1617100881,But I think others might also have same kinda questions
1617100920,Guys what happened to audio? Where Will go down?
1617100991,what down? I NEED it UP UP UP!!!
1617101093,Did anyone just get a Binance pop-up for an update?
1617101116,Limited update release 1.38.2
1617101125,Should I okay it or skip it?
1617101154,"ok then, when I click to the offering page firstly it demand us to send BUSD, there is no discount info or a place to write the Giga Chad discount code. So will these appear in the steps after sending the money?"
1617101183,Yes. After they got the money they ask for affiliates
1617101256,Yes but AUDIO Is going to hell not up... Have no volume Is crypto dead
1617101355,lol are binance and kucoin updating at the same time?!?!?
1617101360,hmmmm
1617101372,that asian that made binance probably made kucoin too
1617101378,aint no way they update at the same time
1617101384,their apps are almost identical
1617101387,fuck audio then.. lol... going to add  One.. i am sure it will go up to 0.22 and more.. to cover Audio small loss as I got it yesterday on deep anwyays.
1617101389,although the kucoin one is slightly better
1617101391,exactly
1617101426,"i mean, its updated price would be its last traded (or mark) price right?"
1617101445,no reason they couldnt trade at the same time when its all based on what the traders are doing
1617101540,I don't understand what you guys are talking about.  Is there a new ICO that I'm not aware of?
1617101552,audio is a coin
1617101583,a coin thats not doin so hot rn
1617101593,down 13% and counting
1617101604,and anything that goes down

1617105255,good otherwise i woulda actually yelled at u
1617105264,it will certainly go somewhere
1617105276,i personally believe in it 100%
1617105278,just like nano
1617105279,bro even if i put my money on random crypto into binance
1617105282,x2
1617105294,even still
1617105297,that shit is staked
1617105302,ur makin money off ur money
1617105311,and its not worth less than it was
1617105313,thats a win
1617105319,135$ monthly
1617105330,"i bought dent at 0,045"
1617105340,"sold it at 0,090"
1617105345,when u do some shit like that
1617105358,u dont care about staking for 135$
1617105397,are you withdrawing the extra and selling it?
1617105415,no
1617105457,good. you could have absolutely made more money in the same time on other things. you could have also lost that money on other things. ur getting basically a whole ass egld a month
1617105468,i would not write that off as nothing
1617105472,even if it doesnt seem like much
1617105501,at the end of hypergrowth if egld still 145 $ i sell everything
1617105562,thats fair
1617105624,either way
1617105627,it leaves this wedge soon
1617105636,within a few days
1617105649,yeah i wait for nft into maiar
1617105660,id say if it dips below 110 anytime soon
1617105664,might have a problem
1617105676,it cant dips below 110 i think
1617105681,57% egld staked
1617105695,"if it does, its means my TA is completely wrong and the coin is probs fucked"
1617105714,if it does i put 9k into eth long x10
1617105723,why audio?
1617105742,i dont wanna invest in eth coz it fuckin suuuuucls
1617105745,but its smart
1617105749,and will probs workl
1617105762,ahah will wait for a huge dip
1617105796,"otherwise, if my ta is right (i i sure ass hope it is), id expect egld to ath after this breakout from the wedge"
1617105816,yeah but when it looks for u?
1617105850,hm?
1617105863,breakout
1617105885,sometime next week
1617105911,"i usually dont work with 1D candles for wedges as much coz i daytrade so much, so i dont know exactly when itl burst"
1617105915,id guess the 4th
1617105924,"if u right i will send u 0,1 egld"
1617105935,The hype towards eip1559 will do something with the price for sure
1617105957,anyway i want to short CAT
1617105961,there a fucking mouse in my room
1617105964,and this fucker on my lap
1617105968,and she aint doing anything
1617105971,go on cat
1617105976,kill the mouse
1617106018,"anyway, if maiar is anything as good as i expect it to be"
1617106025,2030
1617106030,egld in the thousands
1617106038,what we talking about
1617106048,if theres money as prize i want to enter 👀
1617106048,egld breakout
1617106059,^^
1617106063,soon tm
1617106084,1D candles
1617106084,hm
1617106096,https://tenor.com/view/horatio-caine-yeah-csi-miami-sunglasses-meme-gif-4566497
1617106099,lemme do research
1617106113,"It's been 1 month that I see graphics like that and nothing happens, I do not criticize your work"
1617106127,i could very much be wrong
1617106148,i havent studied wedges with candles at 1D before
1617106160,so it could do something entirely unexpected for me
1617106181,"we have a extreme wick on 15 feb, was it the day kraken (or sum exchange) needed liquidity and sold things like ETH or ADA really cheap, and also egld it seems?"
1617106210,my long buy in point is roughly 130
1617106211,yep
1617106272,"if i had to guess, provided the breakout will happen, the absolute low it gets to within that wedge is 125"
1617106352,i say we *could* have a breakout on 1st april around afternoon here in europe
1617106356,lemme check more things
1617106370,can i draw freehand on binance
1617106380,volume isnt changing tho
1617106402,imo 9 april ath
1617106414,cuz nft 9 april
1617106440,oh
1617106443,some serious shit
1617106448,im seeing
1617106453,egld is really great
1617106459,but i want some fking money
1617106470,Come on CHR you fucking beauty
1617106485,want to talk like him
1617106508,this is my guess
1617106579,"@Dani_tzt i say possible breakouts if we take the lines information, expected around 8, 12 or 19 april, but check MACD and ichimoku clouds"
1617106586,macd is higher than before
1617106590,after ATH
1617106605,and the ichimoku cloud leaves current price above itself
1617106621,so if we keep above it a breakout should come no matter what sooner or later
1617106659,"we will see if u win 0,1 egld lol"
1617106662,"yesterday MACD was double previous green day, early march, and today ones is keeping triple it"
1617106674,hope you earn more than that lol
1617106676,i just hope
1617106684,it doenst happen while im sleeping
1617106689,and i miss my long buy in
1617106691,bro i have 90 egld stuck into staking lol
1617106708,ok honestly no cap
1617106712,if you gave me 200k

1617106728,i would pick egld
1617106738,20 apr

1617106743,no jokes

1617106759,"nano doesnt give staking rewards, but otherwise, yea, thatd be my next point"

1617108343,Or you can be like me. And go -1200% because you were too greedy to get out at 800% :kekw:
1617108413,oh s ht
1617108572,What's the difference between margin and options and futures?
1617108603,I closed on CHR
1617108610,And can someone walk me through a basic leveraged trade on binance?
1617108610,+261%
1617108613,I’m done
1617108617,"I had a good 900 bucks profit on enj. Got greedy and influenced by dazz..

Then it crashed and i hodled and now im at -200% stable.

ADA is currently 400 bucks profit and i am doubting if i should take profit or hodl for 2 bucks."
1617108639,I want to use a small amount like 100 USDT worth to make sure the risk is minimal
1617108641,2 bucks would be a cool 3500 dollars profit
1617108674,hmmm take it off
1617108709,"Any one on mtl? Not seen a single thing mentioned about it, then load up today and it's soaring"
1617108744,Margin is a literal loan. You borrow coins. You repay them back the coins. If the coins are worth more in usdt than before you can keep the profit. AFAIK you cant get liquidated just have more to pay off. Futures is a gamble on well the future. You can lose everything since you dont have the coins just a piece of paper essentially
1617108781,and an options is a contract with the OPTION to buy or sell the security at a predetermined price
1617108787,Thing is i know ada will hit 2 dollars. So do i exit now and pray for a super crash for a beter entry or just. Wait
1617108801,"Yup, you can repay your debt on margin and then have no liquidation price anymore and the remaining coins are yours. Did this with DENT, margin-bought 250k DENT and sold 50k DENT yesterday to pay back USDT debt. Now I have 200k free DENT 👌🏼"
1617108802,yeah ada will go for 2 dollars
1617108807,but wait for a dip
1617108817,With perpetual futures you are always borrowing. Basically
1617108819,Im already in tho
1617108821,What do people think about audio considering it’s way below the signal bar buy in?
1617108824,1.13
1617108870,I just gambled 100$ on it 😂 at 3.16
1617108875,but u know that adda at 2$ mean 70billions marketcap ?
1617108879,its a lot
1617108958,Good question. I think it's bottoming out. But I already said that yesterday at 3.25 😄
1617108973,still in it and waiting the 15 days unless it drops a **lot** more
1617109165,Im in the US and i cant verify identity
1617109171,"I am in BUSD, I am looking for a coin. Do you think if it drops more?"
1617109187,What exchange should i use to buy with a debit card?
1617109225,Buy OGN
1617109228,It should go up from here. No guarantees tho
1617109245,Gg
1617109258,It’s still fucking going lmao I knew this would happen
1617109275,"-2,7 for me"
1617109277,If it hits 0.5 I will cry
1617109278,Why tho
1617109288,Its pumping alot
1617109292,Biz is shilling it
1617109322,haha I left CHR today too lol

1617109345,4chans biz
1617109376,"I sold below 0,42 yesterday lol"
1617109380,Oh well
1617109391,High leverage can’t stay in too long
1617109399,anyone wanna watch me play nier automata on very hard?
1617109414,talk to me about crypto lmao
1617109474,the fuck mtl is 300%
1617109779,WTF
1617109784,this is big brain energy
1617109788,whaaaaat
1617109822,"No more debt, no more liq 😉"
1617109837,Plus 15 usdt profit already
1617109844,wtf is going on with MTL?
1617109848,thats crazy
1617109972,so are perpetual futures guaranteed to make money as long as it goes up sometime with your strategy?
1617110050,Re: MTL... earned a money transmitter license in Washington state.  Went parabolic... time machine pls
1617110141,Chr didn’t stop at .42
1617110148,Is it a miracle
1617110153,Am I dreaming
1617110344,its cause hollow left
1617110667,Fuck u
1617110675,But yeah it is lmao
1617110762,"If it drops back below .41 I’ll take a look, if it keeps going I can’t complain I started CHR with £100 and it’s now £1800"
1617111016,futures?
1617111122,WTF
1617111124,HOOOOW
1617111128,WTF
1617111166,"Because for the first week or I would take profit at like .41, open a new position at .38"
1617111174,It’s only this last weekend I’ve been in and left it
1617111286,Yeh. 30X
1617111693,needa do copy pasta of ur stratgey
1617111699,to get back my 150$
1617112913,Huh?
1617112948,"Margin and perpetual futures will give you amplified losses and gains, according to your leverage."
1617113231,I feel like Ada sleeping for the past few days
1617113246,ada is the sleepiest coin 🐒
1617113257,Doesn’t follow anything haha
1617113264,I'm not impressed by the Kucoin bot so far. Looks just like the bad trades I can do manually.

1617115391,You cant judge it from just 5 hours of it running...
1617115428,"VRA was down 20% for me, yet it was at break even point"
1617115437,inb4 BTC crashes to 50K because ANY news of crypto being turned mainstream seems to crash the market
1617115461,"Now it's risen above buy in price, I'm $100 up on 400. No way i would have made that much just holding.... But I suppose it's not for everyone....dyor"
1617115465,Short bitcoin?
1617115475,:kekw:  typical
1617115497,"oof, I wouldn't"
1617115539,No
1617115560,"there were strong speculations about selling the news whenever visa announced their stuff, never happened, it stayed at 58k, now with paypal, I mean it could happen, but hardly. there's so much bullish stuff going on rn"
1617115566,"we confirmed a bull flag, definitely dont short"
1617115589,:kekw:
1617115599,I was tempted to long it this morning
1617115615,Already did a x50 long on bnb
1617115631,50x
1617115637,hope u have enough in your margin
1617115651,quite a few shitcoins I'm following bleeding right now even though btc is doing extremely well. I think people are getting ready
1617115660,Short play is so dumb
1617115685,I see CAKE growing to 10b market cap in a few months
1617115700,maybe even overtaking uni by the end of this year
1617115769,I am gonna open a XRP long soon
1617115794,
1617116336,In about 1 hour there should be another coinbase pump 👀
1617116356,on what
1617116385,On whatever 1-3 coins they are going to list
1617116420,I wouldn't be surprised if nano ends up being one of them
1617116461,😩 not yet i need to buy MOAR
1617116610,Have they announced what coins they are listing
1617116631,"No, they normally do that one hour from now"
1617116640,Plus/minus a few minutes
1617116673,if its nano I am instant swapping all my bnb to nano for the pre listing pump
1617116698,Bout to go turn on coinbase twitter notifications
1617116821,Where are they announcing it?
1617116840,Coinbase pro Twitter
1617116859,Awesome ty
1617117059,nano needs to get more love
1617117084,it is arguably one of the better coins for money transfer and it just gets ignored probably because it doesnt have 80% staking
1617117316,"I rebuilt my pump bot to catch these Coinbase pumps with 50x leverage, let's see if this plays out 🙂"
1617117364,Do you have it detect the prepump which they sometimes have?
1617117390,"Nope, I just enter a position if the price increase is more than 2.5% in 10 seconds"
1617117431,These Coinbase pumps go up slower than a typical BPS /WSB pump so there should be enough time to enter and make good profits
1617117458,If I can catch a +20% with 50x leverage that's 1000% profits 👀
1617117459,"Even without a bot, but ofc not as much as with one. 😃"
1617117484,Feeling a bit jealous right now
1617117492,what % do the coinbase pumps usually reach?
1617117505,"Still need to test things out though haha, could be risky still"
1617117514,20-40% ussually
1617117524,IF the coin has a futures pairing
1617117530,if its STMX I will shit bricks
1617117530,around 20-50% in the first minute if I recall correctly
1617117532,"when you enter a futures trade, how do you get out? gonna try my 1st only with a few bucks - but wanna know the ins and outs"
1617117533,You guys could also use #🟧senior-alerts if I understand @Sjoerd de Jong his concept correctly
1617117549,Wouldn't that be too late?
1617117554,Correct me if i am wrong
1617117570,Pre pump bot detects withing 10 seconds
1617117584,that thing is so full of alerts its hard to filter the noise
1617117587,The price goes to the top in roughly 20 seconds
1617117615,"I have RSR, ONE, ENJ and CHZ opened and ready, hope it's one of these, can't think of any other"
1617117623,"if you guys can, let me know"
1617117646,if its ENJ
1617117648,stonks
1617117665,"There are currently 65 coins that are on Binance Futures but not on Coinbase Pro, so I'm using those"
1617117680,goddamn 66
1617117682,faaack
1617117683,lol
1617117694,I will fucking shit myself with joy
1617117734,*ENJoy
1617117743,Stmx maybe
1617117761,They announced good things already this month
1617117772,Not evidence based^^^^^
1617117809,it could be ENJ
1617117811,Within 1 second
1617117813,its big enough
1617117827,"I also tried digging through their website/API-endpoints to see if their was a trace of any coins before the announcement, but no luck yet"
1617117834,added this one too ty
1617117869,its risky opening a futures on any of these because coins who didn't get picked might doomp
1617117875,Dont buy in based on what i said here!! Not evidence based at all
1617117886,but you know what
1617117893,I got in at STMX at 20 satoshi so I am still
1617117894,very
1617117894,very
1617117895,happy
1617117896,nah I just got the tabs and market orders ready to be pushed
1617117899,that's what I meant

1617117928,TIME TO OPEN X 50S ON ALL OF THEM WITH 10 BUCKS
1617117932,looool
1617117946,"i keep on thinking ""i need to buy ocean"""
1617117948,but I never do
1617117979,I mean I got like 400 bucks on coinlist
1617117983,I am laughing so hard when it will be audio😂
1617117984,which has ocean so I could just buy ocean
1617118005,but I guess ocean is a bad entry point now with all the green
1617118023,opened a chr tab too
1617118029,although idk
1617118042,usually the market caps for the coins on coinbase are larger than average right?
1617118062,I hope it’s sky
1617118065,Just for the lulz
1617118113,coinbase listings tend to have prepump activity as coinbase buys a supply
1617118151,even after the announcement they can do quite well
1617118160,See things like storj and ankr
1617118160,imagine doge
1617118164,:kekw:
1617118175,That would be the day
1617118177,😂
1617118197,Oh shit 125X doge
1617118208,"just looking at ANKR's chart and when coinbase announced its listing, jesus fuck the gains"
1617118313,"Scalping Coinbase Pro on Twitter, and then just auto-buy the mentioned coins also seems promising"
1617118349,These Coinbase pumps are quite new so not many people taking advantage of this right now...
1617118353,Sjoerd hoeveel ekkies voor je bot :kekw:
1617118388,"Guys, can someone immediately report which coins it is as soon as Coinbase makes the announcement?"
1617118398,Turn notifs on
1617118400,For the acc
1617118402,"And okay so when I see which coins, should I buy them spot?"
1617118406,https://twitter.com/CoinbasePro
1617118408,Or use margin?
1617118412,"you guys sure there will be new listings announced today? they've been listing a lot recently, I thought they take breaks in between?"
1617118413,Or futures?
1617118414,"how do you stop / get out of futures, im in the green but sayd no position open, yet the balance in the wallet is going up"
1617118440,Launch in 30 min?
1617118445,Or announcement?
1617118460,Still can be very risky so I would advise to just use spot with a low entry to see what happens
1617118468,yea i would do spot
1617118472,Yeah seems like it
1617118475,still getting 100% in spot
1617118478,when it does pump
1617118482,
1617118546,keep a creepy eye on ada
1617118562,we might get a surprise Africa deal anytime
1617118584,Yah Hoskinson already said they were in talks with Ethiopia
1617118599,But what I still find weird
1617118610,Is that you are connecting experimental/new technology
1617118616,"Nobody knows, so very risky to start guessing at this point"
1617118618,To a relatively laggard country
1617118661,that's how innovation happens though
1617118680,"Truth, I’m curious how they’ll handle population-wide adoption"
1617118686,Or atleast digital infrastructure
1617118723,"As I have been to multiple countries like Tunisia, South-Africa etc. and a technology like crypto has some interesting hurdles"
1617118734,"Coinbase is planning to get all major coins on it's platform, so they will launch new coins regularly"
1617118746,lately they announced 1-3 new coins every Tuesday around 5pm London time
1617118762,(which apparently now is different from Greenwich time)
1617118778,With daylight savings time it could be an hour later though
1617118798,Its 16:39 there
1617118808,4:40
1617118816,thanks for the info guys!
1617118860,So can we still expect at 5 or now six
1617118889,"afaik they are doing the announcement 9am Pacific time, so it should still be 5pm London time"
1617118923,What would that be GMT+1?  If you factor in daylight savings
1617118926,Or at 17:00 UTC which is 6pm London. But probably in 15mins
1617118936,5pm GMT+1
1617118948,"4pm UTC, 5pm London time"
1617118963,I hate BST
1617118967,6pm in normal Europe :kekw:
1617119077,the deal is already done. the prime minister just needs to sign but everybody else has agreed to it.
1617119082,"What should I sell a bit of to buy the coins for this pump?  Holding ETH, BNB, CHR, VET, 1inch, AAV, ATOM, and BTC"
1617119089,dont
1617119094,we don't know wtf is going to happen
1617119114,Then why is my ada x100 futures not worth 1 million yet /sarcasm
1617119114,though BNB is probably the safest bet
1617119123,there is no X100
1617119126,lies
1617119140,true
1617119149,it's mostly the regulators holding it back
1617119157,that's slowly breaking down tho
1617119158,That’s why I said sarcasm :kekw:
1617119161,Max is x75
1617119178,I just want 2 bucks so I can get my 3.5K
1617119185,enj to 3 bucks so I can get 2K
1617119194,so i can exit this week  with nearly 5K of profit
1617119204,which I then put into X5 XRP
1617119205,ada's been my most profitable futures trade
1617119207,:kekw:
1617119211,it's boring and predictable
1617119216,just how i like it
1617119218,But OK so can I just buy spot on binance for the coin being pumped?
1617119231,should I switch ada from spot to futures?
1617119245,do it you filthy degenerate
1617119283,Why btc no moon
1617119312,Nothing hits nicer than holding a lot in a coin then coinbase announces a listing
1617119317,😍
1617119338,mmmmm
1617119343,I bet
1617119348,i do 😏
1617119396,😂
1617119414,waking up to that cb pro announcement then u immediately make 200%
1617119415,Which coins are they going to announce?
1617119415,🤤
1617119425,We don’t know
1617119447,"if you snooze, you lose. Unless you had a tp at just the right spot."
1617119450,It's basically a pnd where Coinbase = Dominus
1617119458,tp?
1617119460,i never set tp
1617119471,doesnt allow me to type 'moon' in
1617119474,😞
1617119484,then you wake up to learning that your coin was worth twice as much 5 minutes ago
1617119507,Or that your 800 profit because -1200
1617119511,Imstillsalty
1617119540,How is ENJ looking for you?
1617119569,I forgot about since we now hardly hear about it
1617119576,I called sky
1617119579,And look at it go
1617119581,let's keep it that way

1617119588,https://tenor.com/view/triggered-triggering-intensifies-rage-gif-15297552
1617119608,it might actually be that
1617119614,maybe that was the golden egg :kekw:
1617119625,crypto.com is giving out enj as staking rewards right now
1617119649,"65 coins, 100 dollar each, leveraged to 2k"
1617119657,6 min to go
1617119674,"On my mobile phone, won’t happen I guess 😦"
1617119680,
1617119714,Le sigh
1617119719,how much has binance taken from you on funding fees?
1617119723,enj has a pretty high %
1617119727,I dont want to know
1617119733,yikes
1617119739,want a hug bro?
1617119755,*nudge*
1617119769,🥵
1617119788,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/byycXRXg/ for comparison, last week's coinbase pump"
1617119812,which timeframe is the announcement?
1617119815,the start of the chart?
1617119818,CRV (orange line) is probably the most tuypical one
1617119823,should be within the next 8 minutes
1617119826,So can I buy whichever coins they list directly with BNB?
1617119827,ah
1617119838,"no, the spike where all 3 go up simultaneously"

1617121002,i have spend so much fucking time and energy on ENJ I am exiting with profit
1617121059,"thanks for pumping DENT btw, I already made 10$ on that 😄"
1617121078,Does anyone know why the long quantity is lower than the short quantity and how I can avoid/calculate this? My bot doesn't like it haha (40x leverage)
1617121082,only 69 more times and I'll have my balance where it was before ENJ happened

1617121287,My promise still stands. If enj goes 80 dollars im tattooing enj on me :kekw:
1617121344,"Also he is still doing the ""its delayed"" excuse for his stupid canadian made coin"
1617121353,And ofcourse the ceo's name is slavic
1617121377,Because like how eth is a shitcoin with a slavic name enj is a shitcoin with a slavic named ceo
1617121388,If I were you I'd tattoo it on my ass so I don't have to see it all the time
1617121397,I am so glad I don’t have to see that

1617121411,enj is 80 bucks
1617121416,my long never exited
1617121417,He’s a nice person but the ENJ shilling was unbearable
1617121431,yes 200 bucks worth of aga
1617121443,you're really going for the slavic CEOs 😄
1617121564,oh god
1617121568,I lost my 200 bucks
1617121663,:-(
1617121701,:kekw:

1617122068,wanted to buy the dip
1617122071,never got it
1617122074,😪
1617122129,Rule number 1 of crypto always hold!!!
1617122142,"Reef is launching its testnet tomorrow along with 7 other major announcements and updates. 
Im pretty sure its almost finished consolidating from the last push. 
Check out the telegram, roadmap, and charts to see for yourself."
1617122245,45 minute chart ML - B strategy.  if you just buy when the yellow Vwap on ML B crosses the zero line bullish and sell when it crosses bearish you would have made some good profits.   Of course every move is not big but you would have caught 3 of these big moves with ease.  Use the integrated VWAP on ML-A to set your stoploss behind.  if you look deeper you can see divergence on the blue waves and the MACD getting weak bullish before these trades.   easy scalps all day long
1617122434,How so? 🧐
1617122592,Ceo has a slavic name apparently thus my history says. Slavic names is curser
1617122601,Eth is vitalik. Enj is slavic name. Now aga
1617122604,:dababy:

1617126889,BNB has more profits then her and my BNB has less capital in it and was started WAY later than my LUNA. No excuses LUNA. Get to 100$ right now!
1617127050,"isolated or cross, which is better?"
1617127081,Cross if you got the cash to capture margin no matter what
1617127086,Depends
1617127089,I do cross
1617127110,Because I let my margin go lower then -100%
1617127130,But it can backfire easily
1617127131,:kekw: oooh lower than -100 ooooh

1617127779,I got a feeling
1617127799,The paypal thing is gonna be bad
1617127819,what happened?
1617127857,Paypal doesnt keep the crypto and just exchanges it during transfer. In other words every single paypal transaction will be a sell on some market and this could literally means a strong selling force. Constantly
1617127925,Tesla doesnt actually hurt btc because elon is gonna hodl but no fucking way paypal is hodling
1617127934,"The amount of circulating bitcoin is getting smaller and smaller as big brands come in like Tesla, Paypal, and im sure tons of hedgies. I just don't see the consumer market selling on paypal affecting that much"
1617127980,We shall see and that part is all speculation because of course we cant get real numbers on how much institutional investors own but IMO I don't thinks its going to affect much
1617128044,"Im personally holding my long based off the numbers and statistics. April is historically a good month for bitcoin and a large amount of contracts are aiming for the 80,000$ mark"

1617128128,march yes but cause of covid
1617128133,not like a yearly cycle
1617128138,Yes and march is over after tomorrow but april has been percentage wise a good month every single year except for one
1617128142,let me see if I can find the chart
1617128157,im pretty sure it was almost back at 9k by april last year
1617128211,7.5k by april 1st
1617128232,"9,2 by april 31st"
1617128241,"In ADA, CHZ and AUDIO. Hope it will make at least 25% profit in the coming weeks"

1617128377,It'll boom in april
1617128396,I think that it's going to go up or down
1617128396,But abe you got a wife n kids you shouldn't be in crypto
1617128401,with 80k as the target for expirations i can see a nice increase

1617128743,April is the most consistent month of gains with only 1 loss month
1617128749,Yep
1617128756,while march is one of the most consistent months for losses
1617128759,8/10 aprils were bullish for btc
1617128782,and only 1/10 were bearish
1617128795,Yeah
1617128795,well its the end of Q1 aswell so that makes a nice month end push
1617128822,q2 end seems like a 40/60
1617128844,but q3 end looks good
1617128847,I'm feeling a sexy 25x after we break our previous ath
1617128875,"Also if you want beautiful monthly percentages, here is my source: https://bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com/"
1617128904,scroll down for stats
1617128910,Aight boys i need some advice for futures today. I tried rune yesterday and got a solid +85%. Yall got eyes on any coins for the week?
1617128920,I'm looking at audio
1617128921,oh i know i was joking
1617128929,Waiting for it to dip to like 2.50
1617128934,To buy in
1617128968,"My current positions for futures are as follows: BNB, ETH, LUNA, BTC, STMX"
1617128984,All green so far!
1617128994,how funny was the ada listing on coin spot pro i read that a mile away after seeing the xrp pump and dump
1617129000,BNB is probably not a good entry right now though
1617129003,it gained ALOT today
1617129005,Did u set your tps at break even?
1617129072,Yeah i missed that motherfucker last night while i was eyeballing rune
1617129089,My TPs are different based off each position but my SLs are aiming for between 50-90% losses because of how bitcoin has been working lately
1617129102,I am willing to tank up to about 90% on some positions
1617129117,but like STMX is only at 50%
1617129140,It just depends on how much I have faith on the coin's future
1617129146,Guys have you seen the TKO launchpas
1617129146,thats how I decide SL
1617129151,What so you thibk about
1617129151,Ah you're playing with the devil
1617129163,I normally match my SL with my TP
1617129166,And he's got an oiled up 8 incher ready to go
1617129184,so if I have a 50% SL I will normally have a 50% TP
1617129185,We're in an uptrend thi
1617129189,U should be fine
1617129203,oh im not overleveraged at alll and can adjust as needed
1617129208,see i'm an intellectual and do max leverage so i be fuckin with the devil
1617129213,all my liqs are super duper low
1617129235,Yeah i see you dump lifesavings into margin
1617129238,Thats good
1617129243,I do the same
1617129257,Nah I utilize cross so I allow it to dump my life savings in margin for me 😉
1617129265,thats why I NEED stop losses
1617129275,Ahhh you're on margin
1617129284,Risky business
1617129290,no not margin
1617129296,cross margin instead of isolated
1617129299,I meant cross
1617129301,Yh yh
1617129312,How long are u holding stmx? @Jeremyfto
1617129314,Its not risky if you stop loss. I basically make my own liq
1617129335,Yeah now i got why u set sl at 50% 90% losses
1617129337,a day or two idk.
1617129349,Just depends on what the market looks like
1617129353,most of my positions I am lose on
1617129356,loose*
1617129452,Honestly its really helpful to me to be honest. It makes sure I dont hold onto a red longer than I have to
1617129461,I used to rely on liq as my stop loss
1617129484,I find I lose less when I connect everything together because I care about each position more
1617129586,Idk I feel like I am good at analyzing things but half the battle is just mentality for me. Just getting myself in a winner mind set so I am not willing to tank big losses and I am constantly taking profit on awesome wins
1617129891,Lol well im up 70% on stmx already so thx dawg
1617130002,👌
1617130178,Any thoughts on Filecoin?

1617131274,How does one get into TKO on Binance ?
1617131286,If I'm holding BNB in the vault does that work?
1617131306,How do we get it?
1617131334,If you look for it on the Binance website it will explain
1617131435,What do u think about tko?
1617131504,@fffffffffffff I did and it doesn't make sense
1617131510,STORJ is almost back in a dip lol

1617131676,Tko is not available tomorrow
1617131688,They will calculate your average bnb holdings over a 7 day period for the sale
1617131692,Hourly check
1617131712,Okay so I've got a bunch of BNB in the vault.  How does that work?
1617131724,How do I sign up for TKO with that?
1617131821,I don’t think people in this group mind helping out but dude for the last 2 or 3 days you’ve sat there asking question after question. Like try a little harder
1617131837,Dude read the announcement
1617131841,I literally posted it above
1617131877,"Yes, I read it and I am on binance launchpad reading through everything.  I just don't understand what I have to do. Do I stake BNB?"
1617131883,I don't quite understand how it works

1617131952,
1617131952,@olack that's an exaggeration but yes I have asked some questions. People are asking questions here all the time.  Is that a problem for you?
1617131975,🤦‍♂️
1617131977,Half your questions are how to sign up for websites so ya kinda
1617131997,*Read*
1617132037,I don’t see you putting much effort into anything you are asking for someone to hold your hand and do it that’s how I take this all
1617132089,my man
1617132095,I don't understand
1617132106,@felixthechat you need bnb in ur spot wallet. and binance will use it for u.
1617132107,U need to have bnb for a long time to participate or what
1617132110,You need your BNB in spot
1617132112,Yeah
1617132114,Wow
1617132118,That took 5 seconds
1617132124,?
1617132129,"I had something really weird happen with my BNB on Binance and nobody seems to know the answer to what happened, and I've checked on the reddit BNB group etc:  I bought 9 BNB a month ago and it automatically went into the vault because I had that auto switch turned on. So far so good.  But I literally didn't do anything whatsoever with it and checked and in the vault it shows that I have 8.8765 BNB.  So what could have happened to my 0.13 BNB?  Did Binance steal it?"
1617132139,"Tokocrypto's vision is to help Indonesians gain a broader knowledge of the industry and to integrate the technology into the society and subsequently, the global economy. Tokocrypto will be the first local Indonesian cryptocurrency project to offer a unique hybrid token model"
1617132154,no i took it
1617132162,Fluctuating market maybe?
1617132166,I’m pretty certain some of you are genuinely not ment for this
1617132168,:kekw:
1617132180,Do you have “use bnb for fees” turned on?
1617132186,one thing to do. :kekw:
1617132193,That might be the case as it pays trading fees in bnb
1617132207,i am literally copying this guy
1617132218,CZ takes little by little
1617132256,@Paragon  thanks. I missed that fine print.  Thanks for pointing it out.  So if I have my BNB in my spot account then I can sign up I guess
1617132264,Yes
1617132270,So unstake it
1617132274,Let it sit for a few days
1617132274,That BNB was probably spent to cover fees for all your trades
1617132275,And have fun
1617132281,
1617132283,@Paragon So it means that Binance will use my BNB automatically?
1617132283,-
1617132286,Yes
1617132292,CZ takes and gives
1617132300,K
1617132301,"Ok good, so i don't have to stay up fucking 2 am"
1617132343,It’s a subscription pool
1617132349,"@Paragon  regarding the disappearing BNB, that makes sense, but when I bought the BNB the transaction fees were already tallied into the 9 BNB that I bought.  But perhaps other trades I've been making have taken out from my BNB?"
1617132358,Based on input with a max tokens of 200000 per users
1617132366,That is what I implied
1617132406,Think BNB will drop to mid 280s? Cuz I entered just now
1617132443,Bnb crashed to euro 180 in february
1617132456,Which was delicious cause I purchased 20
1617132464,And now that is +€80 each
1617132494,"sheesh, well i can't even afford 0.2 bnb.."
1617132509,Earn more money LUL
1617132530,"When you are unstaking BNB from the vault, what's the difference between fast redemption and standard redemption, aside from the time frame? It doesn't explicitly say"
1617132535,I remember looking at bnb when it was like 30£ lmao
1617132550,Ok so if I understood right. All I need to do is to buy BNB and let it in the spot wallet for some days?
1617132555,Fast redemption > instant
1617132567,Standard > still get rewards from that day’s staking
1617132573,Yes
1617132589,And then subscribe at the pre-alloted time
1617132594,It literally says what is the difference btw
1617132608,Which is 7 april 4:00 am-08:00 am utc
1617132624,Sometimes these babbies have to be spoonfed
1617132646,It takes and gives back some other amount depending on tko health?
1617132652,No clue
1617132666,But it tries to allocate tko at 0.1 usd per token to users
1617132767,"It is probably using the BNB to pay for fees, I think if you use BNB the binance fees are half"
1617132842,Binance reduces fees by 25% if you use bnb iirc
1617132857,If you got a referall you can get a max reduction of 45%
1617132878,Yes now that I think about it I set it up to use bnb to get that fee reduction. And I signed up using a referral code from a friend
1617132906,yes this is how it works i think
1617132962,Putting 100 bucks in bnb
1617133197,"So apologies to @olack but I have a question which is quite legit to ask here:  what is the ""convert"" function on Binance exactly?  I mean if you convert BTC to ETH via convert versus selling/buying in spot account.  Why don't people just convert everything instead of trading?  Is there an incentive for one or the other?"
1617133218,Ease of access
1617133225,"Or rather, why don't people always trade instead of using convert"
1617133314,Because for a reasonable amount of people the market function is rather..... complicated
1617133327,So using convert is an easy way to go “haha bitcoin”
1617133430,"Okay so it's a convenience thing, like buying vegetables prechopped in a bag instead of buying the whole vegetables individually.  But in the metaphor I use here, you pay a premium for the convenience. Is it the case with the convert function on Binance?"
1617133466,I mean basically people who know what they're doing wouldn't use the convert function right?
1617133480,Convert iirc is the same as market sell/market buy
1617133489,"Generally, yes"
1617133489,Ahhh okay 👌
1617133498,That makes sense
1617133511,Thanks
1617133564,I think there is a higher fee rate on conversation as well but I may be wrong
1617133575,The cost of ease of access
1617133584,Iirc that’s because market sell and buy
1617133591,Not sure where you live in Europe but I always get annoyed when I'm in Germany that the supermarkets don't have prechopped vegetables as we do in Belgium and NL
1617133599,I live in the netherlands
1617133610,also BNB is going bonkers. Probably shouldnt get in if you don't already have a position but holy hell
1617133613,I do my own cooking so I get fresh vegetables
1617133616,310$ right now
1617133655,Should have longed
1617133663,Im longing but I should have longed more
1617133677,Only longing 400$ at 10x leverage
1617133681,so 4000$ BNB
1617133689,"I cook too and usually try to get veg from markets, but in Albert Heijn it's really convenient sometimes to get a bag of precut fresh veg to quickly throw in a pot when you get home, and not have the hassle of chopping and peeling for ages"
1617133694,CHR doing well
1617133698,im at 211% ROE right now so have already more than tripled my money
1617133737,I dont understand what you mean by doing well
1617133752,Since I bought lol
1617133771,Gotcha. Its negative 24 right now so its not doing super well today
1617133778,24 hour*
1617133800,Its +10% ?
1617133811,Oh shit I read that wrong
1617133813,What
1617133814,I read CHZ
1617133816,Im so dumb
1617133820,ignore me lol
1617133832,Couldn’t reenter CHR yet
1617133836,Meh
1617133839,Was gonna say. Confused the heck outta me
1617133843,"I'm feeling the BNB bump now in my portfolio because I am holding a bunch in spot, but I just wish I had figured out margin trading sooner and had some leverage on it"
1617133855,good time to buy iris
1617133858,Can people please stop making cryptos that have super similar abbreviations lol
1617133858,Is it still a good idea to long BNB with leverage?
1617133886,@Jeremyfto  100% with you on that!!
1617133897,I wouldnt enter right now if I were you
1617133902,There are actually cryptos with the exact same 3 letters
1617133902,its +13% today on the futures chart
1617133906,Btc - btt - btc - btb - bkc - bbb
1617133916,So how the fuck are you supposed to know which you are buying?
1617133921,Futures is higher than actual spot
1617133927,Like for instance
1617133935,eth is flying wow.  i missed signal bar
1617133942,Ya it varies from time to time. Its usually close to the same though
1617133952,Someone on here was shilling HNT
1617133960,but he is asking about leverage so I assume he means futures
1617133962,"When I looked up HNT on Blockfolio,"
1617133966,There are several!
1617133968,most people dont do margin buys
1617133976,Different coins with that same abbreviation
1617133978,when futures are availible
1617133990,You mean the pairs
1617133993,I go into good coins during the dips
1617134002,thats how I decide when to enter
1617134029,You risk it dipping further but if you do proper TA you can usually predict when its about to go back up
1617134049,There are also strategies to finding good entry spots
1617134055,Btc did triple dip :p
1617134056,I shorted-longed bnb for ~100 euro profit today
1617134061,but you normally dont want to buy in at +13%
1617134080,I don’t see any good entries right now either
1617134093,I will wait it out for the day
1617134102,Thats how I was yesterday
1617134109,so little coins to enter after bitcoin boost
1617134109,Missed on ANKR and CHR this morning
1617134133,Thats why its good to have a mix of longer positions and shorter positions
1617134141,and hope your longer positions hit during those spikes
1617134153,Im rephrasing cause that was confusing
1617134162,@Jeremyfto why do people usually do futures over margin buys?
1617134166,Thats why its good to have a mix of Long term positions and short term positions
1617134176,Margin buys is complicated
1617134179,what a great stable coin
1617134181,When I tried it
1617134182,Why they had to name going up long and going down short is beyond me but it complicates things
1617134213,Ya its confusing. I normally stay away from margin buying. If it doesnt have a futures then I usually just buy it straight
1617134218,There are coins that you can only do margin on and not futures
1617134240,I would like to leverage FET but meh no futures
1617134259,Yep. Thats where I sit. What I would give to be able to leverage NANO
1617134279,$REEF is more stable than BUSD
1617134286,Its got such great potential value but no futures
1617134304,I would 10000% super long a 10x nano if I had the option to
1617134323,Mainnet release tomorrow 👀
1617134372,fr so i can finally expect something more than 0.1%???
1617134381,"Yes, 0.2%"
1617134387,"and a terrible entry point if you dont already have reef. I probably should have bought some yesterday but hey, Iv made profits on my positions that I did have so Im not complaining"
1617134388,😎
1617134394,only so much capital

1617134470,Maybe if I can get some military conscription going
1617135045,can someone explain why GTO is a scamcoin?

1617135820,@Paragon
1617135822,🧐
1617135825,
1617135831,it says futures wallet counts
1617135878,Interesting
1617135890,"Also wellp, ID verification is odd for this"
1617135916,Yeah that’s odd. One says spot wallet
1617135930,The other says everything including launchpad/vault
1617135961,uh one thing buds
1617135985,werent some futures contract expiring now on month ending?
1617135993,what could be the outcome of that
1617135997,That was last friday
1617136004,its the last friday of every month
1617136012,yeah cant remember what that does mean
1617136022,why is it friday and all that
1617136038,Because they aren't doing perpetual futures. They are doing contracts
1617136040,Puts and calls
1617136042,On bitcoin
1617136057,that means people have till that day to get the contract to their goal point or they lose money
1617136082,"the people who are shorting have till that day to get it to a lower price, the people who are longing have till that day to get it to a higher price"
1617136102,you can set the price to whatever you want but its a contract between two people so you have to get someone else to accept it
1617136180,There is normally volatility on contract expiration days due to people trying to not lose money
1617136199,"if there are more people longing, there will be more force trying to make it go up, shorting is vice versa"
1617136226,so the amount of contracts isn't the only thing that matters. The divide matters too
1617136253,
1617136267,Its not a for sure thing. Its just a indicator. For example last friday there were more shorts than longs
1617136274,so there should have been more force pushing it downward
1617136278,but it went up
1617136324,"It was 6 billion dollars worth of contracts expiring(which is record numbers) so it was suppose to be very volatile but the divide was only 200,000,000$ difference so it was close to balance"
1617136335,There’s also the thing with
1617136355,The incentive for the parties who stand to lose the most to reduce their losses
1617136383,So if the balance is in favor of shorting (so lower bitcoin) wouldn’t there be more of an incentive to make it go up more
1617136400,This is true. Not all reds are the same shade of red nor is all greens the same shade of green
1617136440,"now we are past that day though which is good. My prediction that I made before friday was that if we went up, it would make a large amount of difference in the amount of gain in april"
1617136448,and its already starting to partially play out
1617136470,we are already at 58500 and we were at 59ish earlier today
1617136484,I dont think we would have seen this level of growth if the bears won last friday
1617136504,IMO friday was a deciding day on how hard april's push is going to be all together
1617136544,Im very very bullish for the month of april now instead of the only slightly bullish opinion I had before friday
1617136771,good year for crypto

1617137802,When it went from like .28ish back up I made like 600% on that
1617137866,what leverage?
1617137885,Back then 50x lmao
1617137900,lmfao ohh
1617137909,Then got back in before the weekend at .38 on and off at 20x
1617137984,wooow

1617138023,The fluctuations have been working out for me
1617138057,Although looking at the charts I may stay in now and see if it can actually ATH. I was sceptical last week
1617138118,I feel that
1617138130,might take a look at chr again
1617138133,but im late to the party
1617138197,Just spot it dude
1617138213,Life doesn’t have to be all about futures
1617138232,But like I said it’s flavour of the month there’s be others 🤷🏻‍♂️
1617138252,Spot is fine
1617138268,"Long holding in future, why though"
1617138586,"Okay, **now** is a good time to *be* in AUDIO already. 😉"

1617139075,still dont get it but might be me that im fuzzy today
1617139296,@BASED? which HNT are you talking about? There are at least 2 coins with that acronym
1617139304,Helium
1617139309,The guy who made Napster
1617139358,ze dip coming oop
1617139445,"Okay, this really annoys me in this sphere: why do people use the same damn abbreviations for totally different coins?"
1617139468,"And additionally, spoken in that high Jerry Seinfeld voice:"
1617139487,What's with crypto abbreviations that make no sense with the name of the coin?
1617139499,i bought LINA/BTC hope it goes well
1617139501,
1617139511,HNT=Helium.  Really? Come on man!
1617139574,"You know that people are going to be buying the wrong coin,"
1617139592,"That’s not an abbreviation, it’s the symbol, also known as ticker. Just like how Swedish Krona is ”SEK”, makes no sense, but still being used."
1617139603,And that other coin with the same name will profit from a pump by it's same named fellow
1617139622,"Well SEK kinda works though,"
1617139633,Never seen that happen. Exchanges don’t have 2 coins with the same name
1617139640,If it is a combination of SE for Sweden plus K for Kroner
1617139647,Krona
1617139661,Wdym
1617139670,"Like hnt, hnt/usdt or hnt/btc?"
1617139674,Cause those are the same thing
1617139710,Yeah I’m confused also don’t think there’s been a coin with the same name
1617139723,Look up HOT for instance on Blockfolio: there are literally 3 different coins with HOT
1617139726,And also LIT
1617139730,And also HNT
1617139731,Maybe stock but that’s different
1617139737,Also I assume HNT is Helium Network Token
1617139746,HNT has two
1617139749,Ahhh thsy makes sense
1617139752,GRT has two
1617139760,graph and golden ratio token for some reason
1617139764,Felix how are you still alive
1617139764,Yes but no exchange has both GRT’s
1617139770,yea
1617139795,We only accept GRT/eth
1617139799,LINA has two
1617139802,We don’t accept GRT/eth
1617139807,different coins under the same name
1617139859,@Paragon how do you mean?  Bringing up valid points for discussion is somehow life threatening?
1617139916,It’s rather that you make remarks or ask questions that could be solved with 5 seconds of searching on google

1617141465,just read the guide on their website
1617141644,I'm watching the binance academy video but I figured people here would have better recommendations

1617142306,Ath is 347
1617142317,Theres a lot of good ones on youtube. But we can help you a lot here to a lot of us do futures. So just ask away.
1617142364,"I would recommend to anyone here, to learn proper TA before you even think about trading in futures"
1617142378,Can be really dangerous
1617142381,"@Jelle  Ah yes okay, I was looking at the charts on Blockfolio and when I went back 1 month to a year 315 was the highest price shown"
1617142383,CHR treating me nice today
1617142435,@Jelle do you have a recommendation for a way to learn TA?
1617142446,Youtube
1617142448,Proper TA as you say
1617142449,"CoinMarketCap.com is more reliable. For some alts, ATH was in Jan 2018^^"
1617142498,I also watched the indian lady her course. She was quite good

1617145847,I downloaded it and am extracting from the zip and there is a folder in there called MacOS

1617146265,Has anyone tried the cryptshot bot?
1617147304,I tried v3 and v4. Haven't had a chance yet with the new v7.2 but it will give it a try soon.
1617147678,better get MoonBot

1617147698,pre pump detector
1617147699,etc
1617147964,Are bots good to use?
1617148109,Have you profited?
1617148137,"Well, better than doing it manually which will almost guaranteedly rek you. We don't recommend joining pump-and-dumps at all though.
Better use a sound investment strat, there's much more to gain with that."
1617148155,"No, not with the old versions. Lost a bit."

1617149533,"I uploaded the zip file to virustotal.com and scanned it, and everything seems to be okay,"
1617149560,"But there's a weird folder called _MACOSX,"
1617149579,how much will stormx rise after vidoe you think

1617178846,and sell when it back

1617182097,Also Pundi is doing good.. I expect a big rise in the coming days
1617182152,"pretty stagnant for a days, coin swap is soon too"
1617182243,pundi is NPXS ?

1617182478,It was a wake up call
1617182483,40$
1617182486,No more futures overnight for me
1617182497,was 60$
1617182512,650 down
1617182519,It was 4000+
1617182525,jesus
1617182535,Buying high leverage dips
1617182537,how many positions u got rn?
1617182540,When it keeps dipping lol
1617182554,
1617182556,this fakeout I assume?
1617182579,ANKR really dipped
1617182582,"yeah I fell for those kind before, worst kind"
1617182584,Same with CHR
1617182605,But ok I got a nice entry point now
1617182618,I hope it holds
1617182621,if I'm gonna be honest
1617182642,"there's definitely chances of further dips, but definitely not as violent as this one"
1617182654,I am already selling to get into a lower leverage again 🙂
1617182655,and altcoins usually survive much better throughout more consistent dips
1617182664,"because these instant dumps kill everything, it's awful"
1617182684,"good, good"
1617182710,Even VET dipped almost to my entry point of last week
1617182738,"oh yeah I see, vet really got fucked"
1617182798,"so btc got pumped to 60k, people were getting into it to push for new ath and it all just dumped"
1617182829,"because from what I'm seeing in some altcoin graphs, some started slowly dipping as btc was nearing 60k, people were getting out and fomoing into btc to ride that new ath hype train"
1617182838,and that already set a bad precendent to begin with
1617182847,"so when btc dumped, they really got fucked"
1617182860,why are people talking about panic selling lol btc is down less than 1k from when I went to bed
1617182865,WNXM dipped 30%
1617182868,You can only imagine all the liquidations
1617182882,These btc dips just wreck alts
1617182887,Btc is stable
1617182891,Ya'll talking about BTC like it just dropped 10%
1617182898,Alts did
1617182902,"because it recovered back to 58k now... it dropped down to 56.8, that's 4k+ price drop, it's a big one to happen in the matter of a few minutes"
1617182909,More then 10% mostly
1617182934,That's not unusual for BTC and isn't really anything to fuss over
1617182937,"guys we get it, this wasn't such a big correction, but it all happened in less than 3 5min candles, it shook the market"
1617182953,stmx moving again nicely after days of nothing - happy with that
1617182958,"and for futures traders, it is very much a big deal lol"
1617182963,spot traders can sleep safely 😛
1617182965,yup
1617182984,and a lot of futures traders here now

1617188311,@Garcia is @Barry who was just banned for spam
1617188323,At least it's the same photo
1617188331,Barry Garcia!
1617188352,"And he's saying things like, if you use atomic wallet I've got great news for you"
1617188366,he didnt follow up that statement 😦
1617188369,what is the news
1617188372,How about VET?
1617188374,Barry kept talking about sliding into DMs
1617188381,@Garcia what is this news man
1617188407,He wants to slide into your DMs
1617188431,With some thick spam
1617188448,"Hoping for a move on EGLD - was my 1st ever buy, gone back in as low again. so fingers crossed"
1617188471,bearish for a couple of days\
1617188474,and then a breakout
1617188478,is probably what happens to egld
1617188484,but breakout could be on the downside
1617188488,"if it is, coin probably ded"
1617188586,went to set sell limit and clicked market no loss other than the fee - grrrr
1617188608,wait u sold egld?
1617188622,no other coing
1617188629,Just keep an eye on it. It may breakout next few days. Only been downtredning a few days.
1617188654,my first guess at breakout point was the 4th (in aus)
1617188658,so 3rd in usa
1617188679,"do i take profit from stmx, buy orders still look strong,"
1617188831,I have a Binance conspiracy theory for you guys here:
1617188856,who has paypal
1617188866,we are not an exchange discord
1617188871,try somewhere else :p
1617188893,perhaps try an actual exchange?
1617188907,I will tell u if I ha e PayPal if u first PayPal me 100 dollars
1617188907,"Okay so yesterday I was about to sell my BNB at the top because it hit 314 or something, and I was even asking people here about selling.  Then, Binance announced TOKO and say that you have to keep BNB in your spot,"
1617188916,And then today BNB dumps
1617188922,Pretty clever
1617188939,must admit I am looking forward to sending profits to my paypal and buying stuff the wife cant see
1617188966,Like hookers?
1617188966,Unlikely
1617188986,you expect a BTC drop again?
1617189003,aint making that much
1617189020,Lol
1617189051,"What's the next recommend ICO to get involved in? (Not including Casper option 4, MINA and Boson)"
1617189064,DN
1617189079,@Typhoon I was just with your wife and she said she doesn't care what you buy
1617189094,anyone heard of AIOZ ?
1617189098,As long as you pay for our island getaway
1617189107,Spot doing good
1617189116,nice
1617189123,now lose it all on futures
1617189131,See spot run
1617189151,"As a cat, I get chased by spot quite often"
1617189164,
1617189170,Enj shit as always
1617189182,lmao ENJ
1617189183,damn nice bro
1617189187,That golden egg
1617189195,except that white theme
1617189242,ENJ ripped you off damn
1617189274,I hope the jumpnet in a couple of days will poomp it
1617189283,
1617189290,this is my baddest position
1617189300,been like break even 5-6 times the last weeks
1617189306,and then it tanks again
1617189498,Are you from below the river @Sjoerd de Jong
1617189516,Which river are we talking?
1617189544,If you're from NL you will know
1617189585,And if you're from Belgium you're definitely below the river
1617189626,The Netherlands has many Rivers
1617189637,I'm from the beautiful city of Enschede 🙂
1617189654,Ahaha you don‘t know the expression @Sjoerd de Jong ?
1617189672,No clue haha
1617189718,i have
1617189729,@Jelle he wouldn't because he's practically German ;)
1617189878,I am form Leeuwarden
1617189925,@jessevdv10 definitely above the river
1617189997,yes hahah
1617190005,I NEED HELP
1617190028,"https://coinlist.co/rly
https://coinlist.co/help/how-was-the-final-price-per-token-for-the-rly-token-sale-and-distribution-determined
For the people who want to participate in the Coinlist Rally sale tomorrow, April 1st:
- The sale price is $0.60 per token, current price of RLY is $1.13, so you can buy for almost half price
- There is a 6-12 month lockup of the tokens. If it sustains the current price in that time, you'll make a nice +100%
- In my opinion it's a promising project which could increase in price as well in that period
- If you want to participate, register / send funds to Coinlist today to avoid problems on the sale day
- There will probably be a lottery system again on Coinlist so you're not guaranteed the option to buy!"
1617190083,Maybe something for the podium!
1617190124,I brought that up last night!
1617190128,yes?
1617190133,But no one responded
1617190137,RlY
1617190140,I mean
1617190142,@NightmareWasTaken i can try to help
1617190144,RLY
1617190211,What’s up with DOT?
1617190219,My hangup is having anything locked for 6 months to 1 year
1617190235,Kind of a deal breaker for me
1617190245,lets hope its not as hard to get them as Casper was!!
1617190251,At least w Casper you can freely exchange
1617190258,only on option 3
1617190272,Yeah but I only went for option 3
1617190296,Casper had waaaaaay more hype
1617190316,"meh, not an issue for me. I think if you participate in an ICO, it something you hold fo a while, rather than want to sell immediately"
1617190327,Oh RLY?  There's not a rally around $rally?
1617190341,"Remember, it is not an ico"
1617190344,https://tenor.com/view/oh-really-o-rly-owl-gif-7905924
1617190355,It is for further token distribution
1617190384,The coin is already in circulation. You can just buy it for a nice discount
1617190387,TKO is an ICO
1617190393,"yep, was just referring to the Casper ICO option 3 from @felixthechat"
1617190420,Let's hope TKO doesn't get body slammed - total knockout would be bad
1617190430,Oooh oke👍🏻👍🏻
1617190440,"Binance has a good system, read up on it"
1617190449,Hard Cap of 200k tokens per user
1617190471,And any that would go over that are redistributed among the pool of users according to % bnb dedicated
1617190500,Tko FA is shit imo. But so was Alice. I Expect gains from it
1617190541,FA?
1617190561,Fundamental analysis
1617190577,Alice was stonks
1617190599,"its a minor pump for their own BNB though reading it now - ""7 day BNB holdings""..."
1617190616,Why do you think bnb went close to ath
1617190629,I purchased a lot at €180
1617190636,"Every time you bring up Alice it breaks my heart.  She was my girlfriend, and I lost 2.5k USDT by buying at ath"
1617190641,Pretty good roi aside from staking
1617190654,That actually had other reasons
1617190660,Such as
1617190669,Bitcoin going vroom?
1617190674,The visa announcement
1617190676,wow how do you make so much money
1617190678,amazing
1617190691,Breakout of big pattern. Quarterly token burn coming
1617190695,i got 55K$
1617190714,Oh wait BNB is going to be worth even more then
1617190734,Because last token burn jumpstarted the price iirc
1617190757,anyone has any tips for getting short term quick profit
1617190763,like 3 % smth
1617190777,"buy BTC, hold"
1617190790,@Hero Wick definitely not more plastic surgery
1617190792,I have never bought BTC to hold
1617190794,"Yeah, but we are now yet to see what it will bring this time. I bought a bag at 250 so already good gains here"
1617190795,Ever
1617190801,Ever ever
1617190818,haha
1617190827,alright thanks i will look into it
1617190954,I never thought about buying BNB as an investment. Do you think its worth it?
1617190962,long term
1617190975,like maybe buying 10 and just putting them away for a while
1617190990,"Okay so for you older traders on here, what are some of the ways you can make money with investing?  So holding long term, day trading, swing trading, using leverage, futures, options,"
1617190998,"Staking,"
1617191010,^^ all of the above
1617191015,I'm just trying to come up with a comprehensive list
1617191034,Long term not imo
1617191046,The only ways I've been able to really make money so far is swing trading or hodling
1617191057,"But I want to get into futures and margin,"
1617191065,Isn't BNB best pump
1617191069,I'm starting that TA course now
1617191071,like % out of top 5
1617191074,By the Indian lady
1617191151,STMX babyyyy
1617191212,Bnb is way to centralized imo
1617191232,"But think about it: Binance is the top exchange,"
1617191248,"And people will be using BNB because they have an incentive to do so,"
1617191255,Since it is the house currency
1617191263,The house always wins
1617191272,"It's a bit like the US dollar global reserve currency,"
1617191284,Since everyone has to buy oil in USD
1617191298,So isn't that bullish for BNB?
1617191330,"I mean lots of normies are just getting into crypto this year,"
1617191347,And Binance has a big position in this market thus far
1617191413,"And when Binance gives you incentives to hold BNB, like lower fees or the vault what they are doing with TKO,"
1617191422,"Sure, but when bnb changes something in their terms (which they can do easily). The price can go down real big. Therefor I dont have it in my long term pf. Doesnt mean that you shouldnt as well😉"
1617191425,People will hold it and buy it
1617191468,@Jelle gotcha
1617191517,"Well I understand that in the sense that when I make my millions, I will take my crypto off any central exchange and keep it secure on an external wallet,"
1617191534,And I would want to be holding cryptos that have long term staying power
1617191565,"But medium term, in the acquisition phase,"
1617191566,ADA
1617191576,BnB has potential for earnings
1617191609,It’s calm for the past week hopefully will launch soon
1617191612,I am currently very bullish on bnb
1617191624,Yeah might toss a long x10 on ada
1617191635,When you long a coin
1617191636,As decentralisation hits today
1617191639,How does that work
1617191653,Say if I long 10x xrp and I put 400$ what happens
1617191686,you get liquidated when it drops 10%
1617191695,or make profit
1617191697,Meaning?
1617191707,you loose your 400
1617191741,SUP LADS
1617191747,What if it does go up
1617191752,What happens to my 400$
1617191770,also a factor 10
1617191781,"I think you just need to apply a factor on the market mouvement 
If it goes up 10% x10 you get 400$"
1617191784,so 10% becomes 400
1617191791,STMX still has room to run
1617191799,Lol how does that work than
1617191806,How do you make money shorting or longing a coin
1617191903,"Shorting is like loaning a coin. So you get a debt to refund. So let say you loan 1 btc worth 50k 

If market goes down you buy a btc at 40k and refund your 1 btc debt"
1617191939,But if market goes up you still need to refund it but will cost you more money
1617191970,"Shorts have the possibility of infinite losses,"
1617191983,Just like longs have the possibility of infinite gains
1617192002,"Shorting is more dangerous,"
1617192021,But I think it’s a bit different with crypto there’s few options preventing you to enter in personal debt
1617192043,liquidation you mean :p
1617192043,You will just lose the money you have at max ?
1617192047,yes
1617192048,Yeah
1617192061,I just do 125x cross shorts
1617192067,No pain no gain
1617192086,But some brokers accept money you don’t even have I think ? So you enter in debt and your life become a mess
1617192091,Say I long xrp
1617192098,And it goes to 10$ this year
1617192106,What happens if I put 500$ on that
1617192113,What’s the current price ?
1617192121,0.5?
1617192121,0.55?
1617192123,Iirc
1617192150,"10/0.5 = 20x increase 

500x20 = 10000$"
1617192163,XRP will never go to 10$ probably
1617192171,@Azura it's basic math. calculate the percentage of how much it grows from 0.5 to $10 and that's your % of profit x leverage amount
1617192188,I see does that have a time frame or anything
1617192196,It needs 450b market cap to go there. Not going to happen
1617192196,Really
1617192212,"perpetual contracts don't, but they're sustained every 8 hours with funding fees, which vary"
1617192217,I mean they’re about to pour a trillion dollars into the market this month
1617192229,It will need to have twice the market cap of ETH to get to 10$
1617192231,So eho know
1617192246,Use this to calculate. https://thecoinperspective.com/?c=XRP
1617192276,450b is double eth's market cap. not happening
1617192307,I need a pipeline
1617192313,please make suggestions
1617192329,I need a 100x on 10000$
1617192340,same
1617192341,Same
1617192345,😂
1617192347,Loool
1617192355,Anyone know any good coins?
1617192370,for a *100?
1617192373,Yeah
1617192379,HARD is due a reversal but it may drop further first.
1617192382,I’m in telcoin and vra already
1617192391,leverage 125* with 10k and hope for a green candle
1617192396,easy *100
1617192407,On what kittie
1617192414,What do you mean leverage
1617192424,I mean to do a *100 you would need to have an ICO
1617192426,Easy *0 you mean haha
1617192431,or something that is not yet on binance
1617192436,a project that you believe in
1617192453,but then you need be willing to invest 10k in a single project
1617192464,Let holo drop then invest
1617192478,What do you guys think about vra and tel?
1617192487,I believe in both projects
1617192493,Neither are on binance yet
1617192507,also be aware that you are in the middel or perhaps the end off a bull market
1617192509,Vra has a small market cap and nice team and goal
1617192511,middle*
1617192519,Best way to make 100x is to find a good project that's not yet listed anywhere and get in as early as possible. Though you need to do a lot of research to find those gems
1617192540,Telcoin is a remittances coin that has great potential
1617192543,What do you think
1617192544,Yeah you do. So many ICO's its hard to pick.
1617192555,ICOs being what?
1617192565,Initial coin offerings
1617192569,finding AND SHARING here with us.. that the key to x100 😋
1617192578,Just as expected

1617192677,Are you eating money?
1617192687,I think its a red day overall for people with leverage :p
1617192692,I never withdraw profits
1617192699,Neither do i
1617192700,And continue to invest with everything
1617192704,So when I lose
1617192708,I lose everythint
1617192718,If you don't mess with futures you never lose

1617193794,Must be nice
1617193796,Remember that the cheap ones are a profitable source for btc holders to rent even more their profit
1617193840,At the beginning I thought Btc was the best (before I got into crypto)
1617193847,but btc 100k is only 2x
1617193868,That's why I put my money on the great projects but cheap
1617193902,Im in Zil Neo and stmx
1617193911,Im looking for 1 more
1617193920,ALGO
1617193926,HOT is a great project

1617196682,We dont take part in scams
1617196729,I can show y a video on YouTube guy predicts numbers in casino and those numbers came up. Can he really do it ?
1617196769,All I know is that pampas are a hamster haircut))
1617196792,taking part in pump and dumps the odds are always against you
1617196798,whatever you show us :p
1617196820,Winner only the organizer the rest is sheep to slotter
1617196844,Hardly
1617196870,Unless he show cash and can send us some. Then I’ll trust him as it would prove it works and he can easily make back what he gifted 😉 want by BtC address ?;)
1617196896,I take eth too and USDT 🙂
1617196904,So what do we think BNB is going to do?
1617196907,GBp even better

1617196943,I just know what coin they'll remember
1617197047,I work with the whales))
1617197201,"I understand that it's hard to believe)
I'm ready for any checks))))
I just don't have such a lot of money to raise on the pumps. If you only take a loan from a bank"
1617197217,so you are the person scamming us?
1617197224,and you come here to take our money
1617197229,because you know the coin before us
1617197230,nice
1617197239,WOW and u have time to chat with discord to help guys make money or the way ? Wow
1617197257,no.
1617197264,Take a loan and make money if it’s good money 💴
1617197317,"your advice is, loan money, become a whale in pumps"
1617197324,and then dump on the plebs
1617197337,it will work I guess :p
1617197389,Closed at .43 with CHR
1617197399,Playing it safe
1617197428,still in with the half :p
1617197439,closed 50% at 4.27
1617197463,"Think about it, pumps once a week, what do I do the rest of the time?
I just had the idea to assemble a team and get % of the profit.
Moreover, I place OSO orders to minimize the risk.
They stopped the last pump in a minute"
1617197651,Team is good idea but this chat is not the place to assemble one 🙂 we trying hard to be safe than sorry.  And I tend to stick to it. I joined here and like it cause there is no let’s all guy this! It’s pump time! This one is GoLD! Etc
1617197810,This place literally all people who got scammed by pump and dumps
1617197827,I have made more money talking here than any shitty pump group
1617197845,Exactly
1617198016,It is obvious that only those who buy cryptocurrency in advance earn money at the pump. That's why I didn't participate in the pumps before I found out what currency to buy
1617198053,It is obvious that only those who buy cryptocurrency in advance earn money at the pump. That's why I didn't participate in the pumps before I found out what currency to buy
1617198147,"I don't know how to prove otherwise. 
I can go live and show my orders"
1617198182,We pretty much dont care about pump and dumps. You are wasting your time here bud
1617198580,U don’t need to price anything. Just move on 🙂 to next chat to look for victims/team
1617198724,why dont my alt go with BTC when it pumps
1617198727,not fair 😂
1617198755,:kekw: :kekw: :kekw:
1617198783,Here's how to prove that I'm not cheating?Can you tell me?)
1617198827,easy
1617198834,tell us a coin before it pumps next time
1617198834,:p
1617199145,"If you knew, would you tell me? Or what would you do?
Just think about it. You know, but how do you make more money while these pumps are running? 
They will not be there and I will not be able to lift them anymore"
1617199459,If i come to a place stating i somehow know what coins would be pumped. Yes i would tell to prove legitimacy
1617199569,The only thing he pumps is the cocks of other men in back alleys
1617199619,very funny
1617199625,I don't get it how easy it is for some people to lie
1617199627,Real money profits is the prove. Not screen shots.
1617199649,Very 🤣
1617199726,I'm not lying.
1617199745,so to recap
1617199757,"you have a team, that searches for prepumped coins"
1617199766,and if we pay to get in that team we can get the signals?
1617199771,"so I bet 200 $ and got 400 $ /
Is that a lot?"
1617199786,"dude, do you even leverage ..."
1617199791,Can I give you 10k euros?
1617199800,I can send it to your bank account
1617199805,Give it to me
1617199815,And I’ll promise to spend it on blackjack and hookers
1617199822,Instead of just disappearing
1617199839,I always invest in Nigerian Princes
1617199866,"I have made so much money by responding to emails from African royalty who ask me to send them money,"
1617199882,"you can put it yourself from your account
Will you throw me 5% of the profit?"
1617199888,And I usually send a few thousand to their bank account and then I am richly rewarded!
1617199899,I am now considered a King in Nigeria
1617200018,"Okay so if I pay you 10k you first need to send 20k to a bank account I will give you, an escrow account, as collateral"
1617200044,"Once that is confirmed as received, I will transfer the 10k to any bank account of your choosing"
1617200057,And will then refund the 20k
1617200121,"why would I throw it? 
Is this a child writing?"
1617200139,I admire your commitment to your case
1617200200,"Yes, I am in fact a child. A Nigerian child prince"
1617200243,Crown Prince Akeem Joffer
1617200318,"Yes, because it is real.
I do not know how to do anything to make someone believe. 
Everyone does not believe and misses this opportunity! I don't understand why.
In short, if someone believes at least a little bit, then write in private messages"
1617200430,BEL ready for launch (need to break 4.8)

1617203740,Anyone buying tonight RYly? It’s going to be lottery as per email same q as Casper thing less hype so probably not 100k in line.  I’ve tried to open on Website it says sale ended lol like caper message.
1617203936,Maybe it was an April fools joke
1617203945,Since it's scheduled for April 1
1617203977,RLY though doesn't interest me too much for a couple reasons
1617204174,Buy AGA instead 😉
1617204282,35 minutes until REEF testnet launch 😄
1617204321,I would it it would be easy buy. I don’t habe meta Wallet and all other things u need to register with
1617204536,It's easy to get MetaMask Wallet though.
1617204547,I used Trust Wallet
1617204608,They made it easier by supporting BUSD on BSC. It was a hassle before with USDT and gas fees.
1617204709,"I remembered somebody here said that CHZ will have something today, that has a possibility to make it go up at least"
1617204839,Literally been said and posted that reef will have something huge today
1617204841,But alright
1617204871,25 minutes until testnet launch
1617204888,should i stream it?
1617204893,Yeah I bought some during today’s dip
1617204899,nice same
1617205270,Yeah I'm going to attempt to buy some
1617205284,$100 min to $1000 max which is good
1617205306,Already loaded CoinList with funds but not even sure that matters by the sounds of it
1617205327,I have 300 left from failed Casper option 3
1617205360,So I’ll probably buy rally as seems it’s sort of easy double money
1617205544,"I do have to add that RLY is already tradable on KuCoin:
https://trade.kucoin.com/RLY-USDT
It went down to $0.62 last week (sale price is $0.60), so it could be that the price drops below the sale price in the coming weeks/month as well for a better entry"
1617205594,Especially if the BTC bull-run ends during the 6-12 month lockup
1617205634,COME ON
1617205657,"Or it could be that RLY is never going to get below the $0.60 mark again and the Coinlist sale will be your best entry, it's a bit of a gamble"

1617206610,Massive btc pumps causes alts to bleed since everybody want in on those 2% of btc gains for some reason
1617206611,people fomo and sell their altcoins to ride the btc train into new uncharted territories and gain profit on new ATHs

1617206719,No way in hell that the entire alt market goes up and down together with btc
1617206729,pretty much
1617206732,every alt ate bricks
1617206735,when it went down 2%
1617206739,@fffffffffffff yes still holding BTC
1617206768,most likely bots causing a lot of the effect
1617206771,you're right
1617206791,People rely so much on automation
1617206795,man 59.7k really slapped it down
1617206818,From 2013? 😳 diamond hands
1617206849,Wait then u got lotsa cash
1617206859,The fuck you doing losing it on crypto
1617206919,he probably bought a small amount
1617206926,otherwise he wouldnt be here with us degens
1617206940,btc going for it again
1617206944,this is fun to watch lol
1617206975,yeah just noticed
1617206983,been away the whole day after the dip
1617206986,and bought more egld
1617206993,🤑
1617207018,"@fffffffffffff actually 2011 and 12, sold a bunch in 2017 but the rest kept this whole way"
1617207063,do we expect anything later tonight when midnight strikes and we hit April 1st and get a whole new monthly candle?
1617207085,because it feels like we're in a run up
1617207248,Way too complex for little old me.... I'll skip that one I think
1617207286,Why the fu*k can't I just visit the website at X time and press purchase and transfer some crypto
1617207357,I wonder what price the private Boson ICO guys bought at if the minimum auction price is 0.75
1617207386,In other news StudentCoin is on Delta app now
1617207396,Easier to track my full pf
1617207749,i personally expect another 60k reject for btc
1617207760,maybe smaller than this one we had
1617207766,but i think we could get another reject
1617207829,possibly yeah
1617207836,definitely ready for any outcome
1617207849,@ post grad
1617207857,When can I 50x my money on a stupid coin
1617207864,So I can recover my losses
1617207868,:kekw:
1617207902,chz is still below entry price from #🍻signal-bar
1617207908,that's a good entry
1617207917,Might fuck around
1617207921,And fuck myself over
1617207927,😁
1617207929,just low leverage please
1617207935,It’s good for us right ? As im bleadibg lol
1617207936,No
1617207943,We must recover with one shot
1617207947,lol
1617207950,revenge trading
1617207952,my favorite
1617207982,Might fuck around and get liquidated
1617207987,:kekw:
1617208010,"chz has little seizure pumps almost every day, sometimes more than once per day"
1617208016,just wait that one out and cash out
1617208024,get back in when it recovers and go again
1617208030,Do you have bad losses Richy
1617208035,one of these will be the one that breaks its resistance and then it will fly
1617208108,So it’s good price now to buy CHR?
1617208124,i was talking about CHZ
1617208142,"idk about chr, I'd say right now's a good entry"
1617208148,chr has been waking up lately
1617208160,and actually increasing steadily
1617208164,Yes
1617208167,😁
1617208171,keep in mind tho that btc has been derailing it massively
1617208179,whats the deal with HOT?
1617208188,so we have to expect it to happen again in the worst case scenario
1617208216,is HOT  a good entry because its been going up for ages..
1617208222,i just been ignoring it
1617208223,silly
1617208225,I actually meant CHZ lol
1617208230,oh ok hahah
1617208234,yeah def a good entry
1617208239,0.50 is gucci
1617208261,"but please be careful, from all the coins I follow, CHZ took the biggest dump when btc slipped"
1617208268,so it's a rather volatile coin
1617208276,"which... you know, can be exploited for massive gains"
1617208294,Yes. I’ll buy ans out sale order for 10/20% 🙂
1617208316,Probably actually 0.45 🙂 (in GBP here)
1617208317,CHZ really?
1617208322,hot looks pretty hot to me
1617208329,CHR risky entry at .42 I would wait for more of a dip
1617208344,It strangles last 2 days
1617208379,to me it looks like its going to go down
1617208383,but im a noob so
1617208409,money flow is going out now in 5min chart
1617208428,5min chart is not good for checking out money flow
1617208437,unless you're scalping
1617208472,FIL makes 25% evryday wth
1617208479,whats scalping
1617208495,does it ingenious?
1617208497,smh
1617208499,i been stuck
1617208503,with dodo for the last 3 weeks
1617208510,hodl faith is wack..
1617208530,i sold a yesterday
1617208535,it
1617208577,good? its marvellous lad
1617208593,"another reject, another buy opportunity to lower your entry prices"
1617208604,and the uptrend goes slower
1617208607,more natural
1617208613,so we all win but the shorters
1617208616,fuck em'
1617208858,Buying BTC? Or u mean deeps in general ?
1617208919,"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNFt7X5JnjR/
CryptoBirb's take on Bitcoin situation right now."
1617209139,"Bought at 0.37, farming Alice rn"
1617209206,"was waiting for it to go back down to $125 before buying more, but now I doubt that’ll happen anytime soon"
1617209262,The BTC dump was actually good for LUNA tbh. It dipped LUNA hard but then it kinda popped it out of the rut it was in all day yesterday
1617209474,Btc goes up ada down 😢
1617209497,chz really bleeding right now
1617209501,I longed ada
1617209505,Good I got out

1617209734,fuck yeah
1617209737,good stuff
1617209785,We take those Ws
1617209883,Greed fucked me so far today lol
1617209907,Ya. Greed will do that to ya. SL are my friends
1617209921,TP in this case :p
1617209942,Nah I move my SL to avoid getting greedy and losing profits
1617209950,your SL can be in profit range
1617209966,I do this for short term positions
1617209972,long term positions I dont mind a little red
1617210020,This ensures you secure at least a small bag if things start going bad
1617210042,Its like rock climbing
1617210056,move your safety harnesses up as you go up
1617210145,Long term positions I dont do this due to the fact that I normally just buy the dip instead.
1617210277,"whatever, 99% of coins follow bitcoin"
1617210280,just look at today charts
1617210449,Everyone wanted to ban the guy shilling Wink this morning
1617210458,
1617210478,😹 😹
1617210496,He was right
1617210510,"I know the hate on ENJ is real, but that thing has pumped 3 times in the last 24h... keep an eye on it, plenty of opportunities to make some quick profit"
1617210548,Waiting on the daily ANKR pump 😦
1617210559,"I'd imagine the pumping will continue at least until april 6th, when jumpnet launches. after that, idk.."
1617210582,That is when the belgian 50X shorts the ever loving shit out of it
1617210592,lol
1617210601,
1617210639,Why people stick with ENJ when theres so many better opportunities out there
1617210640,sorry guys but im one of them
1617210643,"omgg look at WIN coin its 0,0004 cents its gonna explode in next 4 weeks Mark this post , WIN/USDT is a big gambling company in Las Vegas who just joined crypto so you pay crypto coins to gamble!! Volume coming hard!!
pt 1 month 0,10 cents for sure because the gaming gamble industry is going up!!🤑🔥"
1617210647,Its the spam they aren't allowed to do. One dude sent the same message within 3 minutes after already being warned
1617210679,"without a doubt, don't get me wrong. just pointing it out incase other coins are moving sideways and people are looking into one that is more active"
1617210681,Thing is he probably pumped it by shilling it in all discords and it worked
1617210698,There was multiple people sending the same mesage
1617210700,😹 😹
1617210709,I seriously doubt that person was the one that created the shill
1617210720,its like the student coin spam
1617210727,Just a script
1617210727,StudentCoin is ace
1617210729,If it was like that ENJ would be at 1000$
1617210745,"Regardless of the quality of the coin, its still spam"
1617210775,"Sending the same message over and over again with most of these people not even doing TA on it, just spamming it because they bought in and get commission when people use their codes"
1617210781,*Multiple bots
1617210798,Get enough of them in enough large discords and it might just work
1617210833,Tempted to buy loads of some Ultra lowcap stuff and create a shilling bot
1617210841,"Analyze every situation, or are you defenders of the theory that the earth is flat?"
1617210854,can i get 10
1617210857,jk
1617210858,Stonks
1617210860,Everyone would do that
1617210862,Can you piss off for once
1617210864,Duhhhhh
1617210866,Even if ment joking
1617210868,why u change pfp?
1617210875,Shilling works..
1617210880,Audio dipping..
1617210880,To represent the mental anguish caused by people like you
1617210891,Don't believe that
1617210908,It works for the people who bought the initial bags tbh
1617210915,normally fucked over every person after
1617210923,its basically a long term pump and dump
1617210925,🤷‍♂️
1617210928,80% of this chat have been shilling ENJ
1617210931,I love how semi-intelligent jokes are atleast appreciated here
1617210952,Or are you too noobs or shilling doesn't work
1617210956,Thats because
1617210960,Im pretty sure it was 2 people doing most of the shilling
1617210961,They fucking do futures
1617210965,for ENJ
1617210966,And not buy the actual coin
1617210980,Which cucks the entire idea of shilling
1617210991,like ENJ Knight had like over 1000 messages alone that included the words ENJ
1617211015,he stopped when he saw ENJ dip 🤣
1617211015,"So if you are sure that's like that, why wouldn't we join forces for 1 low cap coin?"
1617211051,Because we’re too idiotic to actually be competent
1617211054,It’s the internet
1617211068,I thought people here were smarter
1617211091,"Its not a guarenteed success; Depends on the coin, and the amount of people who fall into the shill and shill and its honestly just as bad as setting up a pump and dump"
1617211098,"If we didn't believe the guy why would other groups believe, he was just right"
1617211121,Homeless
1617211124,Because there are people who actually believe pump and dumps arent a scam
1617211127,Even a stopped clock is right twice per day
1617211141,I'm in on that. Are you a Dev too?
1617211149,Jeremy I thought you were smarter too
1617211152,I got a good target
1617211164,But you believe too much in conspiracies
1617211200,Go to southxchange. XSH has low volume. Low cap. Easy target :dababy:
1617211204,"“Hi yes I’m the ENJ developer, we just confirmed a partnership with MacroHard gaming and ElectronicAss”"
1617211214,You are bringing no points to the table. Shilling does work at times just like elon's tweets pumping doge. Massive amounts of people buying in works. Shilling shouldnt happen and its toxic but it does work at times
1617211215,“Please make our coin go x1000%l
1617211222,People are dumb asses
1617211226,people fall for shit
1617211233,Don't compare random dudes with Elon please
1617211252,Im comparing the situations because its mass views
1617211262,Both are viewed by a large amount of people
1617211282,that is why they in theory could affect the market even though most of the time they dont
1617211323,"Jeremy end of topic, you're just too dumb or you don't want to give me reason"
1617211351,I have literally given several reasons. You have given zero on your point. you have just given insults out
1617211359,Guys pump xsh
1617211363,Please
1617211370,All you said was shilling works
1617211392,I have given reasons on why it can work. you have given none on the opposite ends of the spectrum
1617211431,In that casa I don't buy it that it was that
1617211457,It's difficult for me to argue due to language barrier
1617211471,And you don't understand Portuguese do you?
1617211506,Well then you say that. you dont call people idiots. If you just dont believe in something then you put your opinion out and that is that. you have been being very aggressive for no reason
1617211533,Sorry Jeremy ❤️
1617211549,You got reason in that
1617211586,Its ok ❤️
1617211637,Im honestly so pumped. I get all friday to trade because its good friday so I am off work
1617211640,would u mind if i asked u if i could get 10 bucks haha get troled

1617212025,hey at least you are still in. I lost 1 position last night to a stop loss
1617212034,Did u buy at the top drstonks
1617212043,the rest rebounded and ended up at higher profits than what I lost last night on the SL
1617212046,"Spot, I am always in"
1617212048,:dababy:
1617212072,you gotta go all in on a 125xer right before bed time
1617212085,i bought at 3.4 went down to 3.2 i sold
1617212085,wake up a rich person or a broke person
1617212096,That was a bold move
1617212113,lol
1617212135,Reduced my amount of position though
1617212140,Less diversity
1617212147,So one coin going down is a bigger L
1617212180,(Disclaimer: this comment is satirical and sarcastic. Do not take this as real TA advice. Adjust your leverage at your own risk and do not overleverage your positions)
1617212190,No one believes it bro
1617212193,Dw
1617212221,That one newbie that just got here and reads the advice and puts his entire life savings in it says otherwise
1617212228,:kekw:
1617212244,If they did a little reading they should know it's wrong
1617212247,"but at that point, isnt it just natural selection"
1617212253,Audio dipping like a  mf...
1617212258,Who joins a discord server and takes the first thing they see as advice
1617212262,U deserve it then
1617212265,ENJ be trying for the 6th time
1617212508,If only somebody shilled me into ENJ today 😦
1617212628,its been resident sleeper the last few days. I wouldnt have bought in even if it was shilled

1617212890,STMX PT - 130 satosh
1617212892,Doesn't wanna pump
1617212896,It's like luna but worse

1617212904,🪨
1617212913,luna actually benefited from the btc dip

1617213132,Nvm it wasnt allowing me to react for some reason
1617213158,I blocked you if it makes you feel any better ❤️ jkjk 😉
1617213186,Good :kekw:
1617213193,Sad thing is that my initial margin was so low that 3 bucks is only like 800 900 bucks :kekw:
1617213225,I feel that. ETH is only going to net me 700$ for pushing to 2k
1617213233,If i buy more 50X enj what happens
1617213247,It combines the positions and entry prices together
1617213248,Does my total profit get split in old entry and new entry
1617213262,Kinda yes
1617213273,@That one belgian super cunt are you feeling the storm now
1617213281,You will make the same profit as having two different positons
1617213286,Stmx?

1617213370,:kekw:
1617213392,"Buy low

1617213442,I might put more cash in ada tho
1617213460,Its not stupid above original entry
1617213481,I need a pipeline of investment ideas
1617213485,Please give me some
1617213487,Legit ran out
1617213623,Why did I sell Filecoin yesterday at 1.58?
1617213907,me with 200...
1617213934,hey dont focus on the PNL. Focus on the ROE 🙂
1617213984,still with 200...
1617213993,I got my friend started on crypto AND futures last thursday and I have already guided her into turning her 200$ into 260$ and most of the positions she created herself. I just gave her a heads up on what I was looking at. She decided her risk tolerance
1617214018,She also got into a few positions herself
1617214023,teach me
1617214043,"if i remembered right, she made 100 to 260"
1617214082,Nah its been 200->260 but its still great profits. Thats 30% increase in less than a week for a NEW trader
1617214125,There are tons of teachings that I give publically for everyone to learn from but most of my teachings are on Futures. its very important you learn TA first. Learning HOW to do your own research is the key to success in the crypto world
1617214141,Coinlist sales/ico's have performed quite well. An average of 2266% ATH ROI!
1617214155,you aren't going to have a good long term run relying on other people's research
1617214204,you gotta learn how to do your own. Find your own coins. Its great to take advice from others and maybe even pick up a few coin names to research from others but I never ever ever buy into a coin that I havent done my own personal analysis on first
1617214364,"Once you do that, you will win more often. I still take losses. Everyone closes on red from time to time but its all about learning how to minimize your losses and maximise your profits. I have 2xed my ENTIRE portfolio since thursday and that number includes the money that I dont even invest. I keep about 30-50% of my funds liquid for dips and margin protection meaning I have essentially had 4x profits on what I have put in positions"
1617214461,and dont focus on how much money you have. Focus on ROE. This will help when you start succeeding and scaling up. making 20$ off 200$ doesnt seem like a lot but thats +10%. Now imagine getting that same +10% when you scale up your operation to 2000$. Now you just made 200$. 200$ is a decent chunk of change
1617214485,Now you are at 10000$ and you made 10%. Congratulations you just made 1000$
1617214513,Nicd
1617214521,You gotta focus on ROE. PNL isn't important long term. Its consistently getting good ROE %
1617214836,whoever bought into file
1617214840,made big bucks
1617214905,"I'm just going to put 100$ in every Coinlist ICO from now, if it can maintain that average ROI I can make some good profits with it (DYOR)"
1617214927,Im the person that pumped file so anyone who made money off it please DM me so I can get my 10% cut from your profits 😂 /s
1617214930,seems like a good strat
1617214942,imagine :kekw:
1617214954,If i could ever focking buy coins from that shitsite :kekw:
1617214987,FUCK BOSON
1617214998,but if it gets to 20$ i might cry a little
1617215001,but it wont
1617215004,:kekw:
1617215049,now it for sure won't. You cursed it by speaking it's bad luck into existence
1617215067,Also if it tanks thats on u
1617215067,crypto always seems to do the opposite that I want

1617215619,me with 200...
1617215623,You ever heared the story of the guy who suddenly had the driving wheel of his tesla on his lap?
1617215624,I think the main reason of loosing money is btc dumps
1617215641,I started at 1k
1617215644,that was in january
1617215647,you can do it!
1617215663,I even lost 2k along the way to drunk trading one night
1617215664,What do you want it all spoon fed for you
1617215665,1k? to 10?
1617215672,yep!
1617215684,Iv now made 5k off of the last 6 days alone
1617215692,I think i did a 100% on my coins
1617215693,Januari was also the best time ever to start :p
1617215694,ok u gave me motivation. what is the tips and tricks?
1617215711,Because no way in hell i put over 5k in this
1617215716,And im at 13k now
1617215735,Last thursday was a good time to start too
1617215740,Yea
1617215743,I got my friend started last thursday
1617215744,I gained 8k
1617215745,shes up 30%
1617215750,Too bad I lost 8k before that
1617215759,And then when syl happens
1617215770,S T O N K S
1617215783,can i give a call
1617215786,I feel that I shouldn't stay here...
1617215796,IM NOT ON IT BUT CAN I GIVE A CALL?
1617215809,Advice*
1617215814,That’s allowed :p
1617215815,$dick will go to 5000
1617215834,but take a look at orn
1617215841,it can be a good entry
1617215845,Il probably try casper option 4. Its only 100 bucks
1617215847,now or tonight
1617215851,If i make a x 10 il be happy
1617215859,people are panic selling
1617215863,cuz platform is lagging
1617215865,what can it do?
1617215867,No futures on ORN 😭
1617215875,I am over leveraged already rn
1617215888,ahaha
1617215889,I need to exit some stuff before I go to bed :p
1617215896,Not enter
1617215900,I should really just put more fiat in :kekw:
1617215911,I should have started with 10k
1617215913,Put 3k more in. And spend it purely in calls
1617215919,Sigh hindsight
1617215932,
1617215936,see if it can go more dip
1617215948,or DYOR
1617215951,But no leverage
1617215961,What can I do on it without leverage
1617215965,You might be able to do 3x margin on it. Let me look
1617215979,in what?
1617215984,im the only one playing with out leverage
1617215986,Normal buying
1617216020,"I just checked, you can do isolated 3x on ORN spot"
1617216033,LETS GO MONKE ON ORN
1617216049,putting 60 into ORN!½
1617216057,BE CAREFULL I WAS JUST SAYING THAT CUZ THEIR PLATFORM IS LAGGING
1617216063,Just go to the coin and click isolated 3x. This works different than futures though as you will have to repay the margin at the end
1617216073,meaning it wont repay automatically
1617216073,Actually. If you do a margin. Do you have a funding percentage like futures or whatever
1617216107,Im just giving the info out to someone already interested in leveraging it. 100% DYOR
1617216109,"Or is it just ""give us back the usdt we lend you"""
1617216139,ye ty
1617216141,"I remember when i tried to do X 5 margin 200 bucks on enj and binance went ""we dont have enough stock for that"""

1617216296,futures but its the same game
1617216338,Hot is available on futures since yesterday
1617216344,egld can go 145 easy
1617216346,But I'm on futures rehab
1617216363,Cashing out at the end of april. 2000$ at 52000 is larger than 2000$ at 59000$ so you have more funding fees buying higher
1617216383,oh ok
1617216392,I found this out the hard way when I accidentally cashed in my 2700$ ETH profits
1617216405,I reopened the same position at higher and was paying 3x more fees
1617216411,it sucked ass
1617216443,7$ per funding->21$ per funding. At one point I was paying like 90$ a day on funding fees to keep the same liq price I had before. It was super sad
1617216502,ORN can hit 25
1617216574,ye for sur just 2 days

1617218802,NANO may actually pump a little next week. Binance and many other platforms have announced to unhalt the withdraw lock making it a more appealing crypto
1617218834,The estimated availability of withdraw on binance is 4/8
1617218855,~600k volume on 15 minute chart from ~4k previous candle
1617218861,looks like a pump lol

1617222327,Hi all
1617222353,it is welcome @eggetrunk
1617222363,Ty lord
1617222375,Is talking about PnD okay or banned in here?
1617222382,Had a few questions about it
1617222417,wdym by PnD?
1617222424,pump and dumps
1617222432,pump and dumps im guessing
1617222434,"it's not banned, but you'll likely find very little interest in them"
1617222437,Yes
1617222482,Ah I was wondering why do most people stay away from it when it's not illegal and so profitable
1617222526,because you probably have 1% to profit and 99% to get scammed
1617222538,A lot of people get ripped off because they go in thinking it’s gonna be a dead cert way to make a fortune
1617222548,Then this
1617222552,imo its not reliable one day you could make a hundred next day loose 200  the only real winners are admins mostly
1617222554,It's not profitable
1617222554,Someone gotta lose out for others to gain
1617222597,"Wym?
The PnD setup is a scam (like pumps don't happen) or that the late pumpers lose out ononey because they aren't able to sell?"
1617222638,PnD with bots are extremely reliable
1617222644,"Either way, I understand it's kinda fraud-ish ,in the sense you fool people and then grab their money"
1617222660,Does the bot work on Binance.US???
1617222687,"Doesn't matter if its US , works directly with your binance API"
1617222695,Sick!!
1617222695,but i'd sugest to dont go for binance bots
1617222699,go for KuCoin bots
1617222705,Why is that?)
1617222713,more coins with lower volumes
1617222719,easy pumps
1617222735,yesterday i earned 300 with 590USDT
1617222743,50% earnings
1617222743,"No, you'll lose when you participate because the pump admins will dump on you."
1617222756,dam good call
1617222787,What can I say? I'm a crazy mother fucker and sometimes the market gives me a bone
1617222802,whats the difference between binance and kucoin?
1617222812,i joined ya @ x30 nowhere near as much though
1617222821,kucoins have more coins?
1617222821,Hey profit is profit
1617222824,https://tenor.com/view/kp07-dog-angry-gif-7900691
1617222832,talking about bots?
1617222838,That be me!
1617222839,or just the exchange itself?
1617222848,true that
1617222849,exchange
1617222882,"PnD's are very risky and most people lose money with it. You may think you will get easy profits with a bot, but the market is currently so over-saturated with 100's of bots per pump, that even that is very risky now, as all of these bots are competing with eachother.
Kucoin pumps are generally not very good as they have very low liquidity, thus you have limited chance to sell your coins once you bought them."
1617222904,"a bit more functions on kucoin, but also seen friends having to do things like ""declaring"" your btc balance when u got more than 0.5 btc"
1617222916,binance  = less fees
1617222936,If you pump all the coins an hour before a PND at least one of them will be right 😉
1617222949,^
1617222964,:kekw:
1617222981,This is satirical and sarcastic. Don't take this as actual advice
1617222982,Ethereum doing bits
1617222997,well it depends on your config
1617223025,"if you know most of ppl are aiming to 100% on profits, cutting yours to 50 or 60 is a secured profit"
1617223042,"talking about bots ofc, dont even mind to get into a PnD without one, it's free money for admins"
1617223051,Yeah a 50% profit per pump is pretty huge
1617223067,How does a bot work?
1617223070,Here
1617223074,In pnd
1617223203,"Basically it detects a coin from a selected discord channel with a scramble function, once the coin is shown the bot automatically buys at the lowest price possible (when the signal is given) and then place orders of your choose. you can also place more than 1 split to sell, example 60% of the coins too be sold at 20% profit and then 40% of coins sold at 50% profit"
1617223209,Can anyone weigh in on staking CHR on Binance?  Is it worth it?
1617223216,"Well, buying potential pump coins days in advance and selling before the actual  is usually a really good strategie"
1617223244,oh for sure. I was just intending the buying ALL the coins statement lol
1617223264,"I'm guessing those bots are premium.
How do you use/install/integrate those bots"
1617223267,"that way u secure the first 60% by selling on 20%, then the rest is just YOLO... or not 
Eg tomorrow we're waiting for a pretty cool one , tested the bot with 40USDT the first beta, and reached 194% profit"
1617223273,Ethereum and btc pump is a thing tho
1617223282,wat the fuck nano
1617223282,I bought those years ago
1617223291,Anyone staking CHR for Alice?
1617223311,ofc they are
1617223335,I passed out on the couch. Oof
1617223338,"binance bot lifetime , with updates lifetime free too, around 200USDT"
1617223350,KuCoin (as it is more profitable) around 300
1617223352,Its shit
1617223367,"same functions, and soon will add a ""pre pump"" detector"
1617223374,And the bot you were talking about?
1617223388,"so if the coin is already so prepumped , the bot warns you, to dont close positions on loose"
1617223397,or even to dont buy
1617223400,"Why pay for a bot like that, when we got it all here? @L3nz Recens"
1617223405,....you are talking about beex
1617223409,When CHZ gonna hit 0.7 barrier?

1617225142,But in all wallet in the world you have to pay fees then
1617225145,Thats logical
1617225156,how are the fees on BSC?
1617225156,
1617225176,a ton cheaper than ERC-20
1617225185,THANK JEBUS
1617225188,🙏
1617225191,IIRC during my AGA buying ERC-20 was 15 bucks
1617225197,BEP-20 was like a bunch or less
1617225201,*buck
1617225205,yup
1617225215,so making a trust wallet is fine?
1617225218,and is a good option?
1617225265,honestly any new coin should just ditch ETH's network and go binance smart chain
1617225269,Either trust or meta should work fine
1617225286,We can all use mine bep 20 address
1617225293,What you think guys
1617225295,which has the better reputation?
1617225297,"Yeah, it conects easily with MATIC too. I like it a lot more than Meta"
1617225299,What gets created behind the scenes is a wallet on bsc chain
1617225311,lets all send to eacaee
1617225311,Trust wallet is the binance wallet
1617225323,Guys you use platform and dont know all about
1617225329,Stop going leverage
1617225329,yes
1617225333,Start learn
1617225338,:kekw:
1617225338,oy I am a keep on binance kinda guy
1617225341,learn after loss
1617225343,thats my motto
1617225346,and all I ever used was QTs

1617225466,It is exactly the same for all crypto before coming on exchange
1617225467,
1617225469,It’s just signals that you follow. Buy at the price it says and sell at the price it tells you
1617225470,GOOD OLD DAYS
1617225475,But do your own research regardless
1617225479,"On another note, anyone heard of PlotX yet"

1617225583,thank u. mean while ill try to follow youtbe subtitels
1617225757,there is no MAC trust wallet.. I think  i can do set up on my phone then.
1617225882,It should be very straightforward with Trust Wallet and this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsqvbwHNbSw
1617226021,The transaction fees are being paid by XSL
1617226077,ON it now! have to set on my phone as no wallet for mac:)
1617226092,"Yeah, I have it on my iPhone as well"
1617226153,Trust Wallet is dead simple
1617226180,Although they do say to have some BNB on Trust Wallet for future transaction fees?
1617226254,❤️
1617226257,😩
1617226269,thats beautiful on their part
1617226274,they got a yacht

1617226616,"Website says ""Error. Please try again"" in popup and then ""Come back from April 7 you can confirm the verification code you received on your BEP-20 address in Trust Wallet"" 😄"
1617226646,Friendly reminder that ada full decentralization occurs in 23 minutes 👀
1617226680,look at this beautifull app
1617226683,MAIAR FROM ELROND
1617226693,( my name is beyonce on it yes )
1617226704,Guys we’re getting our AGA tonight
1617226784,ah was worried the address on xsl website was wrong when the logo didn't change to the 'S' like it did in the YouTube vid
1617226853,0x7e52a123Ed6DB6Ac872A875552935fBbD2544c86 is address from youtube description correct or I need to find it on website?
1617226865,The address in the video should be the same as the one in the website
1617226875,yes it is
1617226880,From the smart contract
1617226886,It is also correct compare first and last digit
1617226969,So this will probably be a similar process? Set up a user defined token? Because I can't find AGA yet in Trust Wallet.
1617226989,"yep just checked it is, but their video has random capital letters, wonder if thats why the logo didin't show in the App when added"
1617227042,I figure the logo was just photoshopped in to make the video a little better looking
1617227049,ive pased it in and SYL SYL 6 appreared.. i didnt need to feel it up like in youtube video
1617227077,Perfect
1617227101,Thats cuz you did it after they add the token parameters in the trust wallet
1617227109,i am running a blank on what to do. :kekw: I know I send money from metamask. I know I picked the not ERC-20 option but what now. I got a sinus infection headache going on and I feel like my IQ dropped by 50
1617227110,I think I am set! have same as other guys posted above. 🙂
1617227115,So now it appears automaticaly
1617227159,Now we will all receive the test amount on the 7th april
1617227164,I am very exited my first ICO:p thanks to u guys.:) I am hopeful 🙂
1617227195,any thoughts for XTZ?

1617227357,i got in at 0.017 though
1617227363,me too
1617227363,the matic pick was only after I paid USDC. the payment was on ERC-20 anyway
1617227364,Niceeee
1617227372,did you call that on #🎓post-grads-podium ?
1617227397,"I mean MATIC is on ERC anyway so you should still receive it. But connect MATIC to Metamask, since that’s what you used, right?"
1617227409,yes
1617227410,"i wasnt ale to see it back then. But I am checking now evryday ""calls"":)"
1617227426,connect it before payout then.
