1615694904,"Wanted to post in a separate thread but either too new or bugged. So going here. -Plair signed on some exclusive license deals: After reading up on Plair from a Mar. 3rd interview with the CEO, converted some left over VTHO to PLA in the Vechain wallet via Vexchange, and figured one last shill (trying to be upfront and transparent) was in order. Sounds like the Plair team got fked out of the ultra competitive esports market from gaming juggernauts (Blizzard, etc.) and were forced to reevaluate. Rather than give up, they decided to enter the NFT market and apparently have some exclusive, LICENSED contracts. Excerpt below. ""We have already signed partners that have access to gaming/anime/toy intellectual property rights (IP). This will allow us to work with officially sanctioned NFT collectibles which I believe makes the space very interesting. Imagine being able to collect a Deer Chan Pandacute trading card or even as a hypothetical example, Dragonball Z NFT collectible."" Apparently they are working on an auction style nft incubator to allow artists to auction off their works. In the interview, CEO mentions trading baseball and basketball cards and even stamps as a kid. Might be a hint or a direction, or a style template i.e. something similar to a licensed trading card with their partners vs. straight up artwork. Name drops might be hints too. No idea if this will even go anywhere (meaning the devs and their nft), but normal price range is 0.00008. It's already listed on OceanEx and can also be acquired easily (by anyone afaik) via Vechain wallet's Vexchange.  Please, use common logic and don't go elbows deep as the calf might be stillborn....
