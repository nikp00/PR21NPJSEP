1616614106,not on coinbase :(,1
1616594668,Whichever you have. Probably easiest to start with usdt,1
1616590123,"No idea but if i look at the marketcap, i see that there is so much room for growth! 1 dollar or even more isnt a dream i think. But noone can be sure about anything in crypto",2
1616590238,"I would have thought ONE's run would have cooled off for a bit a long time ago, but it just keeps going. It has momentum with it, but in the short-term I think it will struggle to break through key psychological resistance at $0.5 and certainly $1, though both are still a long way off.",2
1616595180,I believe the same!! First to 1 dollar and then sky is the limit!,2
1616596611,"From everything I have seen and researched, ONE seems to have really good potential as a platform",2

1616577329,Binance listing can influence strongly the price,1
1616576239,"yeah it is bigger i think, but bittrex seems to be safer... 3 years ago as i started in cryptos i used cryptopia -> hacked so all my coins are frozen since years.... i thought bittrex will be safer than cryptopia, and after your post i read about binance, and it was hacked in 2019 also... i think i go with bittrex.",3
1616594051,"I’m also in us, KUcoin gives me a lot more options and works very similar to Bittrex, not as friendly about buying with fiat but still good",1
1616585213,I buy high sell low smh. Really need to Uninstall the app once a week after I buy 🤣,2
1616585173,Honestly It seems like a cool project I messed up and bought on voyager so I can't move it off to stake. My reason for getting out is I feel like I'm dipped into too many alt coins and want to consolidate on the ones I really feel good about.,1
1616613756,Its down right now too so now probably a good time to buy then? Ive got like 700 worth of Bitcoins but this is all foreign to me.  Anyways thanks for the reply,1
1616618174,"I have seen you mention ADA a few times and come across as passionate about it, where are you getting you info that it will recover? I got in at the wrong time and since it has kept falling, trying to decide if i should cut my losses.",1
1616617948,"Another noob here who got involved in ADA before the price dropped :( you say read around, where would you suggest as i have just been reading reddit and not getting anywhere",1
1616629176,this is vacation!  weeeeeeeeeeee  :),2
1616631274,Looks like this little BTC dip  ONE HELD ITS GROUND PRETTY WELL,2
1616631754,"i'll profit it within few days prolly, besides is not a lot of $$, but at least I am supporting it now, right?  I should get award or trophy or something..  ;p",2
1616631375,What area do you see it consolidating at?,1
1616632803,Reasoning?,1
1616635150,"Risky selling ONE, too. I tried to scalp it and mistimed it by quite a bit because it didn't correct; it just shot upwards. I bought back in for a $20 loss because I think it's a fantastic coin that already has use cases. I'm going throw it on the hodl pile for a bit.",1
1616599515,"Options set to expire on Friday, so maybe. Just assess risk vs reward is all.",1
1616620285,Hodl bro!!! It's usually a marathon. Torn between FOMO and FUN.,3
1616612195,"Yeah, same here. At this point might as well hold it and hope for it to return. One thing I do like us seeing an extra 1k hoge coins in my wallet everyday. It's nice to see something go up.",2
1616592410,Tiny mushroom caps,1
1616596392,"Hold to it and good things will come...(NFA)  Good luck bro,all the best....",2
1616596788,The previous token burning draws up the price 3x...really hope the swap on 30th will be great ( 🤞🤞🤞)...,2
1616596530,According to Pundi X team..the last few days was a healthy correction....,1
1616616935,Then you should sell ADA,2
1616620738,"People have gotten weak hands lately. Lol. Bull run back on from april, i know this is really consolidation phase",2
1616582220,on sale.,1
1616594135,Im wondering since everything else is green today but my investment ofc are not xD,2
1616622539,I totally agree. It's a huge opportunity,1

1616555607,where can I get started for making bank? any reccos??,1
1616560402,Any suggestions? Thinking about dumping my GRT that I bought close to its peak.,1
1616592874,Thanks. I was thinking of selling at a loss too but changed my mind. Will hold,1
1616565559,I told yesterday THETA can 5x from here and ENJ can 10x from here and no one believed me,2
1616561959,at ath? mental,3
1616580819,Hmm. Good to know. Recently I had only been using voyager as an exchange and wasn’t looking up prices on multiple exchanges before yesterday- so I was surprised to see the huge price discrepancy,1
1616592602,"What happend is I sent USDT from Binance to BNB in Trust Wallet. I was worried. However, the USDT reached Trust Wallet. Thank God.",1
1616580087,">Why u think so? I am seeing how it moves and rises slowly, at times it goes down, but only a little. I think is preparing to take off this week.",3
1616582561,Don't know about BAT but CRO tomorrow is releasing their mainnet.,2
1616617299,"do not fool people, that you have ADA does not mean that it is useful for anything ... ADA is finished, with the Binance network and that of DOT Cardano only has hype",1
1616633057,Yes you can on Kucoin,2
1616628166,Don't keep it a secret 🙂,1
1616633428,This. It's futures. Stuff would be down even more if it wasn't for an ill timed Elon tweet.,1

1616610547,2020 😂,1
1616592934,And NFT activity,1
1616594756,Thanks bro i put 900 ONE usdt and believing 🙏,3
1616577583,For me its about what Binance did when they were hacked. History shows they bounced back and everyone recieved their funds. In crypto world its about what the marketplace will do in a crisis not which market was in a crisis.,3
1616618928,"It really depends on your goals. If you're looking for fast money and a pump and dump, I do not recommend cardano...if you're looking for a longer term hold cardano is a good one.  Keep in mind the max price of cardano will range from 2-5 dollars per coin.",1
1616618486,"Ahh.. great questions. You mention info that it will ""recover."" For that I would suggest you learn about technical analysis as I think that's what you're referencing.  I've been holding cardano for a few years now...since it was 3cents. I highly recommend educating yourself on the project as that will help you decide of you would like to invest. Their website is a great place to start. You should also learn about the creator of cardano as they also created ethereum. Cardano is proof of stake for example and now ethereum is switching to proof of stake... My advice is to hold cardano for long term...it is definitely not a good short term investment.  Check out the r/cardano subreddit. You'll find the community is not about the pump and dump",3
1616618583,"Also...never ever sell at a loss!!!  I bought cardano a few times in 2018 for a dollar or more and watched it crash....I kept holding anyways.  If you do anything I would suggest dollar cost averaging...that's where instead of selling at a loss, you buy more",2
1616619991,Honestly...i would read on reddit as opposed to the dime a dozen schilling articles that are out there.  I also found trading view to be a helpful place to learn. It's got charts and people's opinions on technical analysis  https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/,2
1616620059,You will also learn about rsi indicators on trading view,1
1616631831,"again, they sell in pieces over a few days..  be at bottom of dead cat now, not top tomorrow..",2
1616633800,"I'm no expert, so I'm not sure. If I knew stuff like that then I'd have a lot of money. Nothing I say is guaranteed. Just educated guesses based off past experiences watching cryptos go up and down.  If I had to guess then I'd say .15ish for a while then take off again. For all I know though, everyone just loves ONE so much that it could just keep going. I've seen a lot of shilling for coins though and eventually the honeymoon ends. Then a few weeks later the coin is putting out again and everyone is in love again. Lol. Good luck either way. I hope you guys all end up making the money you need to make your lives even better!!!",2
1616633552,Because it's more than doubled lately and has held strong through BTC dumps. I don't see it just going to the moon because this reddit says so. Stuff needs a while to breathe before it continues to climb.,1
1616804518,"I did. I really did. I didn't do a damn thing different except diversify my coinbase portfolio and leave everything for ETH in Robin Hood right where it was. (yes, I know I use crappy services. I didn't learn better until later, lol.) Now I am almost back to where I started and working on profit. Patience is key and months matter. ❤️❤️❤️",2
1616603473,I like your positive approach. Best of luck to you too bro! 😎,1
1616599791,I trust that to be the case. I just took the unhealthy approach of staring at it ;-),1
1616596060,">Im wondering since everything else is green today but my investment ofc are not xD I recommend you take a look at BTT before it takes off this week. I would recommend STMX too, which has already taken off",1
1616623398,Just stake it and forget about it. Coinbase APY is 6pc and runs indefinitely. Binance stakes have better apy but you have to try to catch the longer staking periods which aren't always available... Just my opinion for Algo....,1
1616566100,Fuck it. I YOLOed in. It isn't really possible to wait for a true dip with THETA because there aren't really any. Best 1-day chart I've ever seen.,2
1616565561,"I mean, it keeps hitting ATH nearly everyday. THETA has the most incredible 1-day chart that I've ever seen!",1
1616588728,"Yes, looks like it will move today",1
1616583724,"Damn, can't buy CRO on Binance, but I hope it goes up for you guys 🙏🙏 I'll stick with my BAT, CHZ and MANA",2
1616618253,"Incorrect. Ada is not finished. Furthermore, please define what you mean by ""finished."" Are you saying it's bull run is over? Or that it's fully decentralized and smart contracts are enabled?",1
1616636480,"I'm going CRO, their mainnet just launched.",2
1616597853,ADA has a huge market cap with it only being slightly over a dollar. They need to burn some of that supply.,5
1616600564,"My ADA just sits there like a bum in the rain looking all depressed. I'm not loosing faith tho, One day soon that bums gunna stand up throw off his tattered rain coat to reveal an Armarni suit and stroll up the road singing in the rain 😆",1
1616622060,Bots?,2
1616594188,Nobody know.. but I think it’ll go up to .25 today,2
1616619362,"Thanks for the response, I am a noob here so just learning best tactics / technical analysis, any advice on where to get reputable info would be great.  I will get over to r/cardano and their website to find out more as I definitely do not know enough!  It is hard to hold when you see the chart going down, I will hold for now and look into dollar cost averaging.",1
1616604184,Cheers!!!😎😎😎,1
1616599841,😄😄😄,1
1616624206,Exactly what I'm saying that automatic 6% a year is better than any savings account,1
1616566893,I bought in at 8.35 in think ..11  ..not a lot  but I wasn’t expecting gains so fast,2
1616618531,"I mean that ADA promised a lot, but it took a long time to fork, and now there are networks like Binance Smart Chain, HECO, DOT or OKEx that have been running for months and with endless Dapps ... for that and for the  Excessive supply is exhausted.  I understand that you are a holder and believed a lot in the project, but like DOGE, everything has its moment and the ADA has already passed",1
1616600695,"I can tell that you have an artistic soul! Ada will eventually follow it's path to glory and bring back the big fat hot sun! Tshirts,shorts, beers and ice cream for everyone!",0
1616594207,.30 by next monday,2
1616619637,"Reputable info is hard to come by... you'll find tons of dime a dozen articles that say buy this coin...don't buy this coin.  My advice..buy a little btc, eth, ltc, ada or binance coin...they've been around a while. Check your investments daily and read about upcoming projects in your spare time. Don't expect to make huge gains in a short period with these coins...but they are a good investment. If you're looking for huge gains social media is your friend. You'll notice enjin  and harmony one have been taking off lately. Whenever you see a coin takeoff like that, read about the project and learn about them.  If you had some spare coin, harmony one might be a good place to buy a little and see what happens",2
1616618832,These are excellent points you mention and are valid points.  Right now I think of cardano like a night club being built in a small town. The nightclub puts out advertisements that it's going to be the best night club the world has ever seen....the town gets excited watching the club get built.. Now the town is lining up outside the doors waiting for the grand opening. You are correct...there are no dapps yet on cardano. I think of the dapps and the developers like the town waiting for the club to open.  Dot is super cool....wish I bought before it spiked.  Harmony one also looks interesting...,1
1616619137,"For this reason, there are so many networks that in the end, you will use the safest one, which is BSC, and due to the excessive supply of ADA it will never go up in price ... from my point of view",1
1616619236,“Safest” I mean that it is backed by Binance which today is the largest platform in the world,1
1616619349,"Man...I very much regret not buying binance coin when it was super cheap.  You also bring another point about overall price of ada. I've been holding since it was pennies so it worked for me... I see the price of ada (pending it holds the 3 spot and can compete with eth) ranging from 2-5 dollars....if one has a fair amount of money to invest, it could bring huge gains. Not so much money I would recommend harmony one...or even binance for that matter.  I kick myself all the time for not buying chainlink when it was cents, and same with binance coin....can now add Theta to that list....sigh...",1
1616619825,"look at the ADA supply, it will never reach that price ... my advice, if you bought in pennies, sell the proportional part to recover your investment and hold the rest, but it will never reach that price you say.  I wish you the best",1
1616620117,You too man! Good chat,2
