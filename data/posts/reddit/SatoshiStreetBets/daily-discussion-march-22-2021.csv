1616454120," I've taught a lot. Our problem is that we have a small budget compared to the big players. We always hope that the courses will reach the next resistance point.  But for the big players 5-10% up is enough. Therefore, they always sell large sums of money before the resistance point is broken. This triggers panic among small investors and thus the price is depressed even further. Then they buy the low price again and everyone thinks that was just a dip. They play this little game 3-4 times until nobody else plays along and the course continues to decline. Now they have 20% more money and can get back on board cheaply. Was such a thought of mine.",3

If the stock drops too low and the risk indicator hits 97% they will sell the stock and take the principal and interest and you'll be left with no stock or money. Also best to not borrow more than 5x your assets if you want to play it safe.,2
