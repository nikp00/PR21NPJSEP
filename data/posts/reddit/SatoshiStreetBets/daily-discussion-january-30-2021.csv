1611984291,"Let's take a moment to talk strategy here. A pump probably isn't coming soon. These mass movements are (unfortunately) very dependent on the Robinhood userbase. And much of the Robinhood userbase is locked out right now because of manipulative bullshit. So when is the pump coming? Four or five days, once most of the locked out Robinhood users can join the fight.  So what's the strategy until then? Hold and promote. There's a thread that keeps getting posted about how short sellers are exploiting the situation: keep blasting that information and keep people motivated. Keep holding. Keep people aware of what is going on with the Dogecoin value and why. Don't just blame paper hands (which implies that we don't have enough dedicated people), show how Robinhood manipulation and short sellers are actively interfering with Doge. If the energy dies before those Robinhood users can re-enter the fight, then we lose. If the energy stays high long enough for them to re-enter, we get the pump we should have seen when the markets closed today. Also, promote alternatives to Robinhood, especially ones where people can get set up in minutes. The most motivated among us will use an alternative to re-enter now. But the large mass of buyers will probably be stuck waiting on Robinhood, and they need us to remind them this is worth staying engaged in.",91
1611968957,If you are panicking about Doggy and then posting about how you are panicking that is literally just the dumbest thing you could do. If your scared that it will go down why the fuck would you be stupid enough to post that and possibly make others scared thus fulfilling your own paper handed fears by making other paper handed pussy sell!

1611972616,Stop posting about timed pumps and ban whoever does,38
1611976590,You guys have to realize that the likelyhood of someone selling rn is much greater than of someone buying because Robinhood is not allowing most people to purchase crypto. As long as you hold it will stay roughly the same. It has nowhere to go but down rn until RH starts honoring people’s buying power. Ya’ll a bunch of pussies for selling just HOLD,35
1611979151,"The problem is that all these soft asses that saw what was happening to GME and were to poor and weak to purchase decided to jump on board with DOGE. They had no balls to buy and hold and went for a quick gain and are excited they made a couple hundred. We got Trojan horsed and let in a bunch of phonies. It hurts right now, but the real mofos that know what’s up will come back and we will get back on track. Enjoy your chump change to all the paper hands that sold out after 12 hours on a small dip.

1611980276,"Just a reminder for everyone watching Doge sink:   A shitton of RobinHood users have been artificially removed from the game. If their money was deposited in the last five days, they can't buy. If they bought Doge with unsettled funds earlier, sell them, then try to jump back in at a dip, they can't buy. I believe (someone correct me if this is incorrect, but it's something that RobinHood did a few weeks ago when Doge was on the rise) that if you sold stock today intending to put it into Doge after the market closed, you're locked out until those funds settle. Point being: keep buying and holding, and keep the energy high. A lot of eager buyers can't make any moves for about five days. Once either their money settles or RobinHood decides to take their finger off the scale, a whole army of buyers can jump in.",34

1611984571,"Doge was under short sellers attack for the whole day with up to x25 leverage or more For the whole day I was watching dogecoin in my scalping orderbook software and I tell you what. With all that hype **fuckin short traders** came to doge market in Futures part of binance and other trading platforms and they short with up to 25x leverage or more. That's the main reason it's stalling. Now, stay with me, because it'll be more and more interesting as you'll read it and deserves attention to show how the same scammers like Melvin Capital are doing it in crypto now. **TLDR** from a fellow doge owner comment: A bunch of a-holes have actually been trying to short doge all day and they're doing essentially what the hedge funds were doing. What do we do with this knowledge/information: If it dips keep buying and hold it (but don't spend more than you can afford to lose completely), because there are no sellers except these scumbags and those they scare to sell with their manipulations. The volume is 5 billions and they're manipulating with a few millions, making another few millions sell and affect the price. This is not a financial advice, just my observations of the today's market. As a scalper I can see how that actually happens. Futures traders trade, some big futures traders manipulate the others by placing huge sell limit orders on Spot market (Futures follow Spot) to spoof everyone to sell and to block the price from rising because they want to make money robbing us. When they bump the price on spot, the futures market follows the spot and they throw 25x leverage (or less) short market orders on futures and drop the price down even more to make money on everyone who was buying up to their wall on spot. This is absolutely the same shit that happened with Gamestop and this Melvin Capital fuckers who thought they can make money on people's savings who've put it in GME stocks. But this time it's our money that we've put into dogecoin and they are trying short sell on our money and put the price down flat. Well, I bet you all know how to make them regret this. These fuckwits are begging for a lesson. Here's a screenshot of resistance level 0.05 that we were stalling below for almost an hour because of this: https://preview.redd.it/ths2ecq7ade61.png?width=1799&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a69d6e24620908baeca1deeb71359ee2b9ad65 Another one at 0.052: https://preview.redd.it/pchb7pk5ade61.png?width=1819&format=png&auto=webp&s=9966291568f5f04a985e1ee4e8edf61428d746c1 They were praying on our money for the whole day. It's not us average Spot account buyers. It's them, making their 1k DOGE into 10k, 20k, 25k and placing it on SELL on every fucking resistance levels. **Another one** Spot with up to 3x leverage available for short sell had 27MILLION DOGE COINS ON SELL at 0.055 and we just blasted it to nothing and didn't fall, I'm proud of you boys: https://preview.redd.it/7cyoai53ade61.png?width=2143&format=png&auto=webp&s=6867efb4dc6b026554d5462c0ec12ee381a845df **37M sell wall limit orders on 0.06 spot market to bump the price down** and throw surprise short orders on the futures to make some money on us: https://preview.redd.it/r0k8it8x9de61.png?width=2138&format=png&auto=webp&s=b562694cdc3c42d2496c410025307b0fdce5d23f Do you really think there are any idiots around to sell 2.220M$ at 0.06 when the price is rising or it's just a bunch of assholes who bought it on 0.045 and placed 760k$ with a 3x leverage at 0.06 to bump the price down and rob some people with market short orders on futures with 25x leverage? Old story same shit, it's done this way: https://preview.redd.it/g6gggzcz9de61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=d02770b217a7174495204d3d85b767b34e1fb167 Futures always follows spot. Spot has 3x leverage. Futures up to 25x. They place a wall on spot, price gonna bump down, they throw 25x short market orders on futures when it happens and rob people. You might ask how to fight this? Simple. You buy. And you hold. The price bumps off first, then comes back and we eat that wall and their short orders on futures suffer big time. They'll eat shit even with stop losses because their stop loss will be processed at higher price or not even processed at all because of lags and then they lose even more. I bet they're using high leverage on their shorts, because they're greedy little shmucks. Here's a video of how these people pushing the buyers up only to remove the order below the local resistance level and short sell on futures with big ass leverage (this is 1-2% per each push on short sells multiplied by leverage they choose): https://reddit.com/link/l88klh/video/bnuhxa162de61/player Then, when the price goes down a couple percent, they put their limit buy order back, throw in long market orders with leverage and rob everyone who was selling atm again. I don't know about you guys, but I'm NOT mildly infuriated, im close to getting big and green and my pants are not stretchy enough. This is fucking disgusting. UPD: Let's see if this classic tech analysis pattern gonna work out or not: https://preview.redd.it/1n9ll90bjde61.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=764b96849192ed85bc55af2fe2fbd58a4a18231a https://preview.redd.it/as54uxmojde61.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab189f0c8f067cf782d888909585868806d7166 UPD2: It's fucking war out there! Huge love to all these people who pumped it back above the trend line but it's still not enough! Don't let it fall below 0.04! https://preview.redd.it/vcwa5cx3ude61.png?width=1603&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0542ad9e90eb417fc2b064571f28b8bf171ecb Also, thank you for all the rewards! I now can acknowledge myself as a true redditor & crypto autist! UPD3: We're still holding around 0.04 with shadows at 0.039, if it goes below - don't sell if you can afford it. If you've sold, the next dip stop for a battle will be around 0.036-0.0352 and we shall watch there if we kick back up hard or not. If we do - there are chances we go to the upper side of the triangle and break it to the 0.059 | 0.068 maximums. NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. Don't put money you can't afford to lose in there. There are trading beasts out there now and they're merciless. https://preview.redd.it/l7dps9s5xde61.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=bec8815658e522d845583dab841076a82cb63031 **UPD4:** Video about how it was dropping from 0.035 to 0.028 and some conclusions of mine. The low volumes of the fall from 0.08 to 0.04 only proves that these were short sellers that used the situation (suspended deposits everywhere) to their advantage to make money on short sell and then buy from those who sold during this dip. **Today was another day when the same sort of people without morale as the Hedge Funds scumbags got even more rich by robbing a lot of good people around the world making a fake drop of the price. It's sad that this post wasn't high enough to warn more people but it is what it is.** Sorry for the bad quality, I don't have enough time to render it and want to sleep hard. I have only 1300 Doge coins but I didn't sell. I understand that those of you who got millions might have sold, but from what I can see now when it pumped back to 0.035, I can tell most of the whales didn't sell and bought some more from those who were selling. https://reddit.com/link/l88klh/video/aj7kbmggbee61/player Hope you didn't sell at the bottom and lose a lot. Hope some of you bought at the bottom of the dip. I'm going to sleep, don't catch on the short assholes manipulations, but it's your money so only you have the right to decide what to do with them. Not some random guys from social networks. Always remember that and look for all the information you can gather.",52

1611976849,The good news about Doge especially after today it's been holding at between .03 and .04. It seems that's the new floor and no longer under a penny. We need to hold and regroup for another run. I say let's wait until sometime next week. If we keep creating new higher floors for Doge we will get it to one dollar and beyond.,23

I've literally put about $200 into something I'm just going to forget about for the next several years. Just thinking about how far dogecoin can actually go is the only inspiration I need. $200 is money I would had spent elsewhere on something with lesser value then buying a cryptocurrency, so I've accounted for my risk level and compared that to my potential gains, and it's not even something I'm going to lose sleep over. Spend $200 today with the potential to make an absurd amount of money in the future? It's a no brainer. 💎 hands baby! To everyone out there, just relax.

If you are a nob, selling in loss and moving on to another coin in 95% will put you in same situation you are in now.   Remember, we are in a bull market.    ALTcoins season have not even started yet.   Most coins will break ATH and go 5x from where they are right now.   Be patient. This isn't over. Let me give you a life example.   I got in to sushi coin 2 months back.    Bought large bag at 1.40 because it was pumping. The next day it retraced and I watched it go down to 90c.    It took a week before it got back up. Longest week ever..   The minute it retraced and went over my buy price I sold. Guess what?   Next week Sushi coin doubled and kept going.   Two months later its at what ?  9 bucks per coin.   Do the math, I had 30K coins and I let it go at break even because I panicked.   Right now I am under water with Doge. But I will not make same mistake again.   You do you.",12

1612008772,"Guys, I had an Idea.Well, in fact, two ideas. # Genetically improved idea I'm (the original author of the post) am researcher in genetic algorithm.The core principle of genetic algorithm is dead simple. Have a stuff, mutate it, reproduce the fittest individuals. My first idea is to express my second idea, and ask you (if you like it) to copy/paste it, and if you have any improvement to make to the idea, or the way it's expressed, do it before reposting it. (Also, keep the first part, but feel free to correct bad English :) ) # Feel free to copy paste and edit this post &#x200B; Now for the useful stuff: If we are the only ones to buy doge, we just wont make any money.   Our focus should be for the world to want to buy Doge. Our target should be Elon Musk, on reddit. Elon Musk would do anything for the internet to like him (also, he's the richest dude ever).    What I propose: find and propagate a twitter hashtag, something like #ElonPleaseBuyDoge (it's shitty, hence the viral bit).",22

Divide doge by 10 now (to account generously for any pre pump) and it still would have been a 400 million odd market cap.  Thats still high.

1611984044,ATTA BOY MOONBOUND,7
1611993035,2k down. . .  does not matter. . .  mooning soon. .  matter of a week or so,10
1612000713,DOGE BACK IN GREEN FOR 24H%,10
1611976014,"I completely agree. He hyped it up, yet ignored it after its most successful day....and tweets about bitcoin instead? What a weasel.",12
1611976890,It’s because robinhood won’t let people use funds that haven’t fully transferred on crypto,15
1611976965,"Bro stop. I’ve lost $20,000. You’re fine. Just keep holding",17
1611976819,Patience.,20
1611976942,Hang in there friend. And hold. You will succeed.,8
1611972178,THIS🙌🏼,11
1611973784,Get your friends! Buy the dip!,12
1611973852,Spam social media when you're dry,9
1611983664,Honestly probably higher. Around this time yesterday we were around .07 and .08 after that run is when everything happened. We probably would have seen a dip after the high held between .06 and .07 and pushes forward.,8
1611984030,We Buy. We Hold and We wait while our Bros get back into pumping when those Shitty Exchanges start to work properly again.,8
1611984749,"Of course they are, those scumbags",9
1611969220,Absolutely.,10
1612008308,What is doge may never die.,16
1611983977,"I did that all day yesterday and the night before, I had so many of my friends dming me on how to buy it and how much they were putting in. Doge is publically supported crypto on par with bitcoin or ethereum. People want to see us succeed and be part of history!",11
1611986176,IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING,10
1611974354,I think we are the 2020 Jaguars,7
1611974688,in other news fuck robinhood,9
1611975762,"If the doge community donated a small fraction each time we profit, we could potentially raise millions of thousands of dollars",6
1611973584,Is that a rocket in your pants? Or are you just hung on DOGE????,8
1611990500,me too let's go baby,7
1611973845,They could have made so much more :( greedy traitors..,7
1611974239,"Yeah, that's honestly accurate. Right now, we need to hold, regroup, and wait for the next run. The good news is that we established a new floor.",7
1611975769,You'd feel dumb once it goes back up,10
1611976246,Hodl my man! I've been hodling since 2014 and so far Doge have been my best investment yet. Your patience will be rewarded.,5

1611971369,But I won’t you know why. Diamond Fucking hands,17
1611986738,"Eurobros need to pump new blood in here. Please keep that link afloat that explains what's going on with the scalpers. EVERYONE NEEDS TO BUY AT DIPS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HOLD. DO NOT SELL",5
1611969306,Ignore the people and their coordinated buy BS. I really think theyre just trying to sow panic.,7
1611983922,I can’t stop laughing at all of this.,5
1611978777,We'll be waiting! HOLD DOGECOIN! Let's get these other buyers in here.,11
1612000611,"While im still on team pump DOGE for now, this is a good point. With our group's buying power and co-ordination, we could pump a smaller market capped coin like crazy all at the same time. Not sure any other coin has the mainstream appeal and meme potential of DOGE tho",9
1611977478,Fuck a coordinated pump. Buy dips hold lines,10
1611979820,That’s not how percentages work lol,3
1611973487,Nobody can buy anywhere besides UPHold,7
1611973501,Bc people keep giving these stupid pump times and when it doesn’t pump ppl freak and sell,7
1611973544,Wait and hold until the platforms get back into it... I havent had any issues but a lot of people are blocked.,6
1611973559,[deleted],4
1611975248,UPHOLD,3
1612000429,Its not over yet! Quit being such a downer 😜,7
1611974361,Ok. I bought at .07 for 20k lol. What’s your point? If you were in it for a quick buck and 24 hour return then gtfo. You obviously don’t understand the movement. Paper hands have no place here,11
1611971436,💎💎💎🙌🏼,5
1611971564,Yesssssirrrrrr!!! 💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌,5
1611984024,Retards will be retards. Hodl strong next pump coming before end of weekend in time for new week,4
1612001203,I agree.  Just bought some doge on a tight stop.  About to move stop to entry and let it run for a bit.  I think I know a potential coin to pump.  It has all the right buzzwords too,3
1611973555,Gotcha. Should I Hold at RH and then buy at UPHold?,7
1611973677,Yes. Cause RH being jackasses with instant transfers.,4
