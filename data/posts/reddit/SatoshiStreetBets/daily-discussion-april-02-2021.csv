1617423628,Go Harmony go!,11
1617474123,Be patient with Harmony One. Binance is finally allowing the Harmony people to withdraw their One and stake on the Harmony site. With the price dropping people will begin buying One but there won't be as much because the supply will be more limited. This will cause the price to shoot up quick ...so be careful if you sell it. You may not be able to get it back at a good price.,11

1617449025,"Tired of hearing about SAFEMOON? It might be time to listen up. **Safemoon is not going anywhere.** I know everyone is tired of hearing about these types of tokens, but Safemoon was **the first** of these and is making historic achievements in the world of crypto. It is the original “safe” token and has achieved so much in only one month since its inception. Believer or not, hear me out. \-This coin has actual **real use**. The roadmap includes the devs’ plans to create a crypto educational app, begin a charity project, integrate safemoon into their own video game, and establish a Safemoon Scholarship. Not to mention, holders are already earning high yield returns directly to their wallets because of the Safemoon tokenomics. \-The CEO has confirmed that crowdfunding for a **Binance Listing** will begin next week. \-Safemoon is being listed on Whitebit This Monday. For reference, HOGE went up 100x after being listed on Whitebit. \-Celebrities such as Lil Yachty, Jake Paul, and Keemstar have already publicly tweeted or endorsed Safemoon \-The devs are all transparent and host an AMA (ask me anything) not once, not twice, but **three times per week.** **-**The amount of holders has increased steadily to over 170,000, the reddit subgroup has 30k members, and the Twitter account is extremely active, bringing in over 40k followers already. \-You are not buying at the peak, we are currently sitting 40% lower from the all time high. **What is Safemoon?** Every time somebody sells Safemoon, a 10% fee is applied to the seller. 5% of this fee gets burned (removed from circulation forever) and the other 5% is distributed to the holders of Safemoon. In simple terms, this coin is beneficial for holders because it pays you out passive income simply for holding the token. **There’s a million tokens like this, what’s so special about Safemoon?** The short answer, the community. The growth of the holders, social media presence, the transparency and communication from the devs, the celebrity attention and growth on all platforms is unrivaled. The Safemoon community has also showcased their commitment in many ways. The community has already raised over $70,000 through crowdfunding in order to initiate the listing of Bitmart and Whitebit. The CEO has also informed the community that next week they will begin crowdfunding for a Binance listing. Why is this important? Currently, the **smallest** token on Binance has a daily volume of 12,000,000 per day (info from coinmarketcap.com). That means that at the minimum, it would be a 3X increase from Safemoon's daily volume. What does that mean for Safemoon? More token distribution to holders at a minimum of 3x more coins to holder’s wallets per day. **You’re still early**   It is very clear that Safemoon is not going anywhere. This coin is the original “Safe” coin and is going to be a trailblazer for the next wave of crypto. Do your own research and take risks you can afford to lose. I'm betting on the growth of Bitcoin, altcoins, and Safemoon and am very invested in it myself because I believe in its growth. If this growth holds true, **Safemoon will skyrocket.** **Conclusion**   **Millionaires will be made from Safemoon.** Truth be told, the only way to make 100x returns in crypto is to **get in early.***.* No one believed in bitcoin when it was $50, no one believed in Gamestop when it was only $.50. You must enter early if you want the true ""moon"". And for all those who are concerned, you are not buying at the peak and you are still very early (the token is only a month old and has a very healthy chart). **Full transparency** \- Yes I am invested in Safemoon but I do not come on here shilling just any coin. I have only ever spoken on reddit about STORMX, which I felt was a strong project with a good team. It went up 800% two weeks after I dropped it in here as a potential high return investment. You can check the dates on my previous posts for confirmation. **Safemoon** is my next call and I am a true believer in it’s growth over the next few weeks, months, and years.

1617492267,"With the ever expanding supply of doge coins (currently 97 billion on the market) the demand can't push the price higher because more coins are always hitting the market, as it is an unlimited number of coins. At least with ONE the coins have a total cap (12.6 billion, 9.6 billion on the market currently) and some percentage of coins are burned with each transaction, limiting (although small) the supply, which will allow for some demand to push the price higher. And considering the staking rewards ONE in my opinion is clearly a better coin for price value. Doge is great for low fee, quick transactions, but not for investing.",2

1617476100,"Just take your time and be smart. Learn how to read the charts. Pay attention to different parabolic moves, flags, W's, and all that bullshit. But more importantly before you put money into a coin look at the patterns of that coin over the past few days and also study that coin to see what it's habits are. I started with $5,000 at the beginning of February and worked my way up to $47,000 by the middle of March. I got stuck a few times on some dips but I just waited them out. That's why you focus on coins that can make you the most money. The MORE a coin costs (like Bitcoin) the LEAST amount of money it will make you.  For example if a coin is .01 cents and it shoots up to .015 thats a 50% increase. Therefore if you put in $1,000 you would turn it into $1,500. Right now on binance.us the coin that can potentially makes you the most money with the smallest amount of movement is vtho (but it moves slow as FUCK).  When you're buying and selling you have to have a plan of how much money you want to make on each sale. Right now vtho .0152. Based on my knowledge of watching vtho over the past couple of months I know that .015 is a very good price because it's been as high as .025 however with the market dipping now I may put in a limit by order of .0147.  If I buy 2 million coins that means that every 1 point that vtho moves I will make $200. Vtho's volume is a little higher than its average so I know that I could probably get two decent trades in a 8-hour period so I would try to make about $1,000 to $1,400 per trade. So once I hit my .0147 limit buy order I would put in a sell order of .0154. I'm being VERY basic and only scraping the surface ...but this is just a simplified example of the amount of time research and detail that has to go into your buy and sell trades.",5

1617454585,Seems like people really been blowing up low market cap coins lately. I’m not a financial advisor but I’d be watching WIN and STMX right now,2
1617465253,Glad to see we have a SUSHI community in here,2
1617473911,Just hold tight. They're allowing all of the people to stake now so when people begin to buy the low price the amount available will be less and the price will shoot up.,5
1617481046,You expect it to go up only? Healthy corrections are needed. If you buy during the run 50-50 you will get left holding when the corrections come. I have been waiting for this dip to load up more. Idk why everyone is crying,2
1617469955,"Keep it together. Cool down and stop buying high, selling low. I know how you feel. Got into crypto in Oktober last year with 15k. I needed some time to learn. Went down to 7 in January and now I'm up to 22k. Could have been 100k or more but i bought high, sold at small dips boght other stuff and so one.",2
1617470894,Guess I bought stuff at bad points. ONE has cost me the most out of anything. Horrible.,2
1617427050,good invest now with the dip ✌️,2
1617433413,"thanks , but i  do not understand why the sathosi moderators help them and post about people who speak nice about elongate!",1
1617442775,Guess I'll keep the hodl thank you,2
1617457110,I loaded up on it. its been consolidation for awhile now,2
1617459447,"Oh yes, lots of room to go!",1
1617459911,👆what this guy said,1
1617467117,"looks good, i'm gonna ask the community",2
1617461868,Why JST?,1
1617478373,"Yep, We don’t talk about this!! IYKYK🙌",2
1617477447,"I’m not selling, only buying mana at its current price. NFA",2
1617489384,"Yes, search for ONE/USDT - ONE/BNB or something",3
1617457554,"Yeah it really was, it’s fixed now. Don’t know how xD",1
1617443926,Nice tactics mate. Imma wait a little bit and see if I'll go full paper handed lol,1
1617455470,God I hope so,1
1617458101,Is it a scam though it seems phishy,1
1617458537,Where do you mine?,1
1617458343,Kraken,2
1617462671,"I didn't know that. I'm still a novice at best with all this stuff. But yeah, DOT seems like a no brainer. Why is it hard to get a spot on Binance? I use Binance primarily, and only got Kraken to stake Dot, because I didn't think you could on Binance for some reason.",1
1617464440,SUSHI!,3
1617465275,💪,1
1617462569,"Lol, I literally just sold my WIN. I was looking at BTT. Any others?",3
1617464298,WIN is where BTT was a 3 weeks ago and it has 1/3 the supply. BTT had tons of FUD too and still pumped!,2
1617462643,What do you think about EarnBet $BET for a pump?,1
1617465230,GRT is underrated 🙄,2
1617473053,Stmx!!!!,3
1617474381,I already sell (before the dump) half of my BTT's to buy some JLS and TRX. Now I think I'm going to hodl the rest... I'm going to take that risk but I don't want to sold all my BTT's for sure (I made the mistake a couple of weeks ago) BTW I love the fact that you're name is solidsnake big fan lmao,2
1617488377,BNB 💎,1
1617404986,Sold chiliz today so it will rise.,6
1617405027,I transferred my whole bag into one and it's gone down lmaoo,2
1617439121,Tru,1
1617445484,same. 💎,2
1617454451,I feel like I’m to late for HOT,1
1617457919,"I got in shortly after you, so very happy",2

1617468574,Saved! Haha hope so,2
1617466444,The level of support is solid af.,3
1617439883,the pump comes from the BINANCE community,1
1617461219,💎,2
1617465097,that tells us what.. 😉🤫,2
1617461730,"Cool , thx",1
1617419302,https://twitter.com/simonyusea/status/1377460736348221440?s=28,1
1617474933,Yup thats right the more people that stake are gonna push this coin up,4
1617470346,True story. This is similar to my experience too. I should have had double of what I had now if not for the same reasons you have highlighted,2
1617470361,"Indeed. We all go through the same motions. Two tips that I live by: 1) only spend what you can stomach to lose, and 2) never sell at a loss. It almost always bounces back at some point. Just do your research, buy projects you believe. And sure, everyone likes to gamble a bit. But see point 1. You’ll be fine mate✊",1
1617471361,"I feel you , divide your money into different coins...try these coins .....WINk , ANKR , MBL , BTT , NPXS( PUNDIX) ...just put $100 into each ONLY if you can spare and HOLD....7 to 10 days...(NFA) good luck ....😀😀😀",3
1617471765,I got one too bro. Its gonna rebound. I got it around 15 and 17 and been watching since 3 cents. Just got to hold one. Its a sleeper then pumps up.,1
1617472386,"Well, I am in the same boat. Just looked into Binance and nearly got a heart attack... Not funny.",1
1617427098,Ahhh thank you,1
1617436246,Majority are bots,2
1617457862,Hope so!,1
1617462192,🚀 trade challenge on BINANCE until the 16th,1
1617478645,"I'm buying every dip in Mana, it's a great project and still super undervalued",3
1617489806,Got it,2
1617458376,Since i don't need to spend anything cos it's free so i just keep mining it through the apps daily...lol,1
1617458788,Pi network on playstore,1
1617458432,Thx,2
1617465283,☝️,1
1617465305,Yessss the SUSHI community runs strong in.,1
1617465254,and JST,2
1617462895,Dent,1
1617465225,"Also, TRX is the company who invested in both BTT and WINk so they are a safe bet as well. Seem to know the crypto market well",1
1617475237,Btt jst and all this shitcoins are for fast money. U better invest ur gains in UNI. THETA. ENJIN ETH BTC BNB thos are real Projects. I make fast money on shitcoins and invest it in UNIswap. Uniswap in summer 200-300$,2
1617474922,"I made the same mistake with my BTT, took out my inicial investment and kept half in... couple days later it went up 4x ^^ Bought Sushi with half my BTT now and I will HODL my Portfolio how it is now.. i Wonder if we can make a huge push again as a community !!! HOOMANS STRONG TOGETHER !!! (I am honored, MGS is also huge for me :)! )",1
1617488837,"Yeah BNB is a safe investment but I'm jumping on the SAFEMOON train, you never know :)",0
1617408242,Thanks,2
1617405967,ONEs been pissin me off the past few days,6
1617454860,then ONE 🙏,1
1617463567,"Too late? There's a lot of money in hot...and not many people. A month ago, there were only 14k global holders. There's obviously a lot more now, but look how much talk it gets on this sub. It's still basically non-existant. Go for it.",1
1617458016,Well done....,3
1617466517,🎟️😅,3
1617439974,So we're genuinely going places with this? Contest or not?,1
1617461872,JST 📈,1
1617422465,I'm hoping this is gonna give Stmx a huge boost,2
1617473879,Exactly. Slow and steady wins the race boys! And here and there you get lucky. Even more rewarding that way👌🏻,1
1617471537,A few of those just got pumped. I can't even buy those anyway. I only use CBP and Binance.us.,1
1617459436,I had wink actually and stmx and put it in harmony,2
1617479689,"Completely agree, should be higher!",3
1617458739,How much do you currently have and how long have you been mining,1
1617458675,You bet.,2
1617467014,"Nice! Just threw some $ at JST, danke schön",2
1617463626,Cool. Even after this run? You really think?,2
1617466356,Oh and forgot to mention April and may are best months for crypto!,2
1617478918,Thx for the tips mate. Will consider this 👆,1
1617489160,✌️,1
1617490337,You need bnb smart for pancake swap to convert it to safemoon. Make sure to adjust slippage to 11% or it won't go through.,1
1617406128,Yeah...same here but it'll shoot up after I sell it 🤣🤷‍♂️,1
1617455044,WIN! The name of the coin says it all,2
1617464131,Might throw some in HOT but also throwing a lot of eggs in on WIN basket atm.,1
1617458593,"Not too shabby yourself, kind sir. We are both WINners",2
1617442620, till tomorrow pumping hard 😁🤫,1
1617463114,"What do you think , how much  will go up?",1
1617429301,"Or a big dump if everybody already bought. You know, buy rumors sell the news.",1
1617472078,Ok...always DYOR ....and for (ONE)...it will get back into shape again very soon....all coins will have it's upwards  run like in a circulation mode...you'll see in time during this bull run season...good luck...(NFA),1
1617458966,Over 229 in less than 3 months,1
1617467522,✌️,2
1617463849,"Charts show small dips with upward trends in the long run, plus it's still at an affordable price point for all. Market cap is reasonable and there's an actual project behind it, will likely increase but at a steady rate",3
1617407482,Can you please sell so it can shoot up,6
1617434952,"You just got PRANKED, HA GOTEM",1
1617457862,How do you guys know its getting dumped tmr??,1
