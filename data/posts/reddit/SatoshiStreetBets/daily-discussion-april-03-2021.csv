Now, pretty much two weeks later it's 5x and this doesn't even look like the peak yet. I'm probably not going to invest now because I know the minute I do it will probably tank. Plus, I'm having a hard time getting over the $5k I missed out on from not investing. My question is why is it going up so much? Surely with all that supply it shouldn't be rocketing like that.

1617562718,It looks like for a few months and those staking have to lock their WIN / TRON / ETC. for the whole time to get the rewards so there will be less selling in the near future as the coins are locked up.  After the lock up the rewards are released in waves.  This was a good idea to prevent dumps and to keep people invested.

1617563625,"Looks like these last staking rounds might end  June 7, 2021 20:59 (SGT)  but people will be still staked and it will slowly be released.  I would think they would have more rounds if this is successful.  It already looks to be having success.",2
1617564105,One recent thing I like about BTT is they create the BitTorrent File System which is a file storage option which is getting a boom right now due to Grayscale buying into Filecoin and that skyrocketing: [https://www.bittorrent.com/token/bittorrent-file-system/](https://www.bittorrent.com/token/bittorrent-file-system/) This kinda went under the radar but with Filecoin now going crazy people are trying to get in on the next wave of low buy ins.,4
1617563536,That's a hard one.  Probably WIN and then BTT just because of buy in.  I have mine spread out among all to be honest.  Hoping we get some decent returns.,1
1617507193,"Yes, WIN and BTT are going up again 🚀🚀🚀",1
1617514762,I don't know what that means! Could you elaborate?,1
1617513005,good stuff. I feel like im late and didnt put enough haha,1
1617512787,I actually had it .00049 but sold it to get into something else. Luckily I was able to buy it back on the dip today,2
1617513640,How could anyone sleep when you can literally watch yourself making money,2
1617521437,Just sold actually started to drop,1
1617526448,You are right.. I also put my profit to WIN. It will not stopping.,1

1617535033,Translate 🤣,1
1617547852,💪,1
1617546885,I guess so. They sure are determined to pumping it. Guess that's the power of telegram/discord groups. So powerful. Might as well join them before it's too late,1
1617495978,Big same up 1k on $150 that i felt pretty stupid spending lol,3
1617527693,"No, in the last 16 hours I've made over 4k on it. Today, its been up and down around 10 percent in a very predictable fashion. Most of the others have been very slow to respond since the little dip around 16 hours ago. It was most certainly being manipulated, three quite quick pumps followed by some medium dumps (which then trickled down as paper handed day traders panicked). I did quite well on each of the changes. Gotta watch for those signals. As for down all day, crypto is a long game not a two hour window.",3

1617540438,thanks,1
1617505324,Haha now that’s a real one 👌🏾. I just cashed out my initial investment as well. I refuse to get hoged again. I believe in this coin but I know people will dump when the listing goes live.,1
1617504621,Also check out TOKO on Kucoin,1
1617519166,Think it'll go higher?,2
1617518517,"Oh yeah, what's it about",1
1617536213,Buy TRX or BTT,2
1617533279,So if you gain a lot of money from crypto market it's safe to put all on those coins?,1
1617536624,"Cant help you there sorry. Im not sure what caused that pump. Ogn is a great project though with  alot of rumoured announcements in the next two weeks, perhaps some news regarding one of these announcements was leaked somewhere? Its a mid cap gem. Doesnt take much money to move it, cant see how it wont hit a 1bil market cap soon giving a token price $5. With the team,tech and tokenomics $100 long term is possible imo",3
