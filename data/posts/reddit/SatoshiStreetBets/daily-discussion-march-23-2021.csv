1616503219,"PUNDI X As previously announced, the token redenomination will commence at 14:00 GMT+8 on March 30, 2021. Based on community‚Äôs response, we‚Äôve chosen PUNDIX as the token ticker of the new token after the token reduction. We think this strengthens the Pundi X brand and it‚Äôs easily recognized by people and exchanges. You can swap 1,000 NPXS tokens for 1 PUNDIX token. There is no change in the value of the new tokens a user holds after token redenomination compared to the total value of the old tokens. There are three ways to swap your NPXS for PUNDIX. Manual on-chain swap at the Pundi X official site Who: ERC20 compatible blockchain wallet holders How: Connect your private wallet to the Pundi X official swap site which will be available after March 30 on https://www.pundix.com. When: Anytime from March 30, 2021 to March 29, 2022. The holders decide. Result: Receive PUNDIX after the swap. The speed of receiving new tokens will depend on the traffic condition of the Ethereum network at the time. Advantages: Holders can keep PUNDIX in their private wallets and participate in the upcoming DeFi staking in April. Holders can also choose their preferred time to swap or trade NPXS or PUNDIX. Disadvantage: Need to pay ETH gas fee. 2. Auto swap in the XWallet Who: XWallet holders How: The process is automatic. Holders don‚Äôt need to do anything. When: March 30, 2021. Deposit and withdrawal will be suspended 24 hours before the swap. Result: Every 1,000 NPXS will become 1 PUNDIX automatically. Advantages: It‚Äôs automatic and there is no gas fee. Disadvantage: To participate in the decentralized staking, holders need to withdraw their PUNDIX tokens to their private wallets. 3. Auto swap in the supporting exchanges Who: Wallet holders on participating exchanges. How: The process is automatic. Holders don‚Äôt need to do anything. When: Depends on the exchange‚Äôs timeline. Please refer to the announcement from the exchanges. Result: Every 1,000 NPXS will become 1 PUNDIX automatically. Advantages: It‚Äôs automatic and no need to pay gas fee. Holders can trade PUNDIX immediately in the exchanges after the swap. Disadvantage: To participate in the decentralized staking, holders need to withdraw the PUNDIX tokens to their private wallets. *PLEASE DO NOT SEND YOUR TOKENS TO ANY ADDRESSES OR OUR CONTRACT ADDRESSES TO SWAP BECAUSE YOUR TOKEN CANNOT BE RETURNED.",3

1616504180,"PundiX (NPXS) surges 130% in two days: What's driving the rally? NPXS has rallied 130% in just two days after PundiX CEO confirmed staking and token reduction. NPXS, the native token of PundiX, a cryptocurrency point of sale (PoS) solution provider, has seen a massive surge in price over the past 48 hours. In merely two days, the price of NPXS rose by more than 130% on Binance, outperforming most major cryptocurrencies on the exchange. There are three key reasons behind the rally: the launch of token staking, token reduction, and the overall positive sentiment around the altcoin market. Token staking and fewer NPXS tokens On March 13, Zac Cheah, the CEO of PundiX, reaffirmed that token reduction and staking for NPXS is happening later this month. When the supply of a token is reduced, it immediately acts as a catalyst because it typically pushes up the price if demand remains the same. PundiX is reducing its token supply to a 1000:1 ratio and rebranding the native token from NPXS to PUNDIX. The rebranding is fueling the overall increase in interest in NPXS, considering that the token has been consolidating for a prolonged period. Additionally, token staking further amplifies the positive effect on the value as it leads more users to stake NPXS and refrain from selling as the token is locked up. Cheah said: ""As scheduled, $npxs token reduction starts late March, followed by (immediately or few days later) token staking. Staking reward is USD100,000 + value weekly for ten weeks. Someone said it's better to call our staking 'DeFi farming', so yea Pundi X DeFi farming is comin!"" As Cointelegraph previously reported, many cryptocurrencies saw a large rally in recent months after introducing staking. For instance, Theta Network introduced staking for the THETA token, which coincided with the price of the token hitting a new all-time high on Feb. 14. Traders are anticipating more ""alt season"" The altcoins market is seeing significant rallies almost across the board as Bitcoin price is currently consolidating between $56,000 and $59,000. What's more, the altcoin market's capitalization has reached a new all-time high of almost $730 billion, or roughly 50% higher than in 2017. A pseudonymous trader known as ""Rekt Capital"" said that explained that this is a perfect example of market cyclicality, alluding that the overall trend remains highly bullish. He wrote: ""Altcoin Market Cap launched into new All Time Highs from the very same level that launched Altcoin Market Cap into new December 2017 All Time Highs. A perfect example of market cyclicality if there ever was one."" Other notable rallies in altcoins include Harmony (ONE), Siacoin (SC), Terra (LUNA), and BitTorrent (BTT), which all surged from 40% to 140% in the last 24 hours. Finally, the market sentiment around PundiX has been generally positive after its testnet launch on Feb. 11, as Cointelegraph reported. Additionally, VORTECS‚Ñ¢ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for NPXS on March 20. The VORTECS‚Ñ¢ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements, and Twitter activity. The VORTECS‚Ñ¢ score for NPXS flipped from yellow to green a few hours before the price rallied on March 20 from around $0.006 to as high as $0.0082, or roughly by 30%. As long as the altcoin market rally continues and Bitcoin consolidates above the $55,000 support area, the positive market structure of NPXS should remain intact.",1
