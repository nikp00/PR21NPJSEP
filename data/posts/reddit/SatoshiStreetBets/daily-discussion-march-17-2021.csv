1616022584,"To those that foresee the  advent of ADA on Coinbase as the event that will break the hitherto unbreached supra-2$ mark for ADA I will remind them that Ada Lovelace had a difficult, frustrating  and tragic life. That 70M  sell wall  the market has been trying to cross for months now was erected by a secret group of ADA whales from within IOHK as a testament to her troubled journey through life. The team behind its construction refer to it as the ""Wall of Tears"" an epithet whose appropriateness  can be attested to by any that have attempted to scale its  dizzying heights.  Today it  looks down on the ravening hordes that Coinbase will soon unleash, chuckles softly and in a low raspy whisper says ""Bring it!"" Etched at the wall's base is a barely legible, blood-spattered inscription in Old Norse that, loosely translated, reads  ""I am created Kraxos, shatterer of Bullish dreams, bringer of crimson rain, gaze upon my unassailable might and tremble"" (Just in case you missed it, the ""Bullish dreams"" mentioned are a double entendre referring both to, any silly aspirational Bullish trends you might harbor, and the gold Bull on black field that adorns the crest of house Lamborghini, while the ""Crimson Rain"" alludes both to the inevitable blood letting that must ensue as well as the torrent of crimson candles that has followed every campaign to take her lofty  summit). An epic battle is about to be joined, and despite the spectre of defeat looming large, my banner flies with the invading force. May the saints preserve our Tether and the gods see fit to grant us this long prophesied victory. Once more unto the breach dear friends, Once more!

1615975940,The trick of daytrading bitcoin is not to trade bitcoin itself. Find some altcoin that is tracing the moves with more volatile action. For instance right now MANA almost plays like a 5x leveraged bitcoin fund. ETH is often 2x. By trading bigger moves you take less risk and pay less fees and can multiply your capital faster.,5

1616025262,"Xlm yesterday now intigraded with iTrustcapital for Roth IRA and 401k. Cardano has a meeting with African government to finalize a big contract for using Ada network. Xlm and Aave creators will also be at the meeting. Remember Xlm deals with wire transferring making it thousands of times faster per transaction for cross boarder payments and just payments in general. Send Xlm to your Coinbase cold wallet and see, then try ethereum or bitcoin and you’ll see the difference in speed and transaction coasts. USDC stable coin partnered with Xlm. so stable coins are backed by 1$:1 USDC coin no, fluctions in price. No volatility. Aave is your decentralized finance system. So you don’t need a bank! You earn apy intrest and can lend crypto out with one another. Also remember cardano Ada had their people live in Africa for 2 years figuring out how to bank the unbanked.

1615984240,"Just for fun, in the middle of 'corrections' that start to take more and more the shape of the 'corrections' of 2018. HOOOGE HOOOLD. Well, as of right now it is dying back to its level of some weeks ago, at light speed. I watched it to see what good could be found on Uniswap, and in fact there are all projects like that.  Basically, someone sold at market price Hoge, the price was divided by some thousands, close to 0, but just a bit over 0. Someone else panicks, and sell at market price, and again, it goes close to 0.  Why? Because the market was sustained by bots before. And now, it is going to go down to an absolute 0.0. The bots have securities and are the HFT bots, so they can react faster than any humans. They put buy/sell orders to manipulate the market up or down, and sell coins/tokens, so, many orders are in fact from bots to keep the price at a certain level. When someone in a high liquidity coin sells, they can absorb a little bit, price goes down a bit, but they still can keep with it. In a no-liquidity like Hoge, they just remove all their buy orders, and the price crashes, selling only to individuals that had orders in the book, not to the bots. Impressive, right ? People are very interested in coins like Hoge etc... They have an amazing potential of growth, according to them, up to 10000000000% Well, that's a market order for one of them. Hoge: It lose 99.999999999% of its value in a second, just because someone for sure placed a 'market' order. Combined with bots that sustain the sales/buys at fixed prices: [https://whitebit.com/trade/HOGE\_USDT](https://whitebit.com/trade/HOGE_USDT) The charts are bogus, they show 'up', they show 'down', they show 'big profit', because they are bot arranged. If anyone tries to sell at market price, there is not enough liquidity to sell, so it travels all the way through 0 ( yes 0 !!!! here, well not 0, but something like 0.0000000005). Note the wick of the poor guy that sold at 'market'. And the bots, that avoided spending any money, but are just here to keep the price artificially at a level, that reappear the second after to keep it at the preprogrammed price. Lesson learned, big gains on a computer screen does not mean real FIAT will ever exist to pay for them.",0

1615985352,"And, as I always said, but people don't want to listen.  Most people say 'put your money in XXX or Hoge so it will go to the moon'. That is absolutely bullshit. When you 'put money in DOGE' or 'put money in HOGE or 'ADA', and HODL... You help your predecessor to have FIAT money against their coins, so they are very, very happy.  But the money you put DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE.  For your coin/token to have value, you need to find or hope for someone, in the future, who pass to you more money than what you just 'invested', otherwise your coin/token is worth 0.0$",-3

This is a lot more than Theta did last year though, and don’t forget the large Tier 1 Tournaments coming in 2021 for verasity. Theta with its huge marketcap could not even achieve 200k views on their tournament last year, while we did 8.6 million last year. This reiterates that they are non - competitors. Our competition is not crypto projects. Our competition is non crypto companies which is why we are the first truly hybrid company catering to both but with unique PoV blockchain tech. We will follow this path to growth and the rest will follow as day follows night. Our partners include Tencent Athena and Warmania.

1615990834,"Just sold all my BAT I was holding since November (big bag!). Shed a little tear but 1,25 USD was just too good not to let her go. I'm sorry love, I'll get you back sometime....",2
1615994421,Care to link that comment.  Because I can't seem to locate this anywhere officially.,2
1616002439,That’s a big ass supply,1
1616004081,"There is a meme floating around of a ""before and after crypto"" picture of the Microstrategy  CEO that's really funny.",1
1616004305,"It’s an interesting one, last week SKL and MATIC both listed on Coinbase Pro on the Thursday and initially there wasn’t any real movement, however around 16 hours after that they were then launched on normal Coinbase and this is when they both spiked. SKL went from .61 to 1.24.  I’ll be waiting with my ADA to see if the Coinbase effect will be the same. It’s worth noting that ADA is much more well established and has a lot more resistance in front of it, on the last big push it struggled to break 1.50 before falling back.  My guess is anything between 1.50-2$ but hey it’s crypto and could go anywhere including down 😂",5
1616003918,"I think after the main Coinbase listing (after the Pro listing) it will hit a peak at $2, then settle somewhere in the $1.50 area.",1
1616009955,that we will see tomorrow!,1
1616010753, yesterday i made a stupid mistake and sold CHZ to buy ADA. That was NOT smart!!! but it was going down and down and i got stupid panic!,1
1616012111,Would should could lmao,1
1616012133,I bet there is a good chunk of people on CBP looking at ADA yesterday and today who can't wait for tomorrow morning.,1
1616014849,can't even deposit right now stimmys got em bogged down,1
1616014338,I put an order and it didnt fill . now it went 20 percent higher,1
1616017817,The wallet you have connected to Uniswap.,1
1616030468,I don’t see these two happening separately this bull run... I think everything is just gonna go nuts at once lol,2
1616032523,I feel that gaming platforms would rather make their own coin than adopt a new and share profits. They've got the money to do it. &#x200B; Edit: They also wouldn't want a universal coin because people taking profits to their competitors would be a problem.,1
1616008156,"The price didn't triple since any point this morning, how did that happen?",14
1615960949,Where can you purchase wozx?,1
1615956152,Buy low. This will be around for a while with plenty of gains to be had,2
1615961167,website or whitepaper or anything on this?  should at least be some colorful images to stimulate my brain.,1
1615971906, what time is it at your place?,1
1616003080,"So I checked their website, wanted to see, since they're a fully pay as you go provider with no monthly costs, what the rates were per call, per min, per text, per GB. None of it.  None of it listed there that I can see.  Not even a bit of it wrongly listed.  Just, not, listed. So, hard no.",1
1616005328,"Yep! Nice profit sofar and still going strong. Will probably pump for another couple of days. Easy money if you ask me, just don’t push it too far. 10-20x and move on.",2
1616022774,is it in dip rn,1
1615948062,Well it’s too early to say it wont happen,1
1615952443,Probably. You got FD7 ventures that just invested 250million in Ada. Ada is also now on bloomberg terminal. And on the 18-19 the African government deal is being finalized and they will talk more about it there. Also the creators of Aave and stellar will be at the African conference. Soooo yes this shit is gonna pump LOL,5
1616011516,Good point. She has a lot more than I have,2
1615955374,"You mean ""oh dawg!"" right?",3
1616000137,Looks promising Pretty low cap still,3
1616001034,Wouldnt that be nice!!!! I'm holding till 1$ anyway. Or 0.99 to be honest.,5
1616008760,Also a great Mexican rock group from Guadalajara,3
1616015548,I imagine it levels out at some point today and then explodes tomorrow after the listing,3
1615947456,It's just eth via Uniswap atm,2
1615945594,I just threw 1000$ at it 🥴,8
1616000906,It is long term of course but it dropped so quickly that i feel like even coin burning won't be enough to hit 300$ resistance.,2
1615994207,45 mins until ADA goes live on coinbase pro?,2
1616020673,"Damn, I guess at .03c it is worth a shot. Payday this week means I’m gonna throw some on it. Good luck with it sir hope that pays off 100X",3
1615961442,That would be Nice. More buyers,3
1615974596,"Apes everywhere 😂💩 but thanks, feel bad for you but also a little better for myself.",3
1615975735,👌🏻 hope for a good risé!!,4
1615985382,"I hope so, people keep on saying its a ""shit coin"" but i like the project and the partners they have i mean barca and madrid, isnt it crazy",3
1616027975,Was coinbase recently confirmed? Been holding ADA for a while now,2
1616027373,its pretty high rn so skeptical to buy but hearing a lot,1
1615959282,"You must be Sheilas other account. Meet me at the back of 4 square at 6pm for a 1 out, bring your mouth guard.",3
1615956277,It will. Same as HOGE. Not much can sustain that fast of growth without a bunch of sell offs. Holders should buy more and it will go back up.,2
1615950951,Was nice to grab some more HOGE on this dip.,3
1615951023,bro are you a bot,3
1615997778,I mean it’s crypto so anything is possible. Market cap fairly low. Everything I’ve learned is it’s a long hold. But for being ranked #3 out of hundreds. Has me about to throw big into it.,3
1615998618,"if we can hold it over 1.48$, the next step will be on 1,78 $",2
1616012853,And me some new cars 😂😂,3
1616018525,ENJ party is friday night..  let it settle another day or 2 before re-accumulating..,3
1616002583,Did you buy at the ATH,2
1616002641,Volume is back over 20 mil,2
1615948529,Both of us 😉😉,1
1615949358,exactly..  depends how much time u have in front of screen..,4
1615949732,Super cool 😎,1
1615993447,why do you say that,1
1616001908,Yeah not a pump and dump and not dead but I can see why you’d think that.  Skepticism is a bitch.,1
1615985364,Are you a moonboy? I'm laughing at people wanting to buy coins that mooned already,-1
1615962241,"Thanks for the investment suggestion. I was searching for a good crypto coin for investment, I will use Monero for it.",2
1615960539,Lol hope ur right,1
1615970981,"Are you sure, bought before bed at 0.88159 and now its 0.81964 :(",2
1615976738,Thinking matic or harmony,3
1615980556,Its decided just not commited (people still only dipping toes) needs to come down a bit more in general for everyone to buy back in,1
1615978203,"200 on bitcoin, 100 on Harmony",2
1615980391,Yes get one but wait for 60s again its about to get listed on binance futures tomorrow (people would prob bet down short-term and up long term) it needs a healthy correction and i will buy if it does. Edit : 70 isnt bad price or 80 but will wait longer to be in profit,2
1615979409,And your chance of double or tripling your money is way better with ONE. with mana it would be extreme to double its price.,2
1615987011,Thanks...It's  20 mana😅😅😅,2
1615991845,Do you have room on your boat so we can cry together?,1
1615994579,Grayscale just opened a trust I think you may have some regrets,1
1615994971,"I saw it yesterday, I can find it today. Been looking for an hour.",1
1616003552,[deleted],1
1616005918,So the listing tomorrow is only on coinbase pro and not normal coinbase. Did i understand this right ?,1
1616006183,"....or a total inversion of the chart since crypto started, all compressed into a 2 hour timescale.... ☠️",1
1616011195,it will pay out. however it looks like you sold when it was down!,1

1616067276,"HBTC, Bithumb, Gate.io",1
1616003743,I know. But that does not count. It's Altcoins season. Look at MITH on GitHub. Nothing new since 3 years. But performs well. 85%+ in 7 days. Or Dogecoin. Development dead since years. Recently booming. 😉,1
1616004192,"Check out my website: www.cryptocim.net Take a look at my coinmarketcap watchlist, which I share. There you can see my selected coins. Very good profit since end February.",1

1616023638,yes,1
1616001235,I conquer sir!,3
1615947661,It marks error :( you know what might be happening?,1
1616000989,we will see,2
1616020704,hang loose big dogg,2
1615974963,when stupidity strikes! one can only learn from mistakes!,3
1616036077,Yes released to or already full release tomorrow,2
1616027397,i have a small amount but thinking about getting more if all this hype is true,4
1615959886, wtf? if ur not an idiot you would actually take note of what sheila is saying.,1
1615950981,For sure. Party hasn’t even started yet,3

1615993511,The pump and dump scheme is over.,-1
1615985455,That was my attempted self-deprecating humor. We're all moonboys at heart.,5
1615974666,"If you want a quick gamble head to a casino. When a product is down in the chart, it's time to buy. If it dips to even half that, you bought too early, but it doesn't matter, your value is still there waiting for it to rise. But if you panic and pull out (which is what everyone here is wailing about) you increase the drop, and are not in for the rise. BTC  didn't get to where it is With out lows and highs ... But No one who pulled out when it was down made money. Those who held through the dips did. In fact those who bought more in those dips did very very well. See the charts, see how they look like stairs ? Up up up, down a bit, then up up up, then down a bit... very few have gone down down down and stayed there. Hence the war cry HODL !  Learn to do hold, buy in the dips, and you'll do well.",2
1615980668,Either is a good choice. Best to split money in 2 and drop the bags every few hour's or days in 25% increments to get best dca,1
1615992058,"Just had a boating accident, lost al my coins.... All five coins listed by Greyscale exploded. MANA will be back at ATH in no time and LINK has the biggest green candle of its career.",1
1615994821,That was the reason I was selling!!! It always peaks with such an announcement. Don’t forget to take some profits every now and then. I’ve got my eyes on other coins for the next few months. BAT served me well and it was time to say goodbye,1
1615995035,I'm wondering if you're thinking of the skynet fork and all that stuff.,1
1616004073,Yeah.  Do you know like how many tardi gets burned a day. Like hoge of the hoge report to show that.,1
1616006228,Yes that’s right initially. Last week though the announcement for SKL and MATIC only mentioned Coinbase Pro but they both sneaked on to normal Coinbase quietly a few hours later so it might happen with ADA too. I think the biggest uplift will be seen once it’s on normal Coinbase,1
1616011384,">it will pay out. however it looks like you sold when it was down! 0,49😪😭",1
1616032224,Lol maybe 500 into bigger coins 250 into smaller coins with some purpose then 250 for complete degenerate behavior .... also the sub .01 thing means nothing without looking at the market cap lol,2
1615947765,"I find slippage has to be 5%, I use Metamask and just connect it to the uniswap page. Possibly try closing and reopening your wallet, it should go through",3
1615949404,Slippage 5% and don’t hit “max” subtract the gas fee from ETH balance so it has sufficient funds,3
1616029425,I would definitely buy with simulas checks and it being listed into coinbase pro why wouldn’t you. I see this going easy 2.10 or 2.20. Look at what happened when polka dot got listed on coinbase pro then two days later listed on reg coinbase and rose 3 dollars,2
1615995039,Personally I shaved of my initial buy and left the profits to grow that’s how I do alts then I don’t get sick when they tank i can’t figure out the charts and what I think are great projects can take forever to catch a wave,1
1615995171,Might be.,1
1615949433,"Got it, this was the problem thanks!",1
1615995410,"Good strategy. For me it’s all about stacking BTC with alt profits, the BATBTC rate was good for me so I exited. Calculating in btc gives a slightly different strategy compared to measuring in USD. I hope BAT goes to the moon, but I’m moving on to some smaller caps.",1
1615996608,I made some mistakes earlier moving back into Bitcoin and buying back in at a higher price and eating profits but I learn a lot quicker when it costs me money,1
