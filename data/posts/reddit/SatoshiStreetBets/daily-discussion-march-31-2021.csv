1617233476,Harmony ONE chart looking hella bullish for the weekend,14
1617236445,"Good dip to load up on ONE, nows the time if you missed out on the last blast off💥🚀 don’t miss this one",11
1617237492,ONE and SLT if you haven't already.,11
1617241547,Man should of listened to the people who promoted harmony one in the beginning. Its a solid coin. Wont be surprised it hits 1.00 by the end of the year,9
1617240388,Bepro only just beginning to take off...,7
1617242465,"Over $3M of BEPRO purchased in 24hrs, in the process of being listed on Binance (one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world), and I just DOUBLED DOWN. The price will 🚀. Keep those 💎",7
1617237385,Viva la BEPRO,6
1617251790,"Edit: Talking about Stellar (XLM) Been following this subreddit for a while and ended up joining Reddit to post since I haven’t really seen many posts on this coin here (please correct me if I’m wrong). Also yay, first actual Reddit post! (4chan with a condom, etc) Mostly just wanted to point out a lot of the positive press it’s been getting in recent weeks, lots of institutional attention and recently bumped up to #3 on the Coinbase popularity list, as well as longer hold times (20 days) beating out the hold times on the platform of Chainlink, Uniswap, Filecoin, and Cardano even though these coins have mooned already. I figure that’s a good sign in terms of future volatility and speculation, and as far as the coverage goes it basically just needs a boost in attention to make more headway. Seems like a shot to $1 would be realistic if not likely already, and at that point it could easily jump to $3 or $4 if hype is sustained like some of the above coins have already seen. The biggest drawback seems like the SEC case with XRP (as if diamond hands give much of a fuck about that) since they’re related, with the saving grace being that Stellar doesn’t sell their coins and just gives them away, so they have an edge if they’re under the microscope at some point in the future. They decoupled their price from XRP after the latter got slapped, so it can thankfully grow independently now. On the plus side, they’re solving actual problems with the financial system while also supporting the crypto space and integration with the existing system in place. I can see how some would say that makes them sellouts, but I feel like projects like this will help us transition into expanded crypto use across the board since they emphasize crypto conversions and transfers that help other projects. Plus, cheap, fast, and enough supply that they have the ability to have wide distribution over time (and are easier to inflate quickly). They are also more compliant than most coins with the regulation side, too, and even though they might be a “safe” (lol) bet here it would be an interesting change of pace for the subreddit to get behind it or something similar. Also spoiler: I do hold Stellar and am long on it already since the 2018 bear market, wouldn’t suggest it if I didn’t believe in it, already made a nice profit, but might as well be transparent about my position. TLDR; free money please, lol u tk him 2 da bar|?",6

1617308373,"Bro, I don’t know what you are thinking but harmony did. a 4x last week. I’m very bullish on it (since 2cents in dollar value) but I took partial profits around 340 sats (ca 20ct) cause I’m quite sure it will need to test the support on 200 sats for an organic growth. If you bought in recently/above 300 sats...there was just no entry and you need more patience. I’m very glad it’s not running right now...and I got big money with it already",0

1617287995,"This sub should be used for low cap coins so I’m ok with obscure coins, but the fact that elongate, literally a community begging Elon to acknowledge them, won moonshot Monday is pretty disheartening.

1617291789,The mining is much fairer as you can do it on a simple laptop and you mine more the more hardware space you have. The whole concept is a great idea. I don't think we've seen the top of filecoin yet.,1
1617288403,I felt the same way last month but it’s crazy how fast it can turn around. I was down -20% overall for weeks and now I’m pushing overall 100% in a matter of three weeks. There’s still a lot of good projects for a medium term hold out there that have a lot of room to go up,2

1617260369,What is he saying now? I agree. This will be huge,2
1617296167,What is cup n handle formation ?,1
1617289894,Luckily the sloppy copy/paste and bad formatting give most away.,3
1617291246,I agree it’s not really revolutionary or exciting price wise but it’s a somewhat unique idea with a decent team so I can classify it as separate from the shitcoins,1
1617295036,"Coval is solid, fact that you can swap/trade NFT for NFT is going to be huge and fact that you can tokenize bundles or pairs of different coins as one is also very interesting",1
1617259076,Fil to 1000$,3
1617259214,Its already at 221,3
1617259357,This is huge,2

1617299047,"No bro, I’m saying that it’s a steal to get it right now because this will easily be $1+ soon. Even though it’s tripled I still think it has way more potential bud",1
1617307602,So no one can blame the dump on Americans this time,1
1617240630,April 1st is a matter of location.,1
1617281772,"Your still early it only has a 500 million market cap, I mean if crap like doge coin has like a 6 billion market cap I'm sure we can atleast get 10x returns from here considering it has a real use case with a working product and team behind it.",2
1617279530,"It's a game maker kinda like minecraft where you can build  you own worlds, nfts assets etc and rent them out sell them using the sand token you can buy and sell ingame land with sand too. https://gamemaker.sandbox.game/#/en/a",1
1617269598,true,1
1617293107,I wouldn’t invest more today just wait for it to settle depending on your goals are personaly I pick a couple of coins and put 20  if they 2x I take twenty out and they coin is now I’m profit and move on to the next coin. I now have a little of everything and build up on the coins that are more successful I believe you should have 1/2 portfolio in Bitcoin,1
1617298890,"But that competition ended in March I believe , not April ? Or was there another one ?",1
1617254652,STMX had enough retracing,1
1617251649,ETH. UNI THETA BNB,3

1617295811,How much BTT u holding ? I got a nice bag too,2
1617308282,It moves!!!,2
1617295304,"Set price milestones for each coin and constantly update them. DYOR, luckily we are in a day and age where information & data is easily accessible. Follow the the tech analysis guys on YouTube to help you identify your coins price milestones in the short term, interim & long term. It’s what i do for what it’s worth. When a coin hits a milestone I consider taking principal and or some profits and let the rest ride until next price milestone.",2
1617283867,10% is 10% 😁,1

1617269621,"get BTT, on cup n handle formation again...",2
1617267058,"I was thinking about UOS Ultra, they’ve got 70%+ even though some are locked up, it’s never a good information.",1

1617295881,350k btt,3
1617296963,"Oh nice! Just don’t forget to watch other coins as well, some coins might shoot up faster, and sometimes it’s good to play with other coins to get some quick profits and put em into your main coins!",1

1617297200,"That’s awesome man! Just keep accumulating as much as you can. It’ll pay off big overtime. And one thing I do is add a bunch of coins to my watchlist and study the charts as much as possible. My biggest piece of advice is be careful investing on the weekend, because everything pumps hard haha",2
1617262302,Not taking anything out yet. When did this hype start and why?,1
1617297228,"Thanks bro ! Didn’t know about the weekend lol ,",2
1617297274,"For sure my man! I learned that the hard way haha. I think it has to do with the stock market being closed, so everyone comes to crypto and the volume just goes insane",1
