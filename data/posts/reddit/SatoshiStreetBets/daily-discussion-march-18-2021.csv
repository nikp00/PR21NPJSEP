1616034469,ALGo Steadily going up today👀,14
1616033004,[deleted],10
1616059706,The 1.50 sell wall for ADA is down from $41M to $26M overnight on Binance. Looking more positive for a break through that milestone later on with the Coinbase Pro launch. Keep in mind that it may be added to normal Coinbase fairly quickly after and that will probably give a second spike. Could end up between $1.50-$2 in the next 24 hours,10
1616060201,ADA flying. This will be huge by 9am,9

1616107987,"It’s funny when you think about the psychology of trading. If you think the fundamentals for ADA vastly improved with the Coinbase Pro launch. And yet the mentality at 4:00pm saw a brief and sudden drop, which caused the whole market to run worried ever since. Yet the fundamentals of this crypto coin has just strengthened, with a new set of investors able to purchase ADA. Essentially this market drop of 20% is a psychological shockwave that will be reversed as soon as there’s the slightest bullish movement. Are we starting to see that now following the new low of the day?...",5
1616109524,"A quick thought on ADA:  Cardano is an AWESOME  project. However it is a truly shitty ""Mooncoin"" due to its bottomless Marketcap and some truly legendary sell walls (some suspect that these Sisyphean Sell walls were erected and maintained from within IOHK as a project safeguard). These are the hard truths that all ADA HODLers are eventually forced to come to terms with. Most came for the Moonshine but only a small number stay for the project's stellar roadmap,  visionary use cases and superior underpinning technology.  Thoughts?",5

1616081325,Just a quick one if you’ve got the time and patience (and let’s face it we all stare at tickers anyway)  If you want to feel a bit safer on Binance with the ADA Coinbase run up then manually use the Stop limit as a trailing stop and follow the price up to protect your gains so that if a big dump comes at a certain price you will still come out nicely.

The new token they are going to use to compete with projects 20x their marketcap, through easier NFT creation, Dapp compatibility etc. A negative seems that their community isn't very active, but this might change.

1616085059,It will go up again. No worries. Buy the dip!,3
1616086687,"I would say ADA is not the right coin for pumps. It has a long vision and a lot of very good people working on it. In the long run it will go up and maybe sometimes lead the crypto-world. buy and hold, but dont play with it. ;)",3

1616110062,"I agree, and I have done very very well. But I don't day trade, I buy and hold, add more in the dips. I treat it like regular shares, set a target, and an exit strategy (always long term never pump and dump). When people say buy buy buy a certain asset, it means dump is not far away. But that dump is almost always quick and short term then we hit a new floor if the asset is a good asset with basis to it beyond a ponzi pile.  Stellar roadmap as you call it is the only thing that matters on the staircase to heaven ... and it IS a staircase in the charts for a good asset.",3

1616075522,Only time I seen something like this was when I accidentally joined a WSB pump on PPT coin - What exchange is it on?,2
1616088900,No fuck you sir.  That was selling for chump change right there.,2
1616074949,"👏👏👏 Exactly this. But also ENJ.  Short/Medium term - NPXS, VET, ONE, AUDIO, CHZ But please DYOR",4
1616075178,Litecoin's a weird one though. Def long term to a degree but it just has like waves when you look at the overview. It doesn't seem to really be a long term growth like ADA or VET,2
1616077082,"Use TradingView. If you want to see multiple exchanges in one view, add them to your Watchlist or overlay the charts.",2
1616080714,I thought binance was illegal?,2

1616106034,I had a good day at the casino. put in my limit sell at 1.498 and the order was filled and then it tanked at 1.50. It was obvious if anyone ever cares to look at the volume in the order book.,2
1616045919,"I’d initially go into ADA; Leave it there until like 11:30am CST today (3/18/21), Pull it out, then toss it into ONE, VET, BTC, RVN, ETH, CHZ, ENJ... Any of those you can’t lose right now.",3

1616059568,01,1
1616058521,I mean fireprotocol the actual coin. At around 1.38 I believe,1
1616059578,and that's my concern XLM will slowly increase but a lot of other coins are doing so much better right now,1
1616065935,"O that late, alright hope my other positions rise a bit so i can flip them into cardano. Remember that this is the first big us exchange ada is on.",2
1616064250,I saw it at 1.6 the other day and was very tempted to take a long position on it,1

1616090925,"Monero is an open-source crypto coin, it is being improved by great teams. Become a member of our community and spread the word about it.",1
1616084685,Let’s see what happens..I am thinking $1.60 aswell Ada to the mooon 🚀🚀,1
1616090703,That privacy feature in XMR coin is quite useful. I don't want others to see my transactions in cryptocurrency. I will definitely invest in XMR coin for it.,1
1616091239,I am investing hard in XMR project. It will skyrocket in price soon when people will recognize the XMR crypto coin.,1
1616092155,I was using trading view for the stocks didn’t know they have the crypto,2

1616031206,100 into #U22 and you're laughing,2
1616075677,LINA? On Bitmax and Binance. I think one other too. This is weird.,2
1616075729,Binance,2
1616075015,I got in on ENJ at .59 and sold most when I hit 2x 😭😭😭,3
1616080793,Depends on your jurisdiction I guess. I haven't run into any legal problems. For US citizens there was/is binance US,2
1616115129,I reckon you're close bit I'd pit two weeks on it.,2
1616066334,ADA then CHZ and ENJ 🤓,2
1616046995,"I'd agree with ADA however if you pull it out you're just a kid and will never see high gains. It WILL dip either jist before or after the 2 dollar Mark, then it will go up again after the little kids have finished fainting over the ten bucks they made.",1
1616046608,🤗,1
1616056472,"Hard to say, it's not really dipping just bubbling ... knowing the locals here i would say it should dip a little more before it goes up simoly because it's not going up much right now and the locals see that as a sign of armageddon and bail thinking they are going down like the titanic ... but it's really sort of just sitting there waiting for 9 Pacific time I believe. Then we will see a pump, then everyone will bail, then it's a good time to buy again.  If you look at the chart, any time is good to buy, even if it goes down, it resolves itself and comes back up. So if you jist need fiddy bucks tonight buy now, refresh every ten seconds and hope for the best. If you want to make proper gains, buy, hold through dips (and buy more) and see where you are at in a month ... you'll most likely be significantly up.",2
1616060205,It’s Already at .06,1

1616060893,r/whoosh,1
1616060107,In trading u should never love or hate a coin otherwise one generally gets burned,1
1616070051,"Yes they all dip, then go up again. America wakes up, it goes down, America goes to bed it goes up again. Biden needs to run a campaign on how to hodl and make real gains instead of running scared on a 5 point pump.",3
1616070529,"Yes, 1 USD is stretching it a bit. Social media volume is already up threefold, trading volume not yet.",2

1616089831,"Monero is doing great in gains this year too like last year. It was the coin with the highest gains last year. invest in Monero, it is the best investment option of this year.",1
1616091556,Monero community is doing inspiring work. I will purchase Monero and suggest people to use it.,1

1616075066,"It will still 10X from here in the long-term. Probably more, honestly.",3
1616047532,"I don’t trust ADA as much as other coins, but it is an interesting opportunity currently to make a little more cheddar to add to that $100 the post referenced, then go into a coin I think a little more highly of. To each their own though!",5
1616056693,"You never know, seems like ADA is going to be more stable than other coins out there, Im going to buy more now and even if it dips #hodl",2
