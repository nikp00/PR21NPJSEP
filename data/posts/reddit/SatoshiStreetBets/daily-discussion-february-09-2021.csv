1612898098,"I don't understand where the opinions on this chat come from. I'm out of the DOGE game but today looks very similar to this past week. Two days ago it stalled at .05, then hit .08+ yesterday. If the new floor is .07, then that's excellent news for the coin.  Like I said, I'm not in the DOGEarmy, but I expect it to hit .09 in a day or two simply based on past data and huge publicity. If you expect to make 30 - 40% profit everyday simply by hodling, then you're gonna have a bad time.",11

1612905317,"Have a look at Bittorrent🏴‍☠️ Bittorrent Speed- Bittorrent speed allows users to pay to be prioritized and speed up downloads. Users can make money by seeding files. The more you seed the more BTT you receive. BTFS (Bittorrent file system)- Make money by sharing extra hard drive space. As long as you have a constant internet connection, your extra hard drive space will be used as server storage space for online services. You can make a nice monthly return. Staking- There are services that allow you to stake BTT. This means they will hold your BTT and provide you with a return, kind of like interest. Poloniex and Dlive are some of the platforms that provide BTT staking. Dlive- Dlive is a decentralized streaming platform. Pretty much twitch but it runs on the BTT blockchain. Users can tip content creators with BTT. You can become a content creator to earn more BTT or you can stake your BTT there to receive more BTT. to the moon🏴‍☠️🐕🔝💎",5

1612903676,"Some BTT use cases🏴‍☠️ Bittorrent Speed- Bittorrent speed allows users to pay to be prioritized and speed up downloads. Users can make money by seeding files. The more you seed the more BTT you receive. BTFS (Bittorrent file system)- Make money by sharing extra hard drive space. As long as you have a constant internet connection, your extra hard drive space will be used as server storage space for online services. You can make a nice monthly return. Staking- There are services that allow you to stake BTT. This means they will hold your BTT and provide you with a return, kind of like interest. Poloniex and Dlive are some of the platforms that provide BTT staking. Dlive- Dlive is a decentralized streaming platform. Pretty much twitch but it runs on the BTT blockchain. Users can tip content creators with BTT. You can become a content creator to earn more BTT or you can stake your BTT there to receive more BTT. Join r/bittorrenttoken",3

1612868642,Why BTT is better than Dogecoin?  &#x200B; 1. You can not Mine BTT but you can Mine a lot of Dogecoins everyday its a black whole Dogecoin and Elon and Snoop are Joke with you guys. 2. BTT has a Real user case and Doge hast only a MEME Joke? Its like you say Monopoly Money is real Money and you will buy a Tesle with Monopoly Dollar :D 3. BTT is to speed up or watching Streaming with fair paymend for creators you can watch later with BTT Movies system like Spotify you pay with BTT for Wachting Movies and more 4. My English is shitting like 1. Class boy :D,6

1612866905,"Honestly Binance has a ton of coins.  It also has cheap trading rates that get cheaper if you have some BNB (Binance) coin in reserve.   I think it's like 0.1% and half that if holding some BNB.  As far as drawbacks, it does not seem to be available in all US states.  People seem to be complaining about getting the account verified but I don't remember to much problems.  I think I downloaded a phone app took pictures of my license and was good to go.  That was like a year ago so I guess it has gotten  more complicated or at least it takes longer.  Anyway I really like Binance for day trading my savings away!",2

1612892669,You can use [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) and use that chart. Use trend lines and all that to follow the candles to help you estimate a good time to sell and buy. With crypto it's so hard to be 100% accurate so don't get too pissed off if you sold a bit too early. As long as you gain you should be good. There's lots of good videos out there on YouTube showing you how to use [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com). The desktop version is the best instead of phone but I still use the app for easy access. Still helpful. It takes practice but you'll get your own strategy in no time.,3
