As volume increase, the amount burned increases logarithmically, eventually leading to an exponential decrease in supply. Each transaction automatically rewards holders and increases the token's price floor through liquidity locks. All without staking. Currently only around 23mill market cap. Still has potential to grow big. I’d recommend throwing a small amount in. I’m in on hoge and I’m in on rocketbunny!",2

1615837736,"The Prime Minister holds a solid majority, so I am assuming it will pass. But who cares, while India pins their hopes on a central currency, the rest of the world continues mining. Sets a bad precedent but India's 1.4 Billion $ worth of crypto will get eaten up if/when it gets sold.  Anyone got a different opinion?",2
1615847821,"Hey, dude/dudette no hate necessary. You came, you stated you case without hyperbole and that's all you can do. Thanks  and Good luck.",2

1615788894,Whitebit need to do KYC before purchase?,2
1615805125,"Basically. This is literally what happened with ALICE just now, while I ate. And immediately after, the rest of my coins just followed bitcoin like lost puppies. Portfolio --> 💩 HODLING, though. You see, I have these hands. And they seem to be diamond 😆",2
1615805782,"let them sell, buy more for you 😂",2
1615813130,Meh so what. Think about it in longer terms... sure maybe it would be better if you bought in at the lowest point but thats just not possible if you're not a whale.,2
1615824220,This year? More like in a month or two,3
1615788505,Same 🤦‍♂️,3

1615781422,$1 sounding like it’ll come a lot sooner than we expect,2
1615792528,Negative. Only the arm will do sir.,2

1615780745,"Well its something beyond 2, that we can confirm.  I thought it was done @ 2.20 range.  I'd eat my tongue, but well, I already have today.",4
1615781563,Gotta have a shit coin in your arsenal,5
1615781630,Ill be hodling and buying with you,2

1615843678,Man Bao Finance Roadmap is so nice. Just great projects which will come soon 🎊,3
1615798632,"Stupid me. While typing this, it hit 44 for a few seconds. A lot of people probably had still orders at that point. It went right back down to 35.",2
1615798799,I don't mind holding for a few if it could potentially hit 80. I was expecting like 50-60. 🤔 Hmmm... what a quandary.,2
1615801106,Such stupidity. Paper-handed mfs.,6
1615862655,🥰🥰🥰😙😙 Viva la crypto revolution!!!!!!!,2
1615821092,"Lmfao. Bruh. You obviously didn't understand. It ok tho. Im not saying buy btc. At all. And if BEPRO  is at 0.02 then its not a random $ass coin is it? I'm saying if we stoo pushing coins that are .000000000000000000001 and push coins that are at .00001<  it will make those coins more like ltc eth and back sooner than later.. if you wanna wait 20 fckin yrs for your coins to hit $1 or even 10$ that lame. We have millions of people buying into crypto, and as far as I know its not regulated like stocks. We can literally make whatever 1 cent coin the next btc or the next 5. Not trying to be an ass just letting you know you didn't comprehend mate. Edit: I fck a sentence in the middle oh well watching gme so did it ina hurry ahahahaha",2
1615817612,"Plus there’s a bsc bridge launching this week, along with their own NFT marketplace.",2
1615774266,I tried signing up but ilthere was a list of countries whrre it said it had no support. Would i be able to link a US bank account?,1
1615774857,Can you swap hoge to xlm by any chance on there? Xlm has great potential.,1
1615776574,"so, right now, mana is better than ada, enj is better than bnb, and hbar is better than matic",1
1615786138,"Disagree, buy One now while it's dipped and buy more enj as well. Gordon gecko would be ashamed at you.",2
1615794082,"Spam? It’s called info about a coin with potential. No worries if you don’t want to buy in, just letting people know. In the long run even with a small investment it has potential to make some good money just like hoge. Hoge market cap already up to 800million plus. I’m more that happy with my investment in both coins.",1
1615798352,I moved it as eth to metamask then used uniswap to switch it to hoge. Now on my metamask. I can only see what's left of the eth and I don't see my hoge coin,1
1615804771,You mean 90$ ?,2
1615812298,Hodl,1
1615816360,And mix it up with some HOGE and ENJ,2
1615819108,"I have some left, went in at 23 and will wait until 7 or 8 pm German time. Most coins usually once more go up at this time. At least I have the feelings that's it like this. I will sell than. Although I set a stop loss at 17. If it goes lower, than I will buy back in.",2
1615818875,Sell? Hold?,1
1615823999,Just hope it doesn’t take 3 weeks like last time,2
1615832724,yeah you prolly right lol,1
1615829561,that´s the 10000$ question!,1
1615844899,Grabbed 6k this morning at .1600 don't see anyone ever mention it.,2
1615835264,thank u!,1
1615835575,"sorry, but i cant find the point ""assets""?",1
1615836070,"sorry, but i cant find it, too.",1
1615841454,Just now !,1
1615837807,This could put back India by 10-20 years. That's very very bad. I hope they don't pass it. Even if they do.. i think people get like 6 months to square off their positions,1
1615842354,"If it is anything like our Government, then as long as the powers that be make sure to kick the 10% up to the big guy, it could quietly go away.",1

1615793728,"That gives me confidence I got in on launch and it went crazy I almost fomo, but I’m here again to stay, I’m farming to with BNB and CHR 🤲🏾💎",2
1615817892,"Hey man, better than selling at 5 cents amirite? Welcome to the hodl.",2
1615785277,For sure!  Love the staking.  Good luck to you  in the future.,2
1615824953,See you on Andromeda,4
1615775413,Binance.US,3
1615781601,😂 aight fair enough,4
1615801780,good for us 🙏 💎👐,3
1615821395,Lol bro those coins can never hit 1 cent.... market caps man,2
1615821434,Gotcha. Still it's a good convo to have publicly so others who are new can adapt and pivot in a quicker manner,2
1615775157,Yeah you can. You need to sell it though for like USDT/BTC/ETH etc. and then just buy XLM with that,1
1615777095,"so whichever 1 of the pair is ahead tonight, you should swap out for the other tomorrow",1
1615798589,"Nwbermind, it still says it's pending on uniswap but co firmed in my metamask wallet. So hopefully it shows up lol",1
1615824839,Sure about that buy back?,2
1615824062,"Yeah, I can't comment on ETA's for response times.  I was thankful that I got authorized pretty quick everywhere except Voyager.  They just don't want my money apparently",2
1615843505,Ya I really think both will do great this year. Would love to see LTC hit that 1/4 BIT mark. Don’t understand why it’s slept on so much,2
1615846196,"It's the ones people don't mention that aren't shitcoins and have more stability. While everyone else was blowing their load on hoge yesterday, I doubled on ONE.",2
1615838183,"I agree that it totally sucks and wish it would fail. I just don't see it as a huge blow to the global crypto market. If it passes, I wonder if people set up in lucrative mining operations will leave India for countries who embrace crypto.",2
1615848598,"OR   they could just  HODL until their government comes to its senses. Buy a Ledger/Trezor transfer to Blu-chip Cryptos (BTC,ETH), Good long-term projects (ADA,DOT,ONE) or Stablecoin (USDT,TUSD,BUSD) and Just FHODL (that's F-ing HODL just in case your wondering).",1
1615802461,If bitcoin drops everything drops LOL .sometimes you gotta have some bitcoin in your portfolio cuz a small correction to bitcoin does almost double to the alt coins which is just so dumb LOL.,3
1615775672,"So i can sell hoge, make transactions amd withdraw from the US, i just cant link my bank accoun correct? Do you have a link to a tutorial on how to use from the US? Thanks man",1
1615798744,You might also need to add the token I don't know if its on standard. Check out the doge website,2
1615775886,"Correct. The only catch is theres a daily withdrawal limit which is 2BTC but thats like a lot  already LOL. Also I dont have a video I just learned it myself. You can probably just deposit a litte bit of crypto and play around with the app to see how it works before you start sending a lot, thats what I did.",1
1615798801,"Bongo, I just added the token url and it showed up! Thanks! I'm new with uniswap so I appreciate the help!",1
1615776038,Yeah that sounds like a good idea. Ive been stuck not being able to swap any hoge to anything useful or with real value. I used uniswap app to swap eth to hoge but cant do it the other way around. Not that i want to cash out. I just need to have a plan for when i want to get rid of some you know.,1
