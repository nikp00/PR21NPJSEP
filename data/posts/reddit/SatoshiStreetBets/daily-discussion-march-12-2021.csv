1615515017,"HOGE has so far been the wildest ride I've jumped on. I out in 175 bucks last night, I'm up to nearly 600. Everytime a whale sells, coins are burned and coins are given to holders, the supply decreases with every sell, the value just goes up... My HOGE balance keeps going up and my HOGE keeps getting more valuable",16

1615513368,"Are these auto-defi, anti inflation coins that require no staking, just holding the next big thing/fad for crypto? HOGE has the best marketing, growth and community by a country mile. I have noticed, however many new coins with similar attributes (Chow, Safemoon etc) seem to be popping up. Whether they are are newer or older than HOGE or are stupid ideas I don’t know because I’m an idiot but I’m definitely seeing them more atm on my own radar. Am I stupid for thinking HOGE, as the most recognised, well advertised and celebrated (with the best community 😘) of this type of these popular new Defi coins is undervalued at this price at a mere fraction of a US cent? I’m also very bullish on SafeMoon as it’s much earlier, and as it is on BSC network cheaper too. I would to hear what other people are thinking, or expansion/criticism on the topic of which I am currently thinking!  ...I am peanut brain but they are becoming more common and making me money in the meantime...",5

1615534726,"People lost huge and fed the whales with XEM apparently. Its value was divided by 2 in only 5 days, an impressive performance, that was to be expected when we know the XEM story a couple years ago, as NEM... When it was NEM/XEM it has a very.... shady reputation. As soon as the price was high and the airdrop was announced it went up a little bit, then some internal whales dumped a few dozen BTC a day and were selling without any price consideration. Reminds me of ADA too, NEM was said to have fantastic 'tokenomics' and 'future', with an estimated future price of 7 to 8$$$ Well, as again and always, the cryptoanalystfreaks were wrong! Anyway, no one can contradict them, maybe in a week it is worth 50000US, so you can never prove them wrong. It goes down they call that a 'correction' before 'the target price'. It goes up, they say, on the way to the 'target price'. Anyway, they are always right! The max was 85 BTC of XEM sold in 10 minutes, but the total sold per day exceeded, in BTC/XEM, over 500BTC. I guess the devs have cashed in enough. The problem behind XEM/NEM is that it has, like ADA, no 'true real use', only hopes and senseless, delusional 'projects' to fuel up speculation.",3

1615555337,"XEM is very impressive I have to say, it goes down truly fast. Might be the concept of the 'inverted pump'",3
1615556865,ADA dip,3
1615558031,I think STMX is the next big play. It’s market cap is really low and it’s listed on voyager making it easy for people to get into I think if it caught some traction it could go between $.25-$1.00. It’s currently at $.0119 and has a supply of 10b. They also have some big partnerships. I feel like it’s a good buy.,3

1615566917,How much more do you guys think HOGE can keep pumping before massive sell offs? It’s been climbing several thousand percents,3

1615572324,Damn I saw HOGE dip and then ricochet,3
1615580762,Soooo I’m someone that lost a bunch in the 2018 crypto craze and have PTSD and so more recently been fucking around with stocks and options and done decently well.

Is there a lot of pump n dump happening?,3
1615581128,So this isn't financial advice but this is why I got into Hoge. I like that with every transaction there is a coin burn and redistribution to holders. I find this to be an interesting concept long term because even now with all the buy and sell transactions you're still making money through just acquiring coins and them going up in value over time. So there is a scarcity by design which will be interesting to see down the road.,3

I remember when it had its previous ATH of 1.17 couple years ago. Everyone said the same when it was crashing to 1, 0,5 0,05...

1615570572,"you have to have a MetaMask account and a Binance Smart Chain account (these can both be extensions for your browser - firefox/chrome/brave are recommended). Then once you have set up your MetaMask account you need to go to settings and create a new network for BNB as MetaMask runs on the Ethereum blockchain. There are guides on this (look up BNB metamask google). Then you need to set up your Binance Speed Chain account because you have to use that to transfer your BNB from your exchange to the Speedchain and then from the Speedchain to the MetaMask. Once this is done, go to the [Safemoon.xyz](https://Safemoon.xyz) site and click buy and it will take you to Pancake Exchange - click the bunny logo in the top right and connect your Metamask account and you can use your transferred BNB from your Speedchain account to MetaMask to buy the SAFEMOON. One important thing to adjust is the slipping or whatever, thsi is done in the swap box settings - its the far right bubble - I changed it to 11% and then to make everything that much harder, you need to have a wallet set up in your Metamask that is for SAFEMOON - go to CoinMarketCap for this - again, google that part its not the worst to do - but do it before you buy (cant guarantee safety).

1615580506,"they already burned 570billiononly 430billion coins left   50% were burned from the get go, and 70billion have been burned due to 1% transactions.",2
1615580615,Over 500 billion already burned tho,2
1615576606,Thanks!,2
1615588137, get your money out and leave the profit in,2
1615599876,"I think so, Harmony ONE seems to be doing its own thing regardless of how BTC acts",2
1615588441,I jumped on it twice since sunday..put all the gains in ADA ✌️,2
1615541559,"Maybe it's coincidence,  but it has been following the same pattern as exactly a month ago when it ramped up to 245... or I am just going insane from staring at bouncing numbers for the past 5 months.",1
1615564851,"Use xlm to xfer funds next time, then convert on the other exchange, lowers the cost to like 5p or 10 c (for you yanks)",2
1615579278,💪,2
1615579116,Yeah i feel like some people dont see the real picture. I wouldnt even waste my time if i didnt know im making thousands from this. Wait till the bkex listing too. Ohh massive gains here we come!,2
1615528554,Nice. Makes sense. Thank you for your reply. I appreciate it. 👍,3
1615532128,Why 2022?,1
1615543307,We will see,1
1615552367,absolutely. but it will happen ✌️,1
1615552382,💎👐,1
1616870381,yes 1 to 1 ratio. hope you got your xym,2
1615625196,yes,1
1615582333,Lol I will wait until CNBC then run.,1
1615592328,"Totally understandable, I usually watch what you talk about and you have been spot on with many alts. Which lead me to my curiosity. I bought ADA and RVN to go long, really like those projects but feel there are many projects that don't make sense to me, doge would be a prime example, I try to stay away from them for investment purposes.  I don't use a bot as you do, I am too amateur to use a bot anyways. If I could pry, do you hold any ETH, I love the project and the developers but feel the gas prices are so high it is difficult to invest in for long term if I compare it to say BTC, whose fees are also high but being the prolific coin in the news gives great returns over time.",1
1615591387,"sorry, on 19.2.2021!",1
1615525532,"Lol no influencers, youtubers, listings, celebrities, exposure, no Elon Musk tweets, and it’s up 3600% on the week based off of a good community. How is that NOT organic",6
1615530783,Orgasmic loads of HOGe pumping and dumping so hard by subs.,1
1615533784,"Seriously, this sub barely noticed it 2 days ago. Before that it was mostly all the community and HOGE posts here and there. I'd say most of the growth was organic.   Now that it has hype and support of this sub, with new listings I believe it is only gonna go upwards.",1
1615532865,Kalium app,1
1615575977,"Cheers mate, same here!",1
1615582379,What do i think,1
1615581608,So you’re saying I can make a shit ton in a short amount of time? Sweet,4
1615584341,you know the answer. hype is 'bout quick success. they all wanna be rich quickly. the whales are buying cheap now and the smart once hoddle. guess you sit on some coins yourself 😉 good for you and me and the others.. 🤗,1
1615589283,I out spending all my profit From ada 🤑🤑🤑,1
1615516015,I'm on coinbase too.  I'll have to look closer. Do I need to do anything?,4
1615522646,"Yeah I put in more today. Going to sleep on it but thinking of adding some more tomorrow, feel like these true moonshots don’t come around often",3
1615516260,Not sure. Haven't tried selling it and don't plan on it anytime soon. I presume it can be done though. lol,2
1615600038,"You’re very right. It’s interesting to see. However, I did notice ADA was doing the the same about 2 weeks ago. That’s the only reason I questioned it. It seem like all crypto eventually follows BTC at some point. I just bought 40k of ONE. So we’ll see! 🤞",2
1615600132,CRLR is also looking good btw,2
1615541997,You're only insane if you're wrong!,2
1615532729,"By this time next year, it will be over $1 and I’ll have a few million and I’m not sure what’s I’ll do. I’ll hold some, but I’ll probably pull some as well",2
1615543566,they are also good projects,1
1615625544,"I hope you don’t mind the questions. Am I calculating this correctly? If I currently have 2997 XEM. Will I then have 2997 XYM? Currently XYM is valued at $1.26 USD. That calculates to $3,776 USD? That is up about 10,800%.",1
1615593180,"ok, Ill give you a big reply shortly..  i have company",2
1615536578,Until everyone wants to get profits. Then it's gonna fall. Good for anyone that got on it. But hold on when the greed kicks in. See what happens if it hits binance.,1

1615533198,Thanks,1
1615581745,Apparently you’re only allowed to make money long term lol short term doesn’t count,2
1615581687,"Vice versa though. As you said, you do you. If you like the coin then you like the coin",0
1615516062,I didn't. It just adds a few every couple minutes,4
1615522696,Agreed. Tomorrow is payday and stimmy this weekend. Debating on how much more I’m throwing In,2
1615521558,Can’t you just do the opposite of how you got it? Swap it back to ETH?,2
1615600131,"Yeah that’s true, I personally believe some of these coins we’ll eventually outdo BTC and then we’ll never worry about its bubble haha. Good luck with the investment btw! You’ll see some nice gains in the coming weeks",1
1615600168,"I’m actually gonna invest in that one as well, I think both Harmony and CRLR are gonna do wonders",2
1615542532,"I like your attitude... if I am right, it will drop back down to about 200 around this time tomorrow.",1
1615533145,Sent.  You can obtain more using folding (https://bananominer.com/).    If you're short on Potassium you can visit the Banano sub,1
1615581894,Apparently dude. Shame on me. I think I’ll take my shame and 8x initial investment and ponder my life decisions.,2
1615517502,"Yup, story checks out. Just sitting here watching my bag grow all on it's own...",5
1615522968,"Goddamn I’m just getting in fella’s, you think I’m early ??👉🥺👈",2
1615533922,this \^\^,1
1615600169,Looking forward to it!!,1
1615601155,Agreed! Polygon (MATIC) is on my radar too. Their project definitely has a place in the future.,1
1615583343,Yup you are a fool. Should have put your initial investment in an ETF and try to earn 7% yearly lol,2
1615523116,"This thing ain’t slowing down anytime soon. We haven’t even started. No major listings yet. No media attention. No influencer attention yet. People are barely even hearing about it unless they’re looking for it. Once the masses hear, flood gates will open. Just my opinion",5
1615523445,Yes. I think I’m going to keep feeding it until it’s listed on a major exchange and then sit back and watch it take off more. Then take a huge payday and let the rest ride.,3
1615524078,"Good points, thanks man.",2
1615524103,Thanks for your input man,2
