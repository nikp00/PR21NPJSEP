Instead of 2 minutes, I had to wait 12+ hours to even get a reaction from the system of Binance: it failed. Yet my money was transfered... I thought 'hey maybe I didn't put the name of Binance as receiver', so I did a second one for 10€ today. Now with Binance as the receiver's name. Well, safe to say the problem isn't me and this one is going the same direction as my first one: failed but money transferred. Problem is I'm getting zero help (after making a ticket almost 24 hours ago). It's incredibly frustrating to see your money go and have zero support when the fault is theirs. I feel like talking to a wall right now. Imagine if I did this with much more money. And that's my biggest concern: how you want to become a stable market when things like that can happen and it takes ages to get support for it. As explained, I did everything asked, so the fault is not with me. I even checked with a second soon to be failed deposit I currently lost....",1

They put me on highest priority for a senior staff member but I have been waiting for a week and no one attend the chat. I'm very disappointed with Binance because it's such a big institution but holding customer's deposit without giving any reason.

1616198540,Ada seems like a good enough investment right now.,1
1616199454,"There are so many of these apps, I want to hear some advice too",1

1616415037,I think it returns on the next day. Did you get yours back then?,1
1616449167,I've done this a couple of times  other times it took about 3 days for the coin to go into my spot wallet. Once it automatically changed to a flexible savings instead.  I think when you fo to redeem the coin early it states what date the coins will be released.,1
1616252477,"Honestly their customer service is to cry about. Amazing how people get screwed over and you get a chat box that isn't a chat box, but just a box with FAQ. You can leave you're computer open for 10 days and you'd probably still not receive an answer... Thank you Binance, if I was new to crypto, I'd probably would have said 'goodbye'.",2

1616310782,"I have same problem. I decided to deposit some cash during their event with no fees for buying crypto with your debit card.

1616586294,"Well they deposit back, BUT NOWHERE YOU CAN SEE A FAQ: ""What to expect when a deposit fails"".  Like a simple reply: we deposit back on first business day after deposit date or business day itself. Make sure your card = bank account on pdf file (bank statement) you used for address verification.",1

1616247152,"Symbiotic _bnb, could you PLEASE escalate my ticket as well?  Thank you in advance! CASE ID # 543152 Going on three weeks, all of a sudden my deposits were not being allowed even after I followed their instructions to the letter and tried to re-sync with Plaid, strange as I was verified and trading and had seamlessly deposited at least 10 times previously.  I then manually deactivated my account ( now I’m moron for doing so ) thinking by immediately reactivating I’d be able to re- synch my banking link. Well, I never received “ the Binance validation email “ to reactivate and my account has been locked for many days. No customer service assistance, only crickets. Not only is my trading business impaired, I’m concerned they are absconding with my crypto and funds.",1
1616199892,"Thanks, I'll check it out.",1
1616342308,/u/symbiotic_bnb can you escalate my ticket or concern to Binance team? My case number is 4524462. I have been waiting for a senior agent to attend the chat for a week and I have been waiting for my fiat deposit for more than a month. Thank you,1

1616383817,You resubmitted your ticket?,1
1616600687,Yes I must say most time when fails it does refund within a  day but on this occasion I deposited £5K one after another during the weekend but this occasion both failed no refund so I had to follow up to query the   Customer service but reply was 5 working days refund but when 5 days up no show I contacted the customer service again now the reply was up to 10 days! What the f... is going on I asked myself !,1
1616384174,"Sorry, I resubmitted my ID 3 different times for re-verification. I was locked out my account because the phone that had my 2FA stopped working. It was my fault for that having the back up code for 2FA from my old phone. But I got things working.",1
