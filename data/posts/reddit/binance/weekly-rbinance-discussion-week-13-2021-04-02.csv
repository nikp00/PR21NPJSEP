When support contacted me back I informed have a accidently transferred bBADGER which is a tokenized bitcoin in their SETT vault, which holds no liquidity. So when I request manual access to the wallet I sent it to, the request gets shot down because the bot says that the coins don't match. I explained this to the human support and they said that they would need a fee of 0.001 BTC to solve this issue and that was 3 weeks ago.
