1615218266,"From a critical thinker Redditor, not mine This is currently the top comment, which is why I'm replying here, but... everyone needs to take this post with a huge grain of salt. ----- **Major fuckup 1:** OP's grandfather wired 6 figures from a *business* bank account to a *personal* Binance account, without ever having done business with Binance before. Common scam. Major red flag. Any bank would've done the same as Binance. ----- **Major fuckup 2:** OP seems to have been the one communicating with Binance, which means a middleman was communicating with Binance in place of the person whose personal account was wired money from a business account. That seems even shadier.  I say that OP was likely the one communicating with Binance, despite their statements to the contrary, because nobody who is scared of online banking uses fucking ProtonMail, lmfao. And honestly, after thinking about it, this makes me doubt the veracity of the entire post, because that whole piece of the puzzle seems really weird. ----- **Major fuckup 3:** OP spent so much time communicating with random customer service reps, who had no fucking clue what was going on, rather than hiring a lawyer, because this is a legal/fraud issue, not some technical issue. Customer service reps likely aren't given access to that kind of info, and even if they were, it's unlikely they would be allowed to talk about the shit they pay lawyers for. Lawyers are generally needed to deal with these issues no matter what financial institution we're talking about. ----- Also, OP doesn't seem to understand why it was a problem that their grandfather was using a business account as a personal account. And OP's grandfather is *still using that account for conducting business at the same time*! So not only is it *not okay* to use a business account like this, even if the business was closed, the business isn't even closed because he's still collecting invoices! This was some super shady wire transfer shit that OP and their grandfather engaged in. EDIT: Somebody mentioned this might have been part of some legit money laundering, and I'm inclined to agree. A lot of details don't add up - why was the grandfather who is scared of online banking using ProtonMail, why was the first wire sent for 6 figures, rather than a smaller test amount, why were the funds sent from a business account like they were, why have they refused to contact a lawyer after all this time... It all just seems really sketchy, and perhaps they've left out some significant details here. Like the fact that they're doing illegal shit, lol.",2
1615104855,Was it flexible stacking? Or fixed terms? If you withdraw too early maybe you don't have interests or maybe your amount of interests was too low to be calculated. 100usdt with low Apr is not much. And the pnl is indicative only and frequently not accurate,1

My guess is stacking (or providing liquidity if you prefer it's the same here) with 100 usdt and 100 usdc for a few days with 8% Apr on flexible tenor would gives you peanuts and binance way not even bother stacking it irl and give you no fee/interests",1
