1615542016,"I just wanna say stuff really got me thinking. All my decisions, experiences, wins and dissapointments led me to this very moment.  I had a tough time most of my life, but not like living poor or unhealthy or having an abusive family, no, I just had various life experiences taken from me and feel inferior compared to my peers. My parents divorced when I was 7, I was lonely and misunderstood most of my life. But I'm actually pretty glad all of this happened because as I said it all led me to this moment, I'm 19 and I'm really heavy on self improvement, I read a lot, code and I recently got into crypto, and it really changed my life because I've learned not only how keeping track of personal finances is important but also the insane value of investing into your future.  Would I be the same if all those sad life experiences didn't happen to me? I mean they kinda made me who I am. This is like a butterfly effect, you know, take one part out and everything could change instantly. Any other way I would most likely fall into comfort and total mediocrity. And hey look, now I'm looking for more possibilities, even something like crypto can teach you a lot about life. I don't know why I'm posting it here  but I've been sitting in the dailies for months now, and it feels like I'm part of something big, a family. I dunno, I just really feel included and wanted to tell my story. If you've stopped to read this wall of text then I just want to say thank you.",8

1615552821,"I had a look at that Veve app just now. I kinda hate it. They're selling artificially scarce NFTs for 'ownership' of digital 3D models of pop culture characters. Like $40 for an 'uncommon' one, $80 for a 'rare' one. It's like trading cards, but instead of selling them in cheap packs that might contain a rare, they are upfront charging huge sums for the right to claim ownership of those they have decided to only sell 500 of for example. I've always been a bit of a collector, so I know that true collectable value is almost never manufactured - it is accidental. Sure some people will pay extra for the limited edition holo cover thing or whatever, but the vast majority of real collectables that acquire real long term value are things that were never intended to be deliberately scarce. EDIT: Oh, and for $80 you could get a really nice actual model that you can display on a shelf, rather than showing people a little rotating image on an app on your phone and saying 'I own this!'",7
