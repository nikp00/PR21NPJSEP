But I can say I’m a hodler and I’m waiting happily to recover my loses, as now I’ve invested 425 dollars, and today I’m almost 30 dollars to recover everything and start having profits, so to all my guys that fear to have loses just remember this is just the start and it will go up a lot, and down a lot but in long term, we will be up.

They constantly remain in motion and their moves in and out of any particular coin/project rhymes together - they never get emotionally attached to any particular project and they ride the profit waves emotionlessly.  And let me tell you something. They are in big numbers. They are mostly silent, relatively less vocal and smart in their money management. Often don't get bogged down in useless debates and go with where the market/prices are telling them to go. Trust me, they are not HODLERs. They like making money and at the moment, crypto asset class is their feasting place and will remain so for next few years. Stay safe.",7

1615122592,"Since I cant post How crypto made me more mentally stable I know the memes tell us how we age faster with crypto trading and price checking . And in my relatively new experience, it was nerve wracking in the first month, and I didn't sleep properly. Not because I invested too much but because I didnt want to miss out on any move. Of course this unbeatable strategy is not sustainable . After a while I got tired and anxious, I decided I would change things. I didn't have a whole lot of money to invest really so I wasnt going to put it on bitcoin or ethereum. Market cap too big for any significant gains with my small investment. I spent a whole week researching different coins, and  then another week or so researching my favorite out of those. Until I made my decision.  I am going to invest in this coin in particular, because I believe in its mission, in its potential for success and the infrastructure all around it that will not let it fail. And I will HODL through all the rollercoaster because this is a long term investment. If it crashes and burns I will accept it, although my research tells me its a very small possibility, I will accept it. The more I learn about crypto the more I believe in it so that's a good sign. My point is:  You need to be a stoic with this. If you do YOUR research properly, if you trust YOUR judgment, then whatever happens you did it on your own and you will not be constantly questioning yourself.  Think deeply and carefully for a while, study. And after you made your decision just accept your fate. Made me really reflect on other things in life where this thinking should apply. And the market rollercoaster experience made me stronger mentally in regards to this. So that's it, let me know If you also feel this way or if you have a different opinion.",10

I read in an article that EIP1559 is being implemented, even though the majority of miners is against this change. Why would they be against this? If I understood correctly - EIP 1559 will help to reduce the gas fees which could help to make eth overall more useful and better, which in the end should lead to a growing community and growing prices for eth. This would be good for miners. Or am I wrong? Thanks for your help, greetings to all from a newbie, holding ETH. :-)",4

1615157735,"Okay, this is interesting, whenever there is celebration of some coin success for one day there will be so many complaining, and there will be down voting. Can celebrate all crypto success, it's not so bad, if some investment will increase 40% one day, to be sure, people will become so excited, it is crazy my friends!  If it is spam about only some 5% increase, to be sure, I am confused too. But the exceptional performance of some investment will always be so exciting.",6
1615158047,"Just a casual and friendly reminder to take profits. If a coin continues to grow after you've taken profits, the profits are still yours.",5

1615161275,UNI cracks in the top 10! That makes ETH and 2 ERC tokens in the top 10. AAVE may one day crack the top 10 as well. Idk about all this gloom but Ethereum is alive and well. It's only going to get better from here.,6
1615161685,2021 just started and I’ve already created a tax nightmare for my future self. If I could go back in the beginning I’d tell my dumb ass noob self to never trade crypto. Sucks to be you future hobbit lol.,6

1615128638,I’m from the USA and I’m not dumping 🥺,10
1615135264,Buying in at 0.15 for LTO was probably my best decision this bull run,9

1615118748,LTO 🚀 Patience has been rewarded,14
1615079157,VET(VeChain) will lead the altseason.,11
1615082991,Anyone else found this urgency to save money and use it to invest in cryptos instead of buying crap you don’t need? Like why waste your money now when you can use it instead to build a bright future?!,10
1615107374,You should ignore 90 % of the stuff said on here,18
1615107186,ADA is currently having a much needed healthy consolidation. People need to calm down and look beyond the 24h charts,12
1615107423,"This sub has been very hot and cold on Ada over the past few years, but there are definitely a lot of haters lurking who just couldn't say anything when the price was going parabolic. Now that it's come down a bit they feel it's safe to come out with the negativity again. It's kind of silly though, because it's like a fighter who just won the belt, but people still want to hate on him because he didn't win by first round KO. People are weird.",9
1615084227,It’s a rite of passage.,15

1615115078,yesss.. bullish on LTO long term,18
1615080245,Yeah i liked this sub because it was chaotic . It was even funnier when a dip happens. But right now everyone is acting like we are in a Black Mirror episode,18
1615080036,Seems like solid tech working with smart contacts RFIDS and operations management.  Im surprised this is the first im hearing about it,8
1615114734,Yeah sometimes listening to shills pays off :D,7
1615076911,Half a million moons should do the trick,12
1615091159,"I swapped my LTC. Was a long term holder. I still believe it'll continue to rise over time. But the tech and marketing in this industry has evolved at rapid speeds and will continue to do so. LTC will be left behind in terms of gains compared to other alts. We're talking smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, there's nothing LTC does better than other coins.  I don't believe in Litecoin's silver to Bitcoin's gold standard. There's no reason not to buy Bitcoin if you purely want a store of value via blockchain.",6
1615098878,Guess you could say this sub's comments are..... 🤏😎 *Decentralized*,7
1615092590,Can always get more. VET isn't going anywhere. It still amazes me it isn't a top 5 crypto.,8
1615117776,"Nah, should be a top 50 coin atleast. If you can get your hands on it now then you'll still be in before majority of Americans",8
1615117568,"I think you would be very early still. SO much room to grow! Although, I'm waiting for the next dip down for my next DCA into LTO. Buying on a big run like this is normally a good way to get burned. But, if you are in it for the long run, just buy now.",6
1615100549,A wise man I see. Nice ![gif](emote|vet2_emote|vet2),7

1615088210,VET deserves it,8
1615117054,LTO is superrrrr underrated. I heard its hard to buy if you’re in the US,10

1615082458,İf u just hodl u wont lose anything,6
1615090487,Lol that should be the signal. If XLM hits .45 we are at the peak !,7
1615098418,"As mentioned it’s a Harry Potter curse. MimbleWimble protocol was created by Tom Elvis Jedusor, the French version of Voldemort; and the creator of GRIN(taken from Gringotts) is called Ignotus Peverell, who had the invisibility cloak. One of the wallets is called 713 which was the high security vault of Gringotts. MimbleWimble prevents secrets from being spilled. There is very little information on the blockchain, just a kernel confirming that the UTXO input matches the UTXO output. None of the transaction information is shared on chain. Lighter, faster and private. Edit: added details. I love MimbleWimble and I couldn’t not clean this up a bit.",5
1615115908,"LTO's biggest use-case now is ""anchoring"" business workflows, for proof of document authenticity (but are expanding into DIDs this year). The team actually has a revenue stream from their software solutions (that easily link legacy systems to the LTO Network) so they don't have to dump their coins on investors to make a living. The ATH in daily transactions was hit last week, 125k, making it one of the top 10 most used networks. Clients spent around 950k LTO in transaction fees in February, 270k of which was burned, and the rest went to stakers. That puts the staking return at about 7% annually, even though it has half of the supply staked right now (136mil LTO, the ATH) Their biggest name project is going to begin this month, the UN Land Registry. Right now Afghanistan is the first to move their land registry onto LTO, but there is another country following that hasn't been announced yet, and more are expected to follow. And another big client, SignRequest, was recently acquired by Box, who is used by a lot of fortune 500 companies. They are planning to push their document signing services to their clients this year: https://www.deep-analysis.net/box-acquires-signrequest-our-thoughts/ At just above 100mil marketcap, LTO is severely undervalued",21
