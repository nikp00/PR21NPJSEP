1615904283,"I have a feeling this sub is skewing my opinion of how people approach crypto. People who trade or buy coins often and who are always looking for new coins are very engaged with the community, so obviously they'll be very active here. On the other hand, people who make sound investments and hold will be less active. From reading this daily thread I get to urge to pump money into a different alt each day, based on whatever the hot topic is. But the better advice might be to put my head down and look away from the market.  Something to keep in mind.",36

1615896144,"This dip is really interesting - the most persuasive explanation I can find is via @woonomic on twitter. Basically Crypto Quant signalled that there was a massive whale dump coming into Gemini. This has been shown to be bogus and most likely it was either an internal transfer or BlockFi's wallet transferring into Gemini (possibly some sort of brokerage scenario), but either way was mislabelled by Quant.  Last time this happened was Feb 21 - check the BTC charts: the exact same dip happened while we were on a similar upwards tear.  Seems bonkers to me that this sort of unverified data can cause such significant price movements across the whole sector (although, anecdotally it doesn't feel like the alts are suffering as much as they used to with this sort of thing).  Either way, what's really fascinating to me is that this is all a result of the relative transparancy of blockchain. It simply isn't possible to do this sort of analysis outside of this sector.  /rant. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. EDIT: link to @woonomic's twitter.

1615913792,"As someone who has been invested in Enjin since 3 cents and sold none, I want to quickly describe why I am bullish. **Use case:** I have understood and agreed with the vision from the start. NFT's in games creating true item ownership across a gaming metaverse resonates with me. It reminds me of Ready Player One (read the book.) The world is getting more and more digital. And the idea of being able to earn items and sell, trade, lend them is amazing imo. **Team:** Enjin's team has proven to be committed to this project and has already delivered many great things, like the awesome Enjin wallet and SDKs. Witek is the man behind the ERC-1155. The whole ecosystem works NOW, off the shelf, with more improvements coming like Jumpnet and Efinity for scaling. **Adoption:** They already work with Microsoft and Samsung. There's already indie games using it. I expect many more partnerships to come as NFTs gain in popularity. https://enjin.io/about/powered-by-enjin **Tokenomics:** There are 1 billion max supply, of which over 80% are already in circulation. Beyond that, the model is deflationary since items are minted with Enjin. This means more and more Enjin will be locked away. Also, staking is coming which will lock away more Enjin. I've seen countless other NFT tokens out there with unlimited supplies. No thanks. Good luck!",10

I'm not here to shill VET, some of you love it some of you hate it. That's not my bother.  If you look at the order book the 15 sat spread has a wall of  206 BTC at the time of posting. Between 147 and 152 there is a wall of 120 BTC. Are there other coins whose order books look like this? This is nothing new for VET either. It is very expensive to get this coin to make large moves upwards. If there are coins with books as stacked as this I'd be keen to compare them.",16

Essentially when you stake, the protocol mints new Flash, which are then exchanged for (among others) WETH, DAI or XIO (there are Liquidity providers that get rewarded for providing this). This exchanged output is then sent to you. Once your stake expires, you can do it again! Typical stakes are 30 days or more.

There's Cosmos, Solana, and even Polkadot are literally YEARS ahead of what ADA currently is. Now I am not saying ADA won't succeed, I hold some myself. But as it stands, it is heavily overvalued.
