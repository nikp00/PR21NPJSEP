1615293669,"Tip: If you are long term hodling some ETH and want to stake it on Binance, do not use the ETH 2.0 'Stake now' button which swaps your ETH for BETH 1:1 (the BETH represents your stake) Instead buy BETH for ETH on the market for a 3% discount usually. You still get the staking rewards which are distributed to BETH holders. If you are staking long term then eventually your BETH will swap for ETH 1:1, so it's effectively cheap ETH with staking rewards.",5

This is my first bull run and I’m only 3 months into being balls deep in crypto (dabbled in 2018 but only btc, ltc).  I have no experience of what to expect when a coin is listed on Coinbase.  My research suggested the impact on value was lower than hype suggests.  My experience of listings on binance is a big pump followed by an immediate correction then stabilisation.  Should I expect the same with Coinbase?  I ask as I’m anxious about what to expect and also don’t want to miss an easy sell high buy low on the correction op.  Obviously not looking for advice but curious to know experiences of those who have been there before.  Thanks!!",6

1615295315,"Every client using LTO will need to replenish their supply from the market. In February, clients paid 928k LTO in fees. With an ATH in daily transactions hit last week, at 125k. And those tx fees are part burned, and the rest is returned to stakers. And stakers aren't selling, even through this dip. The staked amount is at the ATH 137.6mil, over half of the circulating supply. And the amount on Binance is under 45.5mil, down from over 60mil in January. Not only will current clients need to re-up, new clients will need to acquire some too. The team is aiming for a 25% MoM growth in transactions, and some of the largest projects yet (UN, KATE, shrimp, and potentially Box) haven't even started their new transactions. Again, almost 1 million LTO was spent this month by CURRENT clients, all of which will need to be replenished when their wallet runs low. to sum: 1. Binance wallet is shrinking day by day 2. 51% of the supply is already staked 3. When you do the math, binance wallet will be empty in a few months 4. The supply available on the exchanges will be very tiny at this time And that doesn't even include the conceptual tokenomic aspect of it all. The supply squeeze is coming.",9
