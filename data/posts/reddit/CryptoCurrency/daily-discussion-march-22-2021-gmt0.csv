1616440136,"I said this earlier today but...Are polls still open? Because that stickied post about purchasing membership to allow posting is complete and utter bullshit. Spam and Scams can now post so long as they pay a few dollars (and people automatically assign more credence to members here - often mistaking them for mods - no issue with that, for our regulars, but this will deceive a lot of newer people coming). Extremely disappointed, especially in the lack of community discussion about it. A proposal should be done for this kind of decision, although with the amount of moons mods hold, i do wonder how that would go... The only comment now added is a fucking joke too: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/magbth/new_users_who_purchase_rcryptocurrency_special/grtjr7d/ 'thanks to the users who requested this in modmail' - now implementing this desired feature. Because that seems transparent? My experience of modmail when i submitted a long post for discussion around moon utility? Ignored. I don't care about that, but now implementing something like this with zero discussion, zero transparency, zero actual good reasoning and not allowing the community to discuss it?  I mean, it isn't even about the issue itself, perhaps my view would be proven unpopular and people do love this idea, but it is the principle and the precedent it creates",23

It's amazing to look back at where crypto was and how far it's come in such a short period of time. >Imagine the Fomo when we get back to 10k O_o  There are comments like this throughout.   People excited that BAT might hit .30.  Most coins have come a long way, which is a good sign to just hold.  But some being hyped up throughout the thread are now dead (TRON).

1616448661,"Everyone watching the 1 minute chart thinking a green candle means “dip no more”. This is what crypto has done to me and a lot of people: watching the chart all day, only to see a 2-3% fluctuations the entire day and realize that short term price action didn’t mean shit. All that time being glued to our phones thinking if we stare at the screen hard enough, a green candle will print on the 5 minute, leading to a 10x gain the same day. It’s the truth. That’s why these daily discussions are always so active. Because when we see the slightest change in percent, we come here commenting “LTO/Vechain/One/Eth to the moon” or “XLM at 41 cents!” or now with people talking about the dip is over because a wild green stick appears. This is a rant for myself mostly, but crypto being as volatile as it is makes most of us want to keep track of what’s going on more frequently. If your phone or PC can track how much time you spent on a specific app (for your portfolio) I’d think a lot of us would be disgusted.",20
