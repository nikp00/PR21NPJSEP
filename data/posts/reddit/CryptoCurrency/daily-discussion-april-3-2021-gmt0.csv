1617462318,"Hey cryptodudes.  Long time lurker on Reddit, been here on the sub since the final of January thanks to the Gamestop fever which led me to the Doge fever ( yeah, dont crucify me, i now do my own research and invest more wisely) which instead lead me to the crypto fever. I now have finally the needed days on my account to comment here and just wanted to thank you guys for making me do the leap from lurker to poster. I've been here on Reddit for years but only this community made me feel the urge to participate and not just be a mere observant. The vibes here are phenomenal and the energy is addictive. May our way be guided by the green dildos from afar and the general triumph of crypto our beacon. Greetings from Portugal!",37

1617432520,"Can I say that the one thing I absolutely love about this sub is how open/alright everyone is with people selling? I *dare you* to go into WSB and say you're selling your GME or AMC. You'll have -500 downvotes in 2 minutes and death threats in your PMs and people trying to doxx you (a bit of an exaggeration, but the downvotes and PMs are real). Saying *anything* negative is met with ""shill"" and ""bot"" and ""fuck yourself"".  Meanwhile here if I say I'm interested in selling, you guys give advice on how to get out and aren't as much of a cult as WSB has become. You all will say ""your crypto, your money. Do what's best for you"". For the most part, negativity is fine as long as you explain yourself and aren't just spamming ""BTC IS SHIT SELL NOW SELL SELL SELL"".  Idk, just the absolute polar opposites between here and WSB is great.",27

1617409167,"/r/cc has seen a hostile takeover and has become the main sub to talk about ethereum. Ethereum 2.0, with even more ethereum talk than the original sub! * The daily saw 14k comments, with 10k+ of them being about ETH. * The market cap moved up to 1.95t * BTC slept. * ETH bashed at 2k's door, crashed it down, broke a new ath, broke down the 2100 door, broke a new ath, and is currently knocking that 2150 door, not satisfied with its current ath. * ETH comments have gained 50000%. * I fear this day, for I can't takETH any more of it!  * BNB went to 350 now sitting at 340. * ADA also continued sleeping. * DOT broke 40 and on CG took over ADA's rank. * UNI broke 30. * LINK also broke 30. * FIL still sitting above 170. Not wanting to crash just yet. * XLM refusing to go back to 40 cents stablecoin, fighting hard for that coveted 50 cents position. * BTT hit an impressive 0.7 cents. I'm shaking my head, my neck hurts. * AAVE went above 400. * ATOM broke 20 again. * DOGE lost most its gains from the day before. * EGLD managed to get some talk in through the ETH comments, and managed an impressive 13% gains. Currently sitting near 170. * While LTO was overshadowed by ETH, it saw plenty of shilling still despite only minor gains. * HOT and BTT are the biggest gainers with 35 and 27%. Though ETH's market postion makes its 8% gains very impressive indeed. * FIL lost 11%, followed by AR's 10% and BTMX's 9%, showing that FIL is a tough sonofabitch.  * Into the top 500 we're seeing EDR with 118% gains. And a lot of others with 40-70% gains, showing just how strong alt season is being right now. * For the losers we're looking at SPND with 28% as worst losers. Which is okay, cause I don't own any of it anyway. EL with 20% is second biggest loser, and at third spot we have... DORA... Or, Dora Factory... Fuck, crypto. Learn to name your coins better! * On the overal, we've seen a lot of great gains across the board, from shit coins to power houses (btc feels left out), green is the ruling colour. * On today's mental image we have the Ethereum logo burned into my retina. Please send help. ;.; Quick note: Today I got the ""100 awards club"" trophee. Thank you all so much for your continued love. <3",84

1617494440,"My FOMO has me keeping on further and further down the rabbit hole. First I was happy to just hold crypto and throw some cash in now and then. I didn‚Äôt follow any updates or anything. I had my couple coins and liked them. Then I began reading up on news coins and tokens while keeping up with developments in existing coins and tokens. Next I learned about DEXs and began to keep tabs on them. Then DeFi has me constantly finding new projects to try to stay in tune with. But I‚Äôm constantly finding new protocols/DAOs to read through and add to my Twitter, follow on medium, and join their telegram, bookmark resources to read later then of course periodically checking back. I get a good bit of downtime at work to spend on crypto but my screen time has quintupled since I started getting more involved. I want to streamline my crypto information diet but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll miss out on something new that‚Äôs interesting or valuable. At least my smartphone is getting some use. I used to just check the news wire and maybe a few choice subreddits.",7
1617484025,"I've posted a few of these recently, but the posts themselves never get much traction for some reason. So I have decided to post it as a comment here. As an aside, it feels like my thread was shadow banned because it had literally no upvotes/comments...but perhaps people really just don‚Äôt find it interesting though! Anyway, for those that just want the data - you can find it here: https://i.imgur.com/CFqsVBJ.png  Jumping in, March 2021 has been an interesting one. For starters, it not only bucked the general trend of being a red month, but it performed nearly 3x better than average. Clocking in 30.47% performance, beating out the 9 year average of 10.96%.  As above, prior to 2021 there have only been 2 green March's ever in BTC's history; the average performance of 10.96% is dragged up solely by 2013 which had a whopping 186.76% returns. When you exclude 2013 the average performance is in fact -11.01% So it's safe to say, no matter which way you want to look at it, March has been an outstanding month, and in fact, 2021 has been a great year, clocking an average monthly return of 27%.  So you might be pretty pumped at this point, but if you take a close look at the table above, you'll see that BTC has never in it's entire history had a green streak longer than 6 months. Starting October 2020, we have just completed our 6th green month in a row. In fact it's such a rarity, that we haven't had 6 green months in a row since 2013 (Nov 2012-April 2013). If history is anything to go by, this April will be a bloody one, because unless it bucks 9 years of trends, we have never had 7 green months in a row.  I'm just throwing that out there to make sure you're aware of the possibility, April itself is generally a positive month, with an average performance of 19.46%. But April might only be positive because March is usually negative and it's easier to recover from - it's something to keep in mind. In the table I've linked to, you might find some other interesting takes, I'd love to hear them. So feel free to reply with you comments!",21
