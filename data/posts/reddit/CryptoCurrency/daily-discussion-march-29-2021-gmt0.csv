1617028548,"When Einstein was developing his theory of quantum mechanics he found that Newtonian physics calculations were incorrect when applied at the subatomic level. This was partly due to the fact that at such a small scale there is no point of reference to measure against. Einstein concluded that he needed to find a universal constant, a point of reference that could never change and stay stable throughout the whole universe and for all of time, and thus, XLM was born.",15

1616977287,"Yesterday's daily barely managed to hit 10k, despite great efforts by spammers and automod! * The market cap hasn't moved much. * Many coins haven't moved much, with reds and greens staying within 2% * LTO was the big talk of the day. The first of the Ginyu force to arrive. At the start of the day, 90% of the comments were LTO. Though it ""only"" moved about 12% * XLM moved above 40 cents and then went back down under. * KLAY moved up to rank 14, people keep wondering what KLAY is. Coingecko doesn't list it high as punishment for CMC not listing OMI in the top 100. * FUD surrounding Litecoin is making people sell litecoin bags. FUD here is not enough price movement. * Though GRT wasn't talked about much, it gained a lovely 23%! * ONE with almost 25% was talked about some, but not nearly as much as overshilled LTO. * MANA with 20% was another common mention. Though it also couldn't beat LTO shilling. * Big gainer ANKR didn't gain the past day, with 15% loss. * Moons mentions are still common but declining. * Many users are hyper for 2m members. * The top 3 gainers of the top 100 the past day were GRT, ONE and MANA, with 20-25% growth. * On the loser side we're seeing BTMX with a very solid 35% loss. ANKR and STORJ didn't do well either with 15 and 13% loss. * Outside into the top 500 we're seeing NBR with 50% growth and a weekly growth of a mere 280.000%. Its massive $1163 volume shows its strength.  Another big gainer with 45% was MITH, and people are starting to talk about MITH. * On the loser side we're not seeing anything special with 20% losses being fairly common. None stand out. * Overal, this is another day with relatively little excitement and mostly stability. Some ups, some downs, some sideways. Gambling minds are suffering. * Today's mental image is a graveyard during a spell gone wrong. A few zombies and skeletons get out, but most are just softly thumping on their chest from the inside, hoping to also get to play. Edit: it's Monday! This was suppose to be a weekly! Dumb me!",66

1616982195,"MIR finally breaking out after a while in the $6-7 range. V2 is coming and it will do well i think Synthetic assets you can also add to liquidity pools - it just launched the first tokenised synethic index (FAANG), and has limit orders and leverage long and shorts launching. Seeing as my post on Terra (LUNA) here was removed, i shall copy a small excerpt regarding MIR: The idea is for this to be used to tokenise any asset desired by the community, and to date it has focused on US equities - such as TESLA, GOOGLE, APPLE (and yes even GME), which has proven very popular with the east Asian audience who may find it hard to have access to these assets. It aims to offer high returns on assets and make them widely available to anyone, with low fees (0.1 UST to transact) and offer flexibility in 24 hour trading.  It has also recently introduced limit orders and will be looking to introduce options trading very soon with v2. The assets which can be introduced are endless, and just rely on community governance to launch. This is the first of a few ways terra presents a great hedge against a crypto bear market without converting your money back to fiat - if things like commodities begin to be listed (and yes, bonds). Mirror was launched in february this year and within a month had over $1bn in TVL and a $300m market cap. And they have recently launched FAANG (facebook, apple, amazon, netflix, google) to become the first tokenised index on an AMM and the system now allows for USDT and USDC on-ramp via the mobile app.   https://www.coinbureau.com/review/mirror-protocol-mir/ - coinbureau overview on mirror. - on MIR (synthetic assets): https://unreliablenarratives.substack.com/p/mirror-decentralized-investing-for - Mirror site: https://mirror.finance/ - Mirror app: https://terra.mirror.finance/gov - Mirror whitepaper: https://mirror.finance/MirrorWP.pdf",8

(Basically every single network can do this) What *is* unique to LTO is how much they focus on it as an advertising point in the market and make it easy for companies to do so via LTO hosting a web API service to interact with and perform these anchoring actions on their blockchain in a centralized format (which doesn't involve their clients having to run/directly connect with an LTO node). Basically their selling point is 'Hey, send us a web request with some info, and we'll put it on the blockchain and guarantee it becomes secure/immutable.'  And then pushing that case for use with things like their land registry project partnership. Tl;Dr; Not actually very interesting/unique/special tech, but a good sales/marketing team behind it making waves with partnerships & knowing how to sell their product in a focused way.",9
