Don't have to beat BTC.  * Surprisingly ADA didn't dip further, instead making a little recovery. * DOGE now at 6.2 cents, again showing life isn't always about beauty.  * I wonder if I'll ever make an update again where ATOM hits 20.  * NFT's again get loads of attention, though darling CHZ takes a tumble. Probably faking it. Drama queen! * MANA again heavily mentioned because it's got a cool name. * ETC performing better than ETH.  * BTT somehow making big gains.  * NANO still in the top 100.  * The BSC trio causing a centralised pool of tears.  * The top 100's biggest winners today are HOT, NXPS and MANA. All having over 50% gains  * The bitboy shilled tfuel today's biggest loser. * Whining about how moons are destroying this sub continues.  * Pissed off btc elitists not satisfied with big gains without bashing shitcoins for performing better.  * Today's mental image is hordes of finance-unaware tweens sticking out their tongues at the established billionaires, fully believing their crypto invested lunch money will make them the elites soon. * An adorable lady always very thankful for the love you're giving her.

They just want to buy $APPL or $GME on the blockchain 24/7. While that is a good part of synthetics, it is just replicating our existing market on the blockchain. What is far more powerful and exciting is that with synthetics we can do something new. >With synthetics you can turn any quantifiable discrete event into a financial feed that people can buy and sell. >You can create an asset based on the “Unemployment Rate in Hong Kong” or “Average Annual Rainfall in Seattle” or the “Number of iPhones Sold Annually”. >These synthetic assets allow you to buy long or short depending on if you think the number will go up or down, and this creates two powerful cases. >*Synthetic Case 1:* >First, you can now give anyone in the world performance rewards based on specific criteria. Imagine the Mayor of a city, they get their base salary but they also get a bonus package that basket of tokens representing the inverse unemployment rate, the city happiness score, and the inverse crime rate in their city. The better results they create for their city, the more their tokens are worth. >*Synthetic Case 2:* >Synthetics are powerful because you can boot strap liquidity in anything. Such as the “Average Annual Rainfall in Seattle.” But why does that matter?If you can get liquidity in any discrete quantifiable event then what have you created? The world’s most accurate financial data system. >What is financial data used for? >Insurance, lending, hedge funds, risk mitigation, banking, yield, mortgages, credit scores etc. Insurance adjusters need to know how often it rains in a region to know how that impacts their models on home owners insurance. Mortgages need to know how much it rains in a region because rainy areas get less people moving to them to buy houses, meaning houses are often worth less. >Incentivized synthetics allow you to start building an open financial data market. But once you have synthetics, you own the financial data stream to anything because you can incentivize liquidity to make it more accurate. Those who own financial accuracy can then pick any finance business they want to start. Goodbye Moody’s, Meridian, Experian, Fannie Mae, and others.

Started to get a little too into it recently,  tried my hand at ""swing trading"", ended up selling early on big  potential profits. Was pretty bummed at first, but it was a good lesson. After  this month though, I no longer see crypto as a fun ""game"" or potential  for short term capital gains, I'm now a true believer in blockchain  technology, and am eager to see how it is developed and implemented into  our lives over the coming years and decades. I  realise I'm potentially too late in this market cycle for insane 100x  growth, but I'm looking forward to seeing how this bull run plays out,  hopefully I see some modest profits on my small investment. The real  plan now is to hodl, keep studying blockchain technology, and stay  engaged in the space as this market cycle ebbs, and the next picks up.  But who knows really.

It’s better Lee is out. Litecoin is not Beholden to him like Satoshi is not beholden to BTC cause he is anonymous. Institutions are buying Litecoin “grayscale” “square” “microstategy” more and more. Litecoin will probably fulfill its promise of silver in the end. Mumblewimble will make Bitcoin and litecoin private if people opt in. Institutions are looking at stored value. And litecoin is being hoarded right now for value not necessarily usage. But I Ask you??? What Coin will be the most Useful to BitCoin????? Litecoin and the Mumblewimble Protocol!!! Hmmm. Yea Ether is better but it’s better than Bitcoin too but Bitcoin is worth more. Store Of value is Bitcoin and next Litecoin because of their symbiotic partnership. Ether will rise in value as well due to usage but as a store of value in institutional money Litecoin is next!!,12

House paid, money in the bank, daughter college tuition and even a lifetime of cigarettes. It sucks to feel heavy FOMO such as seeing CHZ perform so well.

1615688037,"I thought this was a particularly insightful perspective on Bitcoin/DLT and why some people do/don't like it:  >And this is the problem. You shouldn't buy in if you don't understand why you would want to hold it for years and decades. If you're just looking to scalp some gains off the mania, then you're very likely to exit at a loss when you experience your first 30% correction that happens over a couple days. >The best explanation I've ever read about why smart, well educated people can be so diametrically opposed in their opinion on bitcoin, is the level of trust they have in the establishment system. For various reasons in my personal experience and resulting philosophy on life, I have severe issues in relying on systems of human trust. As much as feasible, I don't want to give others power to abuse and use me without my consent, and bitcoin is a vessel of that need. I see bitcoin as a new, incorruptible foundation of trust from which human cooperation can build off and flourish. >If you don't have a similar kind of lived experience, you might not ever understand the value of bitcoin. >Or at least, you won't realize the value until it's too late.  The discussion is quite interesting and worth a few minutes to check out. It's from [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26449731) which I learned from the reddit post (in ""new"" section right now) [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m4l7vv/need_compelling_proof_that_the_crypto_game_is/).

LTC and the Privacy Coins (ZCash/Monero) have held up a bit better in the minus 10% range, which is closer to the market average, but the only one actually positive against BTC on the 30 day charts is DASH right now. It's always possible for a trend to reverse, but I suspect there's not going to be much new interest in digital currency type coins for a while unless laws change on the matter.

If you hold something good long enough, high chances that you will be right eventually. 6.Market is always right. If you lost money, it's your fault. Don't blame others.
