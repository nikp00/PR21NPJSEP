For a couple years now I‚Äôve been investing a percentage of my income toward crypto (predominately BTC), and another % toward gold and silver reserve stores. The crypto has obviously been substantially more lucrative in that timeframe, but I value (perhaps too much) the universal demand and consistent long-term appreciation of precious metals, and can‚Äôt convince myself to abandon them altogether. Could anyone explain to me the drawbacks (and their severity, if noteworthy) of holding gold-backed crypto like PAXG instead of physical gold? It sounds like PAXG is backed by physical bars rather than any sort of derivative value, so I would imagine the value would track almost identically to gold itself. It would simplify my investment strategy significantly to be able to hold all investments as crypto, but I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm overlooking anything when considering it.

1616916567,"Neo network upgrade : N3, due q3 of 2021. Testnet rolled out on the 26th of March.  It competes with  Ethereum (2 in market cap)  Bsc (3 in market cap)  Ada (5 in market cap)  Dot (6 in market cap).  While neo is sitting at #38 in market cap. Built into N3:  Interoperability, native oracles, self-sovereign ID, decentralised storage, one block finality, dev tool kits with multiple language support (c#, js/ts, go, python)  It hasn‚Äôt had a significant pump at all in btc value. Fully functioning Defi product (flamingo) with high apy and very low fees.  They havnt even started marketing it with hackathons and further support. They always incentive devs to come build on their platform, and have one of the largest warchests in crypto. Look up NGC and their funds and projects they are vested in.  Good luck. You owe it to your self to DYOR. It has so many features packed into a complete blockchain ecosystem.  #NFA",11
1616922997,"We are a bit quiet today, and I don't really discuss it much here, but thought it could be a bit of fun.  Not looking for rate my portfolio - but sharing a little bit from what i have put together over the last few weeks in advance of a possible alt season, will give a little context (and please be aware this isn't everything i hold and i also am a big fan of diversifying assets - just my approach and works for me, find what works for you) - LUNA - this is now 35-40% of my portfolio and i added to it on the pull back, this won't change.  - RUNE - added this in the last correction, bought in around 4.75 average - looks good so far and with chaosnet coming i have high hopes as a medium term hold - ORN - Annoyed i only jumped into this one 'late' - expect it to have significant upside if they pull off what they want to. Not a huge amount in, but i like it a lot - TVK - nft exposure, I have been in this since $0.09 (2 months ago), had a sharp decline due to a supply increase which i disagreed with + a general nft cool off. But the project itself continues to do well, made my second ever buy of TVK at $0.7 on this dip.  -  SCRT - this one (along with ATOM) have been pretty frustrating holds the last month or so, but i have continued to slowly accumulate, i see both as having big upside and generally the longer a consolidation - the bigger the spike. Not saying trade charts per se, i believe in the fundamentals of this and ATOM very strongly. SCRT is privacy smart contracts and a swap, with SEFI governance coming on the 31st and a lot of cross-chain integration etc.  - TRAC - this is locked up in the starfleet blockchain migration and will stay that way, 500% up, not much to say beyond i like it.  - PPAY - been in this one since $0.05, highly ambitious, with the eth/uni delays could do well - got hyperloop, a fee-less layer 2 built on eth launching this quarter, just launched their ido/nft launchpad, staking 100% returns and has a fiat on/off ramp service, business solutions, portfolio management etc.... Frankly they are trying to do a heck of a lot, but to date they are delivering extremely quickly, and at 44m market cap i am not stressed by holding it just in case of 'what if' Some random moonshots:  - MOD (modefi) - Oracle aggregator, 22m supply, sub 10m marketcap and i think oracles will have a run soon. In addition to MOD, i also am running a 20x long on TRB - which is doing very well and i will hold for the next few weeks (ideally, take profits are set) - BONFI - Liquidity mining pool based on AI and ran by a DAO (buzzwords r us, i know - but i actually think its a neat idea and at 5m market cap happy to throw a little cash in) - MP3 - this i haven't invested in yet (waiting for bilaxy funds), but i will watch it. Very risky, could go to zero play. But basically similar idea to AUDIO, with a yield curve for artists and ran by the BMEG DAO. 1m market cap.

This is the first step of enabling cross-chain communication, which activates IBC token transfers - allowing you to send fungible tokens from one chain to another. As the first chain to have a permissionless and open source cross-chain token transfer protocol, this will enable numerous novel use cases for cross-chain DeFi. In our 3 hour event, we'll show you how IBC works by making a live demo of tokens transfer to/and from Cosmos Hub, how you can transfer IBC tokens using Keplr or how you can connect chains using the Hermes relayer! Join us to meet some of the brilliant minds behind Interchain Foundation, Interchain GmBH, Tendermint, Iqlusion, Regen Network,Informal Systems, Agoric, IrisNet, Peggy JV and others who worked towards shipping IBC. We will be discussing how the journey from whitepaper to Roadmap 1.0 has been so far, our thoughts on how the Interchain environment looks like in an IBC world and what we believe the immediate use cases of IBC would be.""",6
