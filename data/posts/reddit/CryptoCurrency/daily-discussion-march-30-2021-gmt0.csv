WAN with over 50% is also a solid gainer... Wanchain. DAC with 120% and DORA with 70% further really stand out.  * For the losers we have, of course,BOTX with 20%.

1617139927,"Moons additions/changes to make them actually do stuff:     * NFT's. If /r/cc added some fun NFTs to be used as avatars/icons/gifs/etc within Reddit, not bound to a specific reddit account, that could be a fun addition many here would likely enjoy a lot. Each NFT of course in limited numbers. Competitions to win NFTs for free. Stuff like that. * Membership cost reduced. It's been costing well over $50 moons value for a month of membership for too long now! It creates value for it to actually make sense to buy membership with moons. * A sort of coin burn was talked about where coins would be sent to a temporary burn address to later be reintroduced to the moons for karma deal we've got going. How about half gets reintroduced and half gets sold?  With the money going towards a good cause this sub decides in a poll each month. Adding a good cause to moons by default would be an absolutely brilliant way to grab some attention! * Moon stats. How much of it is in official reddit vaults, how much of it never left faults, how much of it got tipped, how much used to purchase something with, little things like that. People love statistics! (at least basic statistics) and it automatically makes moons a little more interesting to know what's going on with them.",7
