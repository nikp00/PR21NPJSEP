Though the page for ENJ has since been removed.  Rumor is going strong this means they're up next to be listed (soon) on the exchange. ***More Greyscale Trusts*** - The next coins Greyscale has filed trust documentation for (but not brought to market/announced yet) are [AAVE/ADA/ATOM/DOT/XMR](https://www.coindesk.com/digital-asset-manager-grayscale-eyes-defi-space-with-new-trust-filings?amp=1).  These were filed roughly one week after the last set, which went live this past week, opening up the rumor that this coming week could include public trust announcements for these coins. ***XRP/SEC Legal Case*** - Legal hearings this week in the XRP-SEC case came with some interesting news/legal confirmation that trading XRP would [only be legally questionable for Ripple staff/affiliates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc9llhRCHSE&feature=youtu.be), some are hoping this could mean XRP re-listings on US exchanges within the week/before the case concludes.

1616309231,"I realised why so many got burnt by pump and dump schemes, especially newcomers or those who just invest by hype(which is actually a good indicator but just not by itself). The overwhelming culture around here is HODL TILL LAMBO, BRO. thats totally fine. I HODL 80% of my initial funds. Basically, many came here to invest, then cash out in 3-6 months, or more and hopefully retire or good enough to pay off debts, loans, buy a home or own several lambos. Yet when they invest, they make ""trader decisions"". IE, they chased the pumps, or got lured by shills, thinking ""holy shit, if it pumps 20% in 10 minutes, imagine how much i would earn in 6 MONTHS!"". But traders come in, make 3-5% and we F OFF like bats out of hell. We stay 1-2 hour tops, thats already pushing it. Scalpers even much much less, 10-30 minutes. The rest stayed, in euphoria, thinking this would go on forever. Except they never do. And when it crashes, most are emotionally/mentally rekt coz they didnt see it coming. Then they panic sell or panic swap, whatever. Except experienced investors wouldn't coz they already knew that they had to ride the waves and are unfazed by it, just laughing it off or enjoying the weekend. Also, so many here live and practically got murdered by 15 min/5 minute charts. Again, those are trader charts, not investor charts. 4 hour/1D charts are where you make your decisions and you see a clearer picture on the strength and health of the potential investment in the long term. Many newcomers dont realise the 5 min/4D charts can look absolutely different and paint a very different picture. Investor do have a use for 5 min charts, if they are obsessed with nickel diming their entry point or they want to take advantage of dips to DCA in more funds. Other than that, 5 min charts is of little use to them. So if you are new, please ask yourself, are you here as a trader or an investor? If your mindset is set correctly, then you will have a fruitful experience and your journey will be much more smoother and hopefully less mistakes made. TLDR : i also have to say while the culture here is to HODL, but the behaviour here is also confusing to newcomers because its more akin to traders. When things should be ""look at this coin, guys, its really solid for the past month and this month, steady growth throughout"" but its more ""OMG GUYS SUPERCOIN IS TO THE MOON! ONBOARD OR STAY POORRRRR"" or ""ROCKET ROCKET ROCKET!"".",35

The problems range from lost keys, lost passwords, disappearing crypto when transferring.  I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äúnot your keys not your crypto‚Äù saying but that alone doesn‚Äôt convince me of anything. Maybe I want an exchange to hold my crypto for safety reasons because I‚Äôm hopeless when it comes to not losing things. Or maybe I‚Äôm naive to think my crypto is safe.  The one compelling reason to move your crypto to a wallet is for staking. So I understand that there are some major pros to wallets. And I‚Äôll likely wallet once I learn more.

1616289840,"There are so many scams out there, I just checked which crypto has had the best performance in the last week. Turns out it's this coin called [DEXA](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/DEXACOIN-DEXA), it went up a whopping 2,200% and had ¬£674k 24hr liquidity. Head to their socials to find out what it is, turns out it's a company aiming to create a ""revolutionary"" social media app that will ""take over the world."" Their website mostly has vague promises & doesn't really offer anything more than Facebook or Instagram (actually far less) apart from being able to send crypto payments through their version of messenger. Over to their twitter - they have a fair amount of activity, the comments look convincing and are related to the tweets but upon further inspection most of the comments are from accounts that only became active recently or were clearly hacked so I assume it's just one guy having a conversation with himself. [Here's the best one I found, they've faked a WhatsApp chat with Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/RobertinoRicard/status/1372215407306760194/photo/1) I mean you really need to admire their creativity but I think they made it a little too obvious with this one. A lot of effort has gone into this scam and it's amazing they've been pulling it off for a year now. I do wonder how much money they've made, or am I wrong and this is a legit project with enough financial backing to pay a team of at least 10 people for a year straight? Who knows, this is crypto.",5

1616307108,"Hey /r/cc! I made a thing to track liquid pools and some funky math calculations so you know the decisions you made were always wrong.  http://liquiditypoolfolio.com I originally made a local app for my own use as a tool, and for some learning fun. but feel free to check it out and use it to keep track of your own liquidity pool portfolio! Basically, it keeps record of your initial depost/ratios and such. And then calculates a % how much your ""invariable"" goes up, which is an alright measure of how much of trading fees you have received. Then it calculates a whole bunch of stuff to show you your current profits (or lack thereof), compared to what happened if you just HODL'd. I think it basically calculates your impermanent loss if the ""if HODL"" value is higher than current pool value. This is brand new, still got some things to update. and I am not a designer so sorry for the ugliness. But instructions will be on the first page when you arrive how to set it up yourself. There is no ""log in"", all the data is saved to an AirTable, and you provide the key/base to retrieve it from. So completely decentralized! Use as you please.  Example screen shots below. Basically, calculates my initial pool deposit. and what the current values are. And in the few days I‚Äôve been in the pool, I have not earned enough rewards to make up for the price fluctuation in this example. Cheers! https://imgur.com/a/NhFOPnL If my math is completely wrong, let me know. But I think it‚Äôs done correctly. This uses the ‚Äúinvariant‚Äù method of maintaining the ratio. Base x token in needs to equal base x token out. The total % change is where I can see a rough estimate of fee rewards I‚Äôve earned relative to initial deposit.",4

1616347154,That's one way to lock up the supply.,4
