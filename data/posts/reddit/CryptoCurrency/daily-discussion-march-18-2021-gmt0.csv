While percentually not the biggest gainer, it's one of the most shat upon coins in this sub. ADA fans now overrun the sub with excitement while haters sit in corners feeling ashamed and ETH fans are prodding their darling in the hope it does an ADA move. * The market cap has hit 1.82t! * Bitcoin flirting with the beloved 60k. * ETH managed to get above 1.8k.  * My beloved BNB (Cause I have bags of it) is moving up again making me happy. * XLM is up by a few %, but hasn't hit 41 cents yet. * Bigtime gainer LUNA has fallen nearly 10%.  * Filecoin, whatever it is, has gained a whopping 40% in value and 5000% in mentions. * Recently declared dead NFTs are coming alive again.  * VET once more gaining. Pure hatred will probably start by the time they reach 10 cents. * ATOM managed to stay above 20. Longtime stablebuddy XLM is sad it's leaving him. * ZIL has seen a few extra mentions with its 20% rise in price. Strange huh, how these coins only ever get talked about when they gain? * FLOW briefly hit 110 quadrillion market cap again before falling hard. * Crypto fans are seeing growth in their 1 inch. * Kyber Network finds itself at 100 after a nice 28% growth. Though it sounds like it is, let's assume it's not a scam coin. * Many coins in the top 100 I don't know at all, as random shitcoins start taking over. (I don't know them so they're shitcoins and if you don't like it, file a complaint! *pushes the trash bin in front of me*) * Filecoin, Kyber and Zil are the past day's biggest gainer. While BAT also made good gains, they're not in the top 3! Hah! * The biggest loser of the day is Luna at 8%, with second place sitting at 3% * Very little red to be found in the past day and most red is only minor red. * Outside of the top 100, stormx has seen an increased amount of mentions with its gains, and there is a Grumpy furry buddy on the rise. Contender to fight (un)beloved Doge? * Today's mental image is a zombie apocalypse with ADA being the zombies.",113

1616083533,"**Upcoming ATOM catalysts:** **1) The Gravity DEX**, an automated market maker that will allow ATOM holders to use their ATOMs to create liquidity pools and take a cut of the transaction fees.  **2) Institutional buying.** Grayscale has an open filing to create a Cosmos trust. Paradigm also recently bought $240M of ATOM and staked it. **3) Interblockchain communication adoption.** IBC was deployed recently, but as more volume flows across the Cosmos Hub ATOM stakers will be rewarded with tx fees.  **4) Shared security ""rentals"".** Cosmos will continue allowing blockchains to retain sovereignty and maintain their own security model if they choose, but soon smaller chains which find it difficult to recruit enough validators can instead rent security from the Cosmos Hub. More value for ATOM stakers.  **5) Potential supply squeeze.** Over 72% of ATOM is staked currently with a 21 day unbonding period. As more people and institutions (like the aforementioned Grayscale Trust) want to buy into ATOM, there may not be enough liquid ATOM to go around, creating a supply squeeze which sends the price of ATOM quickly to the moon.",13

If you need a good reminder about this, I recommend watching this gem from 2018, where an ETH developer calls out Block One for raising over $4 billion on an ICO that had nothing more than an Adobe PDF document behind it. https://vimeo.com/278019753 I can think of a few coins pumping right now today that are pulling the exact same shenanigans.

1616088248,"Law of one price. I guess I should give my opinion on the volatility today with ADA being added to CBP. I see people complaining that they bought at 1.80 and it dropping to 1.35. It's amazing to me how people didn't see this coming. Prices MUST converge to the global price. The run-up to 1.85 or 1.90 or whatever just shows the tremendous amount of demand for ADA (buyers willing to buy at that price), lots of FOMO and not understanding that when a new exchange starts trading, prices will always be strange until it reaches its steady-state. The market MUST converge back to what the global price is. Global exchanges were likely moving their ADA and migrating to CBP to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. Which helps explain reduction in global prices (lose volume en masse at global exchanges (low prices due to sellers leaving and having buyers overtake sellers) and the sellers moving assets to sell at CBP (high prices)). All of this is irrelevant for long-term holds. When and if Gemini (only a matter of time in my opinion) trades ADA, this will happen again. The volatility now just highlights the insane popularity and demand for ADA. Other coins would likely not get this trading volume. Please stop thinking short-term. Not an advisor of any sort, just a part-time MBA thinking out loud. If anyone disagrees, please correct me.",11

1616039934,"&#x200B; # 7 Months Ago... Orchid Labs released a statement that they have not started marketing Orchid yet because they still have a lot of kinks such as slow defective software, and had not released the Linux or Windows version. Flash forward to today, March 2021, what has changed with Orchid? Absolutely nothing. If you guys don‚Äôt see that this is project is doomed to fail yet, then you are blind. There is no curing you. If you do not see that this crypto was only created to enrich the retirement account of two old founders, Steven Waterhouse and Brian Fox, who have the oldest age of all crypto founders at 61.5 yrs old, then you are blind. These old farts don‚Äôt care about crypto. Steven only got in because he regretted not getting involved with Ethereum when he had the opportunity to. Brian Fox only got in due to his bitterness of how Wells Fargo treated him despite creating the original online checking account software and being very underpaid to do so. Regret and bitterness does not lead to success, creativity and innovation do. They haven‚Äôt marketed Orchid because they don‚Äôt care about the product. They only care about pumping and dumping it to fool noobs. Stay away from this shitcoin.",7

I need to move away from FOMOing, and just let crypto be crypto.  Some, infinitely smarter than I, day trade, swing trade, trade on margin, and make ridiculous profits. I‚Äôve tried, and that‚Äôs not for me. Instead, I  have decided to acquiesce. I‚Äôll be ‚Äúboring‚Äù, I‚Äôll DCA, I‚Äôll stay true to my decisions, I‚Äôll stop chasing the hot token.

I am certain it would solve 99% of the bullshit posts that we get ‚Äúwho else hates elon musk‚Äù / ‚Äútip to buy low sell high‚Äù / ‚Äúcommon sense taught me this one trick‚Äù / or whatever else is flavour of the month for moon farming. It would make the mods/admins lives easier too. the only downside I can think of (and please feel free to chime in with more) is that people are greedy, people who want more moons for the sake of it will not vote in favour. but legitimately I think it is in the subs best interest.  You could even have it based on current moon levels, so if you are in the top [XX%] of holders you would only be allocated [XX%], possibly akin to how tax brackets work. The more moons you already have the less you are entitled to. I don‚Äôt know enough about how stuff like this works to make a solid proposal, but I‚Äôm sure someone cleverer than me would be able to make a system that stops moon farming and still incentivises contribution. what do you think?",6

1616079703,"With ATOM rocketing today, I'd like to repost my ATOM price target.   Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx7wg5/z/gpm305k >My price target is $160. Yes, you heard that right. ***$160***.  >My PT analysis is based on a comparison of ATOM to it's main competitor, DOT. Both want to achieve an internet of blockchains by creating an interblockchain communication protocol.  >DOT's market cap (33bn) is currently over 6 times larger than ATOM's market cap (~5bn). This is despite Cosmos's ATOM: >1) **Having a working product.** ATOM deployed interblockchain communication a couple weeks ago. Polkadot still doesn't have a launch date on theirs.  >2) **The market cap of chains *already* using ATOM is higher than DOT's**. This trend is likely to continue as well, DOT removes blockchain sovereignty by forcing chains to use their shared security model. Larger chains like Binance chain (currently using ATOM) will never surrender sovereignty over their own chain. Btw, this is also why China is using Cosmos instead of Polkadot. ATOM's model allows chains to secure themselves, and soon, ATOM will be giving the option for chains to rent security from ATOM if they'd like as well. >3) **ATOM has near term catalysts that will allow for additional spikes in price.** They will be deploying an automated market maker as well as an ability for other chains to ""rent"" validators from the Cosmos Hub. Both are being deployed in the next couple months. ATOM holders will get a cut of fees related to the market maker and rented security.  >**Summary: There is no reason for DOT to be this far ahead of ATOM in market cap. I say this not to rag on DOT but to show how undervalued ATOM is. At a minimum, the two should be valued competitively. This means that ATOM could 6X in value before approaching parity with DOT. **",17

1616095132,"This tribalism over ADA is honestly fucking hilarious. Reading the daily it is like both sides are like the world is out to get them. As someone who sold their ADA at a large profit, but still really likes the project (hence why i invested to begin with) - i just don't get it. - There doesn't need to be an 'eth killer', and no eth isn't dead either, it is doing a great job, but has a massive scaling issue being worked on - that is what happens when you pave the way for all others to learn from your mistakes. Lots of developers and users still flock to it - if they didn't gas fees wouldn't be a thing. However of course, it is clearly still an issue and effects millions of retail investors who can't really use the system how they would like to right now - ADA is really good as a project, really interesting approach and i think it could be really successful, however it remains speculative (even within crypto) as it isn't yet finished - and that is ok. But please don't call it better than something which does work, has use and is being built on and adopted. ADA will get there, will it do it better long term? We don't know. It will be different, that is for sure.  - It isn't a slight to point out ADA isn't yet complete, or to mention gas fees are very high and an issue to be remedied. If someone mentions either of those to you, and it riles you up - you are probably way too emotionally engaged in your investment and should probably chill the fuck out. It's only code.  Crypto is the goal, a flourishing ecosystem of a huge number of platforms and approaches offering different things, back your horse for sure - but you should be cheering on everything, we are not in a zero sum game.",24

1616051096,"It can be complicated to understand but the network needs to be understood first. This idea of stellar is that there are anchors that can create tokens on the network, similar to creating a token on ethereum. Anchor A is a USD backed token and Token B is a EUR backed token. Stellar‚Äôs capability of path payments, which allows the network to use the Stellar‚Äôs inbuilt DEX to find the quickest and cheapest way to convert from one of the anchor tokens to another, is what most people don‚Äôt understand when we talk of currency conversion of the network. The flow in a path payment can flow through multiple tokens on the network not just anchor A and B but could flow through 10 tokens to make sure that the currency gets converted as close to the proper exchange rate as possible. XLM is the most liquid asset on the stellar DEX so it‚Äôs the most used in path payments. The work flow can go USD token -> XLM -> EUR token all within an instant so it wouldn‚Äôt matter what price XLM is as the transfer is basically instant unlike when we try to send bitcoin and it takes 10 mins and in that time frame the prices have changed. Another flow, if the USD token -> XLM -> EUR isn‚Äôt liquid enough to make a good exchange rate could instead go USD token -> KRW -> SLT -> BTC -> XLM -> EUR  The amazing fact of the DEX and path payments feature is that it will always find the best route so no matter what you do in a transfer of currencies the sender will always just be able to send USD if they wanted and the recipient will be able to chose whatever currency that‚Äôs supported on the network by an anchor to receive in. As more anchors get added to the network the more liquidity will be available to make the transfer as balanced as possible all automatically.",7

Even if BTC stays at exactly 60k during the bull run, the average alt would have to more than triple to get us down to 30% BTC dominance. edit: fuck, last ""bull run"", not last year.

1616089032,"ADA was an interesting case. Usually, Coinbase lists a new coin, THEN it pumps. But ADA is a very popular coin with a lot of people holding it, so everyone bought a bunch of it in advance of the Coinbase pump with the intention of immediately selling.",5
