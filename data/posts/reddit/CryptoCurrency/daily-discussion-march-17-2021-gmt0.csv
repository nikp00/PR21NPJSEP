Rather than the unabashed mania that washed over the world in 2017, this market feels like a consistent and natural maturation of the crypto sphere.  Good, bad, or other, huge corporations are buying in to the idea of crypto. Yes, Bitcoin is the main benefactor, currently; however, a rising sea brings everyone up. As fresh capital floods into crypto, confidence builds, projects advance, and values increase.  I for one think these are the first fledgling steps towards the inevitable future. Will Bitcoin replace the USD? I‚Äôd be an fool to give a definitive ‚Äúyes‚Äù, but will Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, become a legitimate store of value... yes.  Again, personal opinion here, but I feel as though we in this sub are among the vanguard of the future of finance. I understand that sounds hyperbolic, but I truly believe it. Gigantic corporations are scrambling to invest in Bitcoin, crypto ETFs are springing up everywhere, and we are all exactly where we need to be. All we have to do at this point is wait. The tides have turned, the winds shifted, and we stand ready to hold our coins and tokens as the rest of the world shifts towards us.

1615974640,"https://twitter.com/d0h0k1/status/1372115254511955969 So the bots trying to fuck the ANC launch got absolutely fucked: '3/ At around 4:50 pm KST, we noticed a meaningful scale DDoS attacks against Terra Station's public nodes, while at the same time attempts to swap into the yet unfunded ANC-UST pools. 4/ We could have funded the pools immediately at the time of the launch, but decided that contingency measures need to be taken for the launch to be fair.  So I decided to fuck with the attacker a little bit. 5/ We funded the ANC-UST pools at an exchange rate of 5M UST to 1 ANC - the bots proceeded to chew up the pools to the tune of 600-700k UST. 6/ I then proceeded to withdraw all liquidity and raise the price to 10M UST to 1 ANC - similar price-agnostic buying behavior.  We waited until the buys stopped. 7/ Then we proceeded to deploy the pools at the intended price and open the pools.  A quick skim through the initial purchase patterns shows that many people managed to acquire tokens.  We will be looking at the distribution map of ANC tokens shortly.' ANC launch was delayed and massive volatility - hope nobody got burned, but I will always love Do",8

Node holders, take note! * H&M has recently decided to scale up on #VeChain * VeChain is getting more involved in the healthcare sector. In talks with the administration in China regarding #COVID management solutions, similar the Cyprus solution. * Big European countries and Japan are approaching VeChain channel partners showing interest in solutions similar to the E-Hcert solution in Cyprus. Technically, it‚Äôs easy to implement, the challenge is local regulations. * Sunny highlights the lower network fees and innovations such as fee delegation that makes VeChain more attractive than alternatives such as Ethereum. Having a payment sponsor helps companies to focus on the business while the sponsor handles the crypto part. * Sunny highlights that changing $VTHO generation rate will involve community consensus and is a last resort. He reiterates that the price of VTHO itself is not a concern, maintaining steady tx costs is. And the levers are in place to do this. * will be pushing out a new developer support program headed by Peter Zhou that targets not just community developers, but also pro developers. Details to be announced soon * Sunny  hints at a new wallet  * VeChain & BYD partnership enters 3rd phase. * Collaboration with Crypto dotcom on NFT project  Very good news and I'm very pleased.

Going up nearly 20% since the day before. Jumping after a coinbase listing announcement.  * Another big mover is the brave little BAT. With over 35% up it now sits over $1. * LUNA continues to grow and show off. It really wants to honour its name. * As an extra show of force, LUNA kicked Doge down to 16. * VET didn't gain. Which is a positive thing because VET was on the verge of immense hatred due to the amount of mentions. * OMFG!!! ATOM made it above $20. Miracles still excist! Gratz, all you ATOM hodlers. * NANO didn't fall down further, though it's only 60m away from leaving the top 100. * MOONs snapshot incoming, /r/cc hyped, moon-farming intensifies. * BAT, LUNA and ADA are the biggest top 100 gainers of the day. Surprisingly, no gigantic 100% gains on any this time. But the majority is on green. * The biggest losers of the day are MANA, CHZ, HBAR, HOT, ENJ, MATIC and more, showing that huge gains tend to get followed up by big losses. * You're not so hot now, are you, HOT? (Just a silly joke I had to throw in there. I am both embarrassed and proud at the same time.) * Today's mental image is a relaxing grass field, where the people calmly partake in a romantic picnic, nothing really happeni... oh god, what's that? A huge crowd of people wearing ADA and BAT shirts, they're coming straight for us! Picnic ruined.",57

You'll have $70,000 per year to live on. If you believe in some predictions by some well known finance people e.g. BTC being $500,000 per BTC in 5-10 years. Then you've got yourself a plan.

The question here is basically how much more hype/speculation is there in comparison to actual new ADA buyers pumping money into it? Sorry, no one has the answer to that! I will mention one thing though - stimmy checks will start arriving today + tomorrow which could compound the effect this coinbase listing will have. And lastly, there is a crypto Africa conference on that same day where the founder of Cardano is speaking - there is a good chance an announcement of an official deal with an African government is mentioned there which *could* again compound the momentum of ADA. It would address the main criticism of ADA that it lacks large official projects. So basically I think there is a very real possibility that by luck 3 major events could be happening at the same time and could explode ADA. Maybe not though! DYOR blah blah etc.",11

The course is about $99 if I want the certificate and the graded items (not sure what that means). So I want to know: Is this a good place to start? Any alternatives? Should I go for the certification? Does it even matter in the blockchain industry? My ultimate objective is to be somewhat of an expert in blockchain and hopefully able to start a career from it or even a business. I am very excited and bullish by its potential but I don't know how to start.
