It's crazy how much crypto has blown up, and how much the space has advanced. How many of you guys are here from within the last 6 months?  Just curious, not meant to ask in a demeaning way.   I remember reading one of these threads for the first time in 2016 and putting $50 into tron because some random poster was recommending it.  I promptly went onto binance, bought it, sent it to a wallet I had just downloaded and never saw it again.  I sent it to an ETH address.  I felt crushed.  A learning moment.   Anyways, just reminiscing. A different time, but the excitement is still here - was always here, even during those bear years. We invest to make profits, but don't forget what this space is about; it's about democratizing the future of finance, and taking the power from a centralized force. I believe in that.

But ever since I concentrated on crypto, my game time is down like 99%. Every moment spent on a computer is either for working or researching crypto or learning about investing in general. Literally have not played a single new game since then, and current games are also dropped. So if any Asian parents out there have problems with your kids playing games too much, open him an Etoro or Binance account and let them YOLO their $ from a young age. Guaranteed it will be more productive than watching Fortnite or ""influencer"" videos on Youtube. It teaches (tiny bit of ) math, critical thinking, and can be entertaining (as long as you don't let your kid manage your portfolio).",6

Let's take a look at our shares and see how happy dogelord Elon is.  * The market cap rose to 1.98t, falling down to 1.89t after a random 90b cap coin got fixed.  * Daily rose to 13k.  * BTC didn't reach 2k.  * ETH didn't reach 60k.  * ETH killer ADA sat and pondered.  * LTC didn't reach 200  * Look, your fly is unzipped.  * XLM *did* reach 41 cents. * DOT pumped during dip. * LINK kicks THETA out of top 10 * FIL keeps pamping up to rank 12. * TRX pumped hard due to Paris Hilton * BTT keeping on going...  * DOGE pumped to 7 cents and is looking to enter the top 10 again.  * ETC again outshines ETH.  * ICX and RUNE newcomers on the shill list.  * LTO shilling remains high, though ETH is taking control.  * NANO shilling annoyed people after 3 comments.  * Well loved TRX was the biggest gainer in the top 100 with 39% * KSM with 8% the biggest loser.  * In the top 500 the biggest winners are KIMCHI with 118% and MAP with 104%.  * DREP is the biggest loser with 90% loss.  * The mental image of the day is a million grinning monkeys as they considered what jokes to make.",36
