1617377890,"I moved all of my BTC to a hardware wallet this morning - and I’ll be honest, it’s still a little nerve racking. I triple checked the address, and on top if that I spent 0.0005 BTC ($29 USD) to send the 0.001 BTC ($60 USD) thru as a test.  So some advice, if you ever do this in the future: 1. Do not click on links to get to your trading site. Enter it manually and check the URL after you get there. (I also suggest using a computer and not your phone). 2. Get a VPN!! It’s the only way to stay secure from those looking to see what your transferring or interfering. 3. Triple check the address that your sending your crypto to (given by your wallet software). 3. Send a small amount thru to your wallet to ensure everything works and there are no issues. (I know that sounds wasteful, but given what is at stake I think it’s worth it to do so. Better to lose $50 than all your transferring holdings).",9

1617370759,"BTT is surging, has anything actually happened with the project? Or is it still a bonified shitcoin and people are just getting duped into thinking it has utility? My thoughts, feel free to correct me? 1. It straight up doesn't work. The whole system was supposed to give you coins for uploading and encourage you to spend them for faster downloads. But it basically didn't track your upload accurately, and you'd wind up with half or less of what you were supposed to get. I reverted to an old version of BitTorrent promptly. 2. Even if it did work, the token is creating utility by adding friction. BitTorrent worked perfectly fine for like 15 years without being able to buy faster download speeds (which is still partially impacted by your network anyway). If anything, this kinda makes the whole concept of p2p sharing worse by enabling people to just be leeches if they have money. 3. Basically all of the key founders and coders at BitTorrent left, saying Justin Sun was clueless at how to create and manage good technology. 4. AFAIK, nothing has really changed with BTT nor has torrent usage seen a dramatic uptick in the last 2 years since launch to justify the price action.  5. The tokenomics seem manipulative to me, although I have this same feeling with any project that has hundreds of billions of tokens. Seems designed to take advantage of clueless noobs, who think they can buy in at less than a cent and ride to $100 like Bitcoin. Am I missing anything?",5

I've taken out 10% this time around (10% from each coin I hold) and all price action hypervigilance is gone. I upgraded my PC setup, beefed up my emergency fund, and bought some vintage Pokemon stuff I've always wanted but could never justify buying. My point is, if you feel that the value of your portfolio has too strong of a grip on you, don't be hesitant about cashing out a little and buying a thing or two that improves your quality of life or brings you joy. Especially if it's something you plan on keeping for a long time or an experience that will become a priceless memory. There's a big difference between checking prices every hour because you're excited about new price action and checking because a 2% dip makes you anxious about the start of a bear market.",17

I just don't see the DeFi universe moving to ADA smart contracts when other cryptocurrencies already have working ones that haven't captured even a fraction of ETH's marketshare.

A real surprise for the week is OGN, knowing the strong fundamentals I've been hodling it patiently and finally it paid off very well. ATH 2 days ago, small retracement and now is expected to go up again for real these days due to new upcoming NFTs drops with celebrities and NFT new launchpad.
