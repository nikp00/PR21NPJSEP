Yes but it also hasn't been able to yet. And long term HODLers are buying the dips.  ETH holding above 1500 feels pretty good to me, especially since it touched 1300 a few weeks ago. Also the only other market with futures and far easier to influence with only 200B market cap vs 1T for bitcoin. Add to the fact that there are less glass node metrics for ETH. I have to Imagine 1500 3/26 is a popular option. On top of that, new financial quarter, and the first quarter since Saylor's bitcoin conference. Institutions move slowly, so its reasonable to expect to see the first effects of the early adoption in Q2 this year.

1616662726,"$6bn BTC options to expire this month - Largest amount of CME options on BTC ever, and ETH all time high was the day ETH options opened on CME and it has plummeted on this drop toward expiry (seems to be holding now however - we are around a pretty solid gap on eth futures, s hopefully it holds here) End of Q1 reporting due as well. Massive selling pressure and carry trading positions being closed (hedging via long in the spot market, and short in futures) Nothing has changed, expect big volatility today and tomorrow, I see a green April ahead. (Note this is my opinion, I am known to be a moron) If you leverage trade - either cover your positions / hedge appropriately, or it may be a good idea to close them.  Personally I closed out two yesterday and I am comfortable holding the others through the volatility (could be a mistake of course - I don't know what will happen). ___ And a quick note on leveraged trading - if you are reading this, don't get it and want to try leveraged trading  but don't really understand it - please don't (or use extreme caution). I do it for a bit of fun and because I enjoy it, and generally I am not terrible at it.  But if these dips stress you out - imagine if the drop was combined with a multiplier anywhere between 2 - 125x as severe. Now imagine if you don't have enough capital to cover these positions - you will lose all of that money and any collateral you provided, because you don't own the asset you are borrowing it via a contract to repay it. Essentially you took a loan out on multipliers against the crypto market.  I suggest if you want to 'try' trading, do it with the spot market and small amounts. I do this as well, and it is 100x less stressful. I have had open long positions through every single correction we have had in 2021, a number of them very red when we were correcting - and i was ok with that, nevermind never even thinking about my portfolio (it really does not bother me when we go down). So if you are stressed by your portfolio being red, even in the slightest, avoid options trading.",23

Do you know what assets people buy to store their value? usually, if they wanted risk free rate, ""gold standard"" was to buy US Bonds. They yielded few percent. Now, their yield is zero. People are forced to buy stocks, gold, real estate, corporate bonds etc. Only thing it takes is Bitcoin being recognized as perfect and absolute store of value. From this point onward, it will suck all the money that was being tied in risky assets above. Just gold itself has market cap of 11T. Real estate? At the end of 2017 it was wort 280 Trillion. Today, peole buy it as store of value. Many times they dont even rent it. They just hold it because it does not depreciate as much as fiat.  This is potential never seen before.

1616689847, Last Day of Trading is the last Friday of contract month. Trading in expiring futures terminates at **4:00 p.m.** London time on Last Day of Trading.,6
1616715447,It hasn't really gone down at all for the last 2-3 days since BTC threw it's pissy fit. It's gonna be a hell of a bull when it gets the all clear soon.,9
1616715586,"Nothing to shill really.  Its got an amazing blockchain, with sharding technology.   Its super fast, low cost transactions Its now got a bridge to the Binance Smart Chain. They are SUPER active in terms of advancement. They are going to be here, they are going to be a force. They are what Cardano wants to be, they are what Cardano just told its people ""6 more months"" to wait for, but they're doing the same things in lightning speed. So if you're pumped for ADA's future, you can get a piece of that and more, today, with ONE.",8

1616630896,"Buy a little now, buy a little more if it dips more",6
1616632863,"I wouldn't really recommend ADA - its mostly vapourware in its current state and doesn't exactly deserve to be in spot number 4. The price still might appreciate higher due to the hype surrounding it, but if you dig deeper into the github, development and existence of ADA dapps you might be a bit disappointed. If you look at its marketcap in comparison to the existing product i don't think the risk vs upside potential is worth it. Just my 2 cents though.",6
1616635181,"HODL, dont try to jump around in a panic when you're in the red, unless they're just total shitcoins i guess, but if you're in the red, you literally can only sell at a loss.  Just hodl for now, and if you are gonna sell, do it on ATH days, not on dump days.",7

1616647887,"Yes to both here. Pretty solid projects with historical institutional interest, pending greyscale filings, and attractive staking rates even after accounting for token inflation. And if parachain auctions bump the price for dot as much as they have for ksm, it's probably in for a wild future.",5
1616647957,XLM,6
1616651021,"Yeah but who in their right mind would be selling while the institutions are buying. You arent gonna sell when people can buy tesla with btc and tesla aint selling those bitcoins. Yeah in hindsight it may be the top but i will also see it as a good decision to hodl right now even if we are down 50-60% in a few months. Narratives change, but now i think is the time to still hodl",4
1616657007,You new?,5
1616660506,I don't think you know XLM well enough,7
1616667379,"Ok, so you're fresh, or, you sold out your portfolio.   At the price levels it is, and I'm not one to normally recommend this, but BTC / ETH are gonna be a good start.   I mostly trade alts, but if you can get BTC under 50k and ETH 1500-1400 range.  They're gonna be solid, viable improving choices for you, short and long term. If you're looking for more risk to reward in the short term. Well, I'd need more information to determine what would suit you there.",5

1616704365,"It's because it's full of bagholders from the whole doge mess. No one is selling because they are trying to claw back their investment or are still clinging onto it hitting $1 (lol) And no one is buying because......well why would anyone be buying.

1616705041,Holding both right now but I went and bought Algo on this dip.,6
1616705141,ALGO!,6
1616705549,Algo has smart contracts for 10 months but not even a dex has built there which is really odd. I'd go ATOM. I don't hold either.,5
