1615423471,"Hi all, I wanna warn the new crypto fans about pump & dumps. A pump & dump, also called P&D, is usually organised by either a whale (person with a lot of money or crypto) or a group of people. They want to encourage other investors to buy crypto, in order to do this they inflate the price artificially by buying a large amount (That's why Binance shows big % increases in 5 minute notifications) ,then selling their own shares while the price is high. This cause the price to make a big nose dive, in most cases they wouldn't come down entirely because people keep buying it in the hope that it will keep going up higher, which is most cases won't. The person or group behind this make a big profit while many others can easily lose 20% - 40% or even 75% of their investment within a few minutes. My advice is to ignore those massive pumps cause you either get a small profit if you exit fast enough (5% - 10%, if lucky) or you lose a big chunk of your investment. Please play it safe and don't chase the pumps.",20

Going from 55k to 57k and bouncing around a lot between 56k and 57k * BTC gaining 1.3% dominance.  * ETH disappointing its fans by not even hitting 1.9k. Their tears falling on bitcoin's gilded road. * ATOM was unable to hold its $20. * XLM shows it can be less stable by moving down some. * Most alts down from the day before. Some are calling it a dip. The wiser call it sideways movement.  * FTM's big pump was stopped short and FTM fell down some afterwards. * VET seems to want to move below 6 cents.  * BAT showing off again, almost breaking 2018 ATH.  * Bitcoin gold somehow one of today's gainers.  * Random person talked about being bullish on BCH. * Hatred for personal stories is greener than any crypto gains. * Most still up for the week!  * Mostly unknown to westerners NEM is this week's biggest top 100 loser with a 25% drop.  * NEM also biggest loser of the day with 16% down, followed by FTM with 14% down.  * THETA's fuel is the biggest top 100 gainer of the day with 64% up! * CHZ biggest top 100 gainer of the week with 189% followed by the fuel with 138% up.  * Today mental image is the big king solo-stampeding all the alts, destroying their beautiful green dildos and revealing the blood inside.

They are strictly investing in BTC but not crypto.  In the past people who buy BTC are crypto investors, they build portfolio around BTC but money do leak into alts.  But now people buy BTC as its own entity.  I liken this to there are Los Angeles Lakers fans and there are Kobe Bryant fans.  Kobe fans buy Kobe shoes and jersey, while Lakers fans buy Kobe stuff and other Lakers stuff.  I think the market now is more dominated by Kobe (BTC) fans than Lakers (crypto) fans. Thoughts?",14

Because the bigger nodes were fast enough, the network didn't really slow down, but the ledger did get bloated with over 12gb of spam tx's. Nano dev's told the nodes to greatly reduce bandwidth, so that the smaller nodes could keep up without being knocked off, so currently Nano isn't nearly as fast at the moment because it's being throttled. Apparently it sounds like Nano's built in spam protection needs some work because it didn't kick in because the faster nodes could handle it.

If you want to be fast, you need a fee at even just a penny, but a fee nonetheless. This attack is costing the attacker maybe $10 a day max and it‚Äôs slowed down the network. Be completely feeless seems infeasible at this point, as what‚Äôs to stop someone from doing a similar attack and bringing the network to a halt if it‚Äôs adopted? That‚Äôs a big reason it might struggle to get adopted unless they fix the issue. I get it‚Äôs eco-friendly and that‚Äôs great! But a ton of coins already address that issue.

1615428697,"I bought XLM at 0.07 when others were fearful. At that time it was even worst. XLM fell out of top 10 all the way to top 20. Then it shot back up to top 10 when Ukraine news happened. It is one of those coins that will be around, and Stellar is here to stay.  That 0.07 buy was worth it. So worth it. Everyone was losing hope. Just like now. Some of you are getting frustrated. However, others see opportunities, and I am one of them. I am not the type of person to buy the pump. That‚Äôs how you end up with heavy bags you don‚Äôt want.  The trick is easy. You really buy low and sell high. I don‚Äôt get frustrated as I stack lumens because I also trade other coins. Therefore, I don‚Äôt keep looking at my heavy bag of lumens. Wishing you a Stellar day!
