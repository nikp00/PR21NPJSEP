1617149777,Here is the recent interview with the CEO of LTO Network Rick Schmitz on CryptosRus: https://youtu.be/hC6WkNIytJE Highlights: - Partnership is going very well with the United Nations and the land registry is a big success in Afghanistan. There is more than 2 more countries in the pipeline to come on board for land registry as well. - Partnership with IBM is going great. They are working on using blockchain and data to assist with making the process of dealing with petty crimes more seamless. The other project with IBM is around sensor data on buildings to measure pollution etc. - Partnered with Chainlink to bring DeFi to the LTO Network in Q3,45

1617161566,"We had two bags of shitcoins, seventy-five pellets of UNI , five sheets of high powered NFTs, a salt shaker half full of ETH, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored low caps, defis, food coins, meme coins... and also a quart of BNB, a quart of ADA, a case of LTC, a pint of wrapped BTC and two dozen LINK. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious shitcoin collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the XRP. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an XRP binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon‚Ä¶ ![gif](giphy|76dX1wy9elm0g)",42

If you round up!!! * BTT somehow seeing more growth, hitting 0.46 cents and rank 25. *shakes head* * ATOM proudly grows a few tall hairs to barely coe above * CAKE follow big bro BNB and shoots up some more as well. * HOT is feeling extra hot! * New top 100 entry, DREP, has seen a significant decrease in volume while CMC messes things up again. This made DREP bullish. It since left the top 100, though the market cap claims 9b. CMC is such a bugfest. * Recently destroyed PAID is seeing gains of over 40% in th past 24 hours. * Reddit's Moons have gone up to 9.5 cents now sitting at 8 cents. Redditors are picking out lambo colours. * The top 100's biggest gainers of the day were HOT with a very impressive 39%, ZRX??? with 23% and BTT with 19%. yeps, altcoin market is here. * Over the past 7 days there were plenty of big gainers, but only HOT managed above 100%, (136%) * On the top 100 loser side, BTMX takes the crown with 11% on the day and 20% on the week. * Looking into the top 500, the biggest gainers of the day were VSYS with 80%, MARO with 60% and, wait... KARMA with 630%. Thanks KARMA, though I don't actually own you, it's nice to see my paper experiment might have you turn a profit anywyay. * BOTX keeps sucking and lost 28%. * On today's mental image, HOT and MOONS joined the GINYU force.
