1616366736,There are so many coins now that have good prospects for development,7
1616372680,"Hi! I'm pretty new into crypto and especially trading. I have a question, certainly dumb but couldn't find a clear answer.  Imagine that I buy 1000 dollars worth of a certain coin which the value is 10 dollars for one coin, so I've got 100 of it. Tomorrow, the value of this coin goes up to 11 dollars, I decide to sell everything I have : I receive approximatively 1100 dollars (minus some fees).  So I would have done 100 dollars benefits... the scenario I wrote is pretty likely to happen with any coin... but it seems too good to be true : am I missing something in my calculations or in the profit I would make? Are there any other risks than : the coin could just lose value to a point where I will loose money, my coins could be losed/stolen if the exchange disappeared or got hacked ?

My mind, however, has changed in this short period and I don't think trading (particularily short term trading) is what I want to do. I'd like to focus more on long term and fundamentals. How do I assess the fundamentals of a project? Are there any good places to read or resources for learning?

XPR (Proton) will allow retail use with a second layer, and crypto market as well. Love the second tier protection for retail, though and the MCAP is only 50M. Finally, we have DRC which if I understand will allow us to stake multiple coins but if we want to cash out we can flip every coin we are farming into ETH or DRC with one click. Super easy, super cheap and an MCAP of only 15M. Anyone got better insight into this than I do.",3

1616386762,"The scenario you describe is pretty much all there is to it. Of course, the trading fees will vary per exchange and there is always the risk that the coin will decrease in value. (there is no guarantee that any coin will increase in value, there is always a risk associated with investing)  a lot of people will say that if you do not own the keys to your crypto then you don't own the crypto so if you are buying with the sole intention of holding, then you should do research as to what wallet you want to use to store your crypto. If you are planning to trade then holding your coins in an exchange would be enough (maybe hold a portion on an external wallet if you have large quantities)",9
1616738925,"Yes, in crypto space, the volatility is nothing like any existing financial assets because of the decentralized nature. There's a chance of new coins getting rugpull and there's also a chance where your 1000 dollar 100x to $100k in a year.  You may forget your passphrases or password, and they will be lost forever.  There are also the different fees involved in different platforms that will deduct your net profit but what are those fees compared to the 100x you gained.  Important thing is to do your research properly and handle your keys properly. Hacking is done everywhere, even banks so there's no escaping that in crypto or not. That is all your luck, but if your coins are in cold storage, you're quite safe.  mod up if useful, thanks.

1616356928," I'm really excited about tokens on the bsc network and the costs of swapping tokens compared to uniswap and the eth mainnet. Looking at comparisons between tokens, like   GSPI [https://bscscan.com/token/0xb42e1c3902b85b410334f5fff79cdc51fbee6950?a=0xe8B9D9FaA27E0A9574187cB285Ac18944E450Ad3](https://bscscan.com/token/0xb42e1c3902b85b410334f5fff79cdc51fbee6950?a=0xe8B9D9FaA27E0A9574187cB285Ac18944E450Ad3)   compared to   SPI [https://etherscan.io/token/0x9b02dd390a603add5c07f9fd9175b7dabe8d63b7](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9b02dd390a603add5c07f9fd9175b7dabe8d63b7)   it's a difference of 10x! I think that doing these cross comparisons between similar companies on different networks and looking at the potential to grow or match the other  network help my mind when checking out which tokens to invest in and how they might grow?",1
1616381136,Trading on Comethswap. Layer 2 DEX so i no longer suffer gas fees like i did with Uniswap.,1
1616400638,Bittrex/binance/coinbase pro/kucoin/kraken. I like bittrex the most personally. I use kucoin mostly to explore/learn about different cryptos and buy whatever I cant get on bittrex/coinbase pro. I dont actually use binance at all but it's a popular one and same with kraken.,3

1616641282,"Looks like BTC is forming an inverse cup and handle. I guess overnight could this mean a test of support at $47k and then $43k? If so it’s a great buying opportunity or will the shorts continue and drive it down to mid-$35k’s?  IMHO, the big WS institutions want in and they don’t plan to buy high. They hv the potential to supplant Grayscale, TLSA and MSTR as lead shareholders. Retail investors (not whales) can’t keep this from happening as stats show most buyers after $35k were primarily retail investors and not whales. My 2c.",2

1617150835,That’s a hidden gem. Do we know what happened with their UNISWAP listing?,1
1616417640,Thanks for your answer 😁,1
1616436943,Same!,3
1616753148,"Hope you kept holding, the whale is finally doing the thing. The play was obvious but timing was tough... Especially with Bitcoin dropping.",1
1616456058,Probably going to dip a bit more. Not sure about why but look at the Fibonacci charts. Shows a downside to maybe even 52k. I’m am not a financial advisor in anyway!,1
1616458190,"Based on a lot of people who chart and do TA on it, its an expected correction that was supposed to happen this week.",1
1616738294,Something about maximum pain point at $44k for bitcoin options and a tendency to gravitate towards that price. So maybe a little more correction in the short term.,1
1616366529,Probably won't be long now.,1
1616823450,"Bro, is it Ever.  Also been enjoying watching HOT grow today, Holochain DYOR. Thank me at the of 2021.",1
1616415589,I’ll definitely look into it,1
1616618683,True. Very good advice,1

1616618766,Thanks for the recommendation,2
1616623269,Time to buy into it again ;) before another lift off,1
1616790349,I just noticed it when it came to coinbase and from everything Ive read it seems like it has a solid future. I’m at a decent profit so far and only expect it to grow more.,2

1616777720,"Dude why the FUD? You obviously don’t like these tokens and have no real argument, safemoon copied Hoge and now a bunch of other coins are copying them too the only difference is safemoon has been there longer and had time to get their things done, the others are getting there too, just give it time",1
1616779010,"I mean you say that safemars owner is excluded from fees and that seems to be a red flag to you but in safemoon, that massive whale holding 48Trillion tokens is also excluded from fees but still gets the rewards... go look it up on bscscan! That whale has been dumping huge amounts everytime the price pumps",1
1616930940,I’m on binance.us,1
1617475647,"Tbh Uniswap is really good if you got a big capital (at least $1k), its easy just have a coinbase wallet then u can go to uniswap straight from the app, you need ETH tho to trade for any ERC20 token.",1
1616998906,Oh you are half way to being a millionaire.,1
1617478114,I agree with you. Did some research and came up with similar findings. Also I think it has the potential to hit atleast $10 in the near future considering the fact that it has half the supply of ripple (xrp) and that ripple was able to peak at a high over $3.,2
1616860308,By far is quickswap.exchange on the matic network.  You will need to get matic tokens on coinbase or another centralized exchange. Then you will need to set up metamask to use matic.  Most expensive part it getting matic tokens on matic network.  If you are in EU you can buy matic tokens directly on quickswap,2
1616909936,Why?,1
1616365508,"LOL) Okay, I'm already hoping for this one, but haven't bought it yet",1

1616620133,I'll check it out. Thanks,1
1616676665,Make sure their smart contracts have been audited for security!!  Oh I checked! Audited by VIDAR.  I may move my farming here!!,1
1616641474,I guess it will dip more till the sell pressure is lifted,2
1617158837,It’s on bitforex. I know tokensniffer said it was a scam but it wasn’t the actual Omi. There are multiple Omi contracts on bsc that are fakes. Launches on Uniswap tomorrow I believe.,1

1616790400,Ha that's exactly the same way I came upon it. Traded in some ethereum for some extra just for shits and gigs.,1
1616873968,BTT 🙃,1
1616877310,The cheapest place to trade for it is Matic network.  quickswap.exchange,1
1616366920,"Recently I decided to try another platform, before that I used Compound Finance. I found Pumpy Farm and so far I've settled on it, counting the income including all expenses. Managing all the assets from one panel is very convenient",2
1616367118,autofarm platforms are actually very interesting in their concept,1
1616673105,Yes add an indicator and then type in whatever you want rsi macd boll bands,1
1616771943,I currently own none of these. There is nothing stopping them from putting their code into github now for review.,1
1616781416,This isn't FUD I'm merely pointing out the what I see as issues with the contracts. Also I cannot read the HOGE contract for comparison.,1
1616781337,If you read I said BOTH tokens/contracts owners are exempt from fees.  I own neither of these tokens.,1
1616999052,Well see. It’s just one of a few,2
1617478410,"Nice, it is definitely one to long term hold on to. I’ve been trying to slowly diversify and accumulate a variety of solid coins, that also just have really cool potential and technology. The main ones I really like are XLM, ADA, and DOT. Also CRO seems to be moving in a very solid direction.",2
1616955948,Did you check today?,2
1617067677,"Indeed sir, not sure when platinum will be released tho. When they pull it off it’s gonna be a Tokenized Precious Metal dealer !",2
1616790642,Seems like the community on the sub forum grows by the second so I think it’s going to blow up quickly.,2
1616366977,"Thank you, check it out.",1
1616673282,Didn't get it,1
1616772006,Then I will talk to them in the chats and I am sure they will accept,1
1616781517,I just checked with my own contract address and it also says I am excluded from fees... But I do pay the tax when I buy so this makes no sense lol 🤣,1
1617478939,Yep,2
1616961672,Yeah but what happens today doesn’t make something a long term option,1
1617189304,No doubt about it! They're also meant to be launching tokenised Stocks and ETFs so they're really going to cover most of the options of commodity trading and beyond!,1
1616793119,"I like this narrative. I'm just messing around in coinbase and only have like a hundred bucks invested. 65% bitcoin, 10% ethereum, and 25% ankr. Obviously I'm not out to make a profit or anything,  just dipping my toes in to analyze trends and stuff as a newb.",1

1617134324,There we go.,2
1616786348,"There is insufficient liquidity to buy Safemoon on pancakeswap.  I tried to buy 60,000,000 and various other amounts.  Insufficient liquidity. There are apparently no  tokens  to buy currently.",1
