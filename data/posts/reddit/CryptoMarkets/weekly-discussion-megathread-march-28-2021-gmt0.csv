1617195582,"The basic principle is supply vs demand. Very rarely, even in gold, are you actually trading against the real asset. All these non-crypto assets have been around in one form or another for a a very long time, and humans as they are have figured how to trade against it, regardless of price, and regardless if it even really exists. Moral of the story, people have learned they don't need to trust rich assholes and banks, and every peer on the blockchain can see the circulating supply without worrying more will be shot out of thin air. This brings full transparent value to the asset, and therefore will be forever valuable until a better angle comes into play, or all of our computer systems combust.    Coming back to your question, there is rationality if you know the principles of how it works although that is not to say there are those blindly exaggerating. Will it go up? Yes. Down? Yes. Where you exit your position, if at all, is what will make or break you.  Keep a reserve to offset your losses. Buy the asset, and use it as collateral to grow in lower markets instead of selling low. No need to sell and settle on older manipulated assets. I'm not completely against them, hence the idea of diversifying your portfolio. Personally I have 80% in crypto. 50% of that is HODL and earn interest, the other 50% is day trading for smaller daily gains. Zoom out to look at the big picture, and don't believe anyone that says they know. We can assume based on principle and probability, but we can never know until we have experienced it.",2
1617241892,"I'd say people always want to believe prices will go up forever. Technical analysis and fundamentals are definitely affected by confirmation bias.

I do find it weird that every time BTC bumps up everyone is saying ""this is it, here go, BTC is rocketing to $80, $100k, $300k""  And then the second BTC drops everyone is ""dont panic, dont sell your BTC, ya gotta have diamond hands to deal with up to  %50 drops in the crypto market.

1617364524,Yeah I bought it last week. It’s a good move. I think everyone should buy in.,2
1617212573,"I'll do my best to break it down: -Metamask is essentially an online wallet that is integrated onto most platforms. It helps verify you are withdrawing certain coins to your actual address. Takeaway, it is a wallet. -MyConstant is a peer to peer lending platform. You can take out cash loans while using your crypto as collateral OR you can lend out cash to others and earn interest OR you can use it as an online wallet as well as earn interest in crypto. The ladder interest only applies to BTC, ETH, and BNB. Example of how I use it is as follows:  -- I deposit 0.2 worth of BTC into MyConstant ($11,800 value). Then I use 0.15 ($8850 value) as collateral to get a 6 month loan for $4425. I send that cash to Binance and use 3commas to trade daily with that cash for 6 months. I keep the remaining .05 BTC in MyConstant wallet earning 8% APY in BTC, and if value of BTC drops alot, lets say 30%, I add that remaining balance to the collateral of my existing loan to avoid liquidation and keep the loan alive. At the end of 6 months, I can either refinance, or pay off the loan, in this case $4425 + interest owed. Once paid, I receive back my collateral 0.15 BTC, regardless of its value. Given its nature, the value of BTC generally appreciates in 6 months time, so it's just like HODLing, and using your holdings to get more cash to play with. The key is to get full off of a small spoon. Shoot for 1% gains on day trading. It adds up. -Day trading is a loose term in my post, and some trades can take a few days to complete. I use bots that utilize DCA, or dollar cost averaging. So each deal, lets say starts with $10, and buys more as price decreases on each coin. I am a believer in high frequency, so I prefer 20 small deals over 5 big ones, and limit each deal to use no more than a total of $500. To actually see consistent returns ($10 -$100/day) I recommend trading with a total of $5000 or more. If you are working with less than that, you are better off with taking the loan from My Constant and splitting it to hold your favorite cryptos long term. Always keep extra cash on the side for when things go south. In those scenarios, you buy more. That is the beauty of dollar cost averaging. -liquidity mining is essentially the decentralized way of mimicking how banks like to fuck everyone, buy instead giving the power to the people. A bank takes a loan of lets say $1 million at 1% APR. They then loan out that many to people at a higher interest rate. The difference is their profit. In liquidity mining, you are essentially the source of the money that the network is using to exchange/trade. The fees that peers are paying are passed onto you, hence your earned interest. I have not used keeperDAO, so I don't have much value to provide there. Regardless, each exchange has liquidity pools for different coins. You put up your crypto, and then earn that interest. Better opportunities lie with less popular coins, so in those scenarios you exchange your earnings for a crypto you want to store your longterm value; in your case ETH. Every pool is different, so look at the terms(restrictions, interest earned, bonuses, etc). -Helium mining uses radio signals to communicate with other nodes. The purpose of the network is to give global access to IoT devices that can't normally get internet (GPS chips, etc). You are rewarded in HNT. You can then take those earnings and convert to any crypto you want on an exchange if you want. Hope that helps you friend. Start small. Put up what you are willing to lose. Be strategic, not hopeful.  Small spoon will give you a big belly ✌🏼",7
