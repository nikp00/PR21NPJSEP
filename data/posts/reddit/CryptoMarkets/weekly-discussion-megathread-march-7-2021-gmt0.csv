1615473941,"Pigeoncoin (PGN) was created around the same time as Ravencoin, both with anti ASIC campaigns in mind! Where as RVN uses randomization of algorithms to fight asic mining, PGN uses a shuffle which also helps swap algorithms in a non linear way, making it harder to mine with asic and rather promoting individual miners with graphics cards. Pigeoncoin is shifting to masternodes with a focus on the social media space and it remains operated by the community. Pigeoncoin messenger being worked on and has potential to disrupt the space! Place to pickup would be CoinEX exchange. MotaCoin (MOTA) has also been around since 2018, it is a dispensary coin with a couple places currently accepting it in lieu of fiat! MotaCoin has a smaller max supply of 100 million and with the marijuana craze it has potential to big moon shot! Currently trading at .005 per coin! SatoExchange/Frei exchange to pickup MOTA!

1616178196,"Very smart to be considering that - one thing I found was comparing withdrawal fees between different coins can be helpful. For example, Coinbase charges varying degrees of fees for each crypto to transfer off the platform EXCEPT EOS and XLM are free for some reason... so since you can generally convert free on Coinbase (besides likely losing some slippage they take advantage of) I just convert it before transferring off and convert back on my interest earning platform.  Likewise, Binance.US has vastly different fees to withdraw different coins and some make it cost prohibitive unless you have really large orders, EXCEPT for some reason NEO is free to withdraw!  Unfortunately you can‚Äôt easily convert on Binance.US (unless you swap into BTC pairs), but this is still great to know. Also I‚Äôve found Celsius doesn‚Äôt take out fees on my withdrawals so I really like earning interest there since you also don‚Äôt have to lock up your assets for any period of time either. I can‚Äôt post a referral link to give us both free BTC because apparently this will get you banned on here.  The ones who have charged me fees to withdraw were Crypto.com and Coinbase wallet (way more fees than actual Coinbase). I withdrew $100 ETH and ended up with only $80 due to getting hit with both fees. Thought that was crazy to charge fees for a deposit too! So watch out for those too. Hope this helps!",1
